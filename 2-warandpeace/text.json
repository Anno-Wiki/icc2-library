[{"offset": 0, "text": "BOOK ONE: 1805\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\n\u201cWell, Prince, so Genoa and Lucca are now just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I warn you, if you don\u2019t tell me that this means war, if you still try to defend the infamies and horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist\u2014I really believe he is Antichrist\u2014I will have nothing more to do with you and you are no longer my friend, no longer my \u2018faithful slave,\u2019 as you call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have frightened you\u2014sit down and tell me all the news.\u201d\n\nIt was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the well-known Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer, maid of honor and favorite of the Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna. With these words she greeted Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin, a man of high rank and importance, who was the first to arrive at her reception. Anna P\u00e1vlovna had had a cough for some days. She was, as she said, suffering from la grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. Petersburg, used only by the elite.\n\nAll her invitations without exception, written in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liveried footman that morning, ran as follows:\n\n\u201cIf you have nothing better to do, Count (or Prince), and if the prospect of spending an evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, I shall be very charmed to see you tonight between 7 and 10\u2014Annette Sch\u00e9rer.\u201d\n\n\u201cHeavens! what a virulent attack!\u201d replied the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this reception. He had just entered, wearing an embroidered court uniform, knee breeches, and shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene expression on his flat face. He spoke in that refined French in which our grandfathers not only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, patronizing intonation natural to a man of importance who had grown old in society and at court. He went up to Anna P\u00e1vlovna, kissed her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, and shining head, and complacently seated himself on the sofa.\n\n\u201cFirst of all, dear friend, tell me how you are. Set your friend\u2019s mind at rest,\u201d said he without altering his tone, beneath the politeness and affected sympathy of which indifference and even irony could be discerned.\n\n\u201cCan one be well while suffering morally? Can one be calm in times like these if one has any feeling?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \u201cYou are staying the whole evening, I hope?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the fete at the English ambassador\u2019s? Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appearance there,\u201d said the prince. \u201cMy daughter is coming for me to take me there.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought today\u2019s fete had been canceled. I confess all these festivities and fireworks are becoming wearisome.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf they had known that you wished it, the entertainment would have been put off,\u201d said the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by force of habit said things he did not even wish to be believed.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t tease! Well, and what has been decided about Novos\u00edltsev\u2019s dispatch? You know everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can one say about it?\u201d replied the prince in a cold, listless tone. \u201cWhat has been decided? They have decided that Buonaparte has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are ready to burn ours.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli always spoke languidly, like an actor repeating a stale part. Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer on the contrary, despite her forty years, overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. To be an enthusiast had become her social vocation and, sometimes even when she did not feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order not to disappoint the expectations of those who knew her. The subdued smile which, though it did not suit her faded features, always played round her lips expressed, as in a spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her charming defect, which she neither wished, nor could, nor considered it necessary, to correct.\n\nIn the midst of a conversation on political matters Anna P\u00e1vlovna burst out:\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t speak to me of Austria. Perhaps I don\u2019t understand things, but Austria never has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vocation and will be true to it. That is the one thing I have faith in! Our good and wonderful sovereign has to perform the noblest role on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, which has become more terrible than ever in the person of this murderer and villain! We alone must avenge the blood of the just one.... Whom, I ask you, can we rely on?... England with her commercial spirit will not and cannot understand the Emperor Alexander\u2019s loftiness of soul. She has refused to evacuate Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some secret motive in our actions. What answer did Novos\u00edltsev get? None. The English have not understood and cannot understand the self-abnegation of our Emperor who wants nothing for himself, but only desires the good of mankind. And what have they promised? Nothing! And what little they have promised they will not perform! Prussia has always declared that Buonaparte is invincible, and that all Europe is powerless before him.... And I don\u2019t believe a word that Hardenburg says, or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neutrality is just a trap. I have faith only in God and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. He will save Europe!\u201d\n\nShe suddenly paused, smiling at her own impetuosity.\n\n\u201cI think,\u201d said the prince with a smile, \u201cthat if you had been sent instead of our dear Wintzingerode you would have captured the King of Prussia\u2019s consent by assault. You are so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?\u201d\n\n\u201cIn a moment. \u00c0 propos,\u201d she added, becoming calm again, \u201cI am expecting two very interesting men tonight, le Vicomte de Mortemart, who is connected with the Montmorencys through the Rohans, one of the best French families. He is one of the genuine \u00e9migr\u00e9s, the good ones. And also the Abb\u00e9 Morio. Do you know that profound thinker? He has been received by the Emperor. Had you heard?\u201d\n\n\u201cI shall be delighted to meet them,\u201d said the prince. \u201cBut tell me,\u201d he added with studied carelessness as if it had only just occurred to him, though the question he was about to ask was the chief motive of his visit, \u201cis it true that the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron by all accounts is a poor creature.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli wished to obtain this post for his son, but others were trying through the Dowager Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna to secure it for the baron.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna almost closed her eyes to indicate that neither she nor anyone else had a right to criticize what the Empress desired or was pleased with.\n\n\u201cBaron Funke has been recommended to the Dowager Empress by her sister,\u201d was all she said, in a dry and mournful tone.\n\nAs she named the Empress, Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s face suddenly assumed an expression of profound and sincere devotion and respect mingled with sadness, and this occurred every time she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She added that Her Majesty had deigned to show Baron Funke beaucoup d\u2019estime, and again her face clouded over with sadness.\n\nThe prince was silent and looked indifferent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna P\u00e1vlovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring to speak as he had done of a man recommended to the Empress) and at the same time to console him, so she said:\n\n\u201cNow about your family. Do you know that since your daughter came out everyone has been enraptured by her? They say she is amazingly beautiful.\u201d\n\nThe prince bowed to signify his respect and gratitude.\n\n\u201cI often think,\u201d she continued after a short pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smiling amiably at him as if to show that political and social topics were ended and the time had come for intimate conversation\u2014\u201cI often think how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are distributed. Why has fate given you two such splendid children? I don\u2019t speak of Anatole, your youngest. I don\u2019t like him,\u201d she added in a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising her eyebrows. \u201cTwo such charming children. And really you appreciate them less than anyone, and so you don\u2019t deserve to have them.\u201d\n\nAnd she smiled her ecstatic smile.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t help it,\u201d said the prince. \u201cLavater would have said I lack the bump of paternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t joke; I mean to have a serious talk with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with your younger son? Between ourselves\u201d (and her face assumed its melancholy expression), \u201che was mentioned at Her Majesty\u2019s and you were pitied....\u201d\n\nThe prince answered nothing, but she looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. He frowned.\n\n\u201cWhat would you have me do?\u201d he said at last. \u201cYou know I did all a father could for their education, and they have both turned out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but Anatole is an active one. That is the only difference between them.\u201d He said this smiling in a way more natural and animated than usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth very clearly revealed something unexpectedly coarse and unpleasant.\n\n\u201cAnd why are children born to such men as you? If you were not a father there would be nothing I could reproach you with,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, looking up pensively.\n\n\u201cI am your faithful slave and to you alone I can confess that my children are the bane of my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is how I explain it to myself. It can\u2019t be helped!\u201d\n\nHe said no more, but expressed his resignation to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna P\u00e1vlovna meditated.\n\n\u201cHave you never thought of marrying your prodigal son Anatole?\u201d she asked. \u201cThey say old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and though I don\u2019t feel that weakness in myself as yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy with her father. She is a relation of yours, Princess Mary Bolk\u00f3nskaya.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli did not reply, though, with the quickness of memory and perception befitting a man of the world, he indicated by a movement of the head that he was considering this information.\n\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d he said at last, evidently unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, \u201cthat Anatole is costing me forty thousand rubles a year? And,\u201d he went on after a pause, \u201cwhat will it be in five years, if he goes on like this?\u201d Presently he added: \u201cThat\u2019s what we fathers have to put up with.... Is this princess of yours rich?\u201d\n\n\u201cHer father is very rich and stingy. He lives in the country. He is the well-known Prince Bolk\u00f3nski who had to retire from the army under the late Emperor, and was nicknamed \u2018the King of Prussia.\u2019 He is very clever but eccentric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. She has a brother; I think you know him, he married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de-camp of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s and will be here tonight.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, dear Annette,\u201d said the prince, suddenly taking Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s hand and for some reason drawing it downwards. \u201cArrange that affair for me and I shall always be your most devoted slave-slafe with an f, as a village elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich and of good family and that\u2019s all I want.\u201d\n\nAnd with the familiarity and easy grace peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor\u2019s hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in another direction.\n\n\u201cAttendez,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, reflecting, \u201cI\u2019ll speak to Lise, young Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s wife, this very evening, and perhaps the thing can be arranged. It shall be on your family\u2019s behalf that I\u2019ll start my apprenticeship as old maid.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s drawing room was gradually filling. The highest Petersburg society was assembled there: people differing widely in age and character but alike in the social circle to which they belonged. Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s daughter, the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, came to take her father to the ambassador\u2019s entertainment; she wore a ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The youthful little Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya, known as la femme la plus s\u00e9duisante de P\u00e9tersbourg, was also there. She had been married during the previous winter, and being pregnant did not go to any large gatherings, but only to small receptions. Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s son, Hippolyte, had come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. The Abb\u00e9 Morio and many others had also come.\n\nTo each new arrival Anna P\u00e1vlovna said, \u201cYou have not yet seen my aunt,\u201d or \u201cYou do not know my aunt?\u201d and very gravely conducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come sailing in from another room as soon as the guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna P\u00e1vlovna mentioned each one\u2019s name and then left them.\n\nEach visitor performed the ceremony of greeting this old aunt whom not one of them knew, not one of them wanted to know, and not one of them cared about; Anna P\u00e1vlovna observed these greetings with mournful and solemn interest and silent approval. The aunt spoke to each of them in the same words, about their health and her own, and the health of Her Majesty, \u201cwho, thank God, was better today.\u201d And each visitor, though politeness prevented his showing impatience, left the old woman with a sense of relief at having performed a vexatious duty and did not return to her the whole evening.\n\nThe young Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya had brought some work in a gold-embroidered velvet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more sweetly, and was especially charming when she occasionally drew it down to meet the lower lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly attractive woman, her defect\u2014the shortness of her upper lip and her half-open mouth\u2014seemed to be her own special and peculiar form of beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of this pretty young woman, so soon to become a mother, so full of life and health, and carrying her burden so lightly. Old men and dull dispirited young ones who looked at her, after being in her company and talking to her a little while, felt as if they too were becoming, like her, full of life and health. All who talked to her, and at each word saw her bright smile and the constant gleam of her white teeth, thought that they were in a specially amiable mood that day.\n\nThe little princess went round the table with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself and to all around her. \u201cI have brought my work,\u201d said she in French, displaying her bag and addressing all present. \u201cMind, Annette, I hope you have not played a wicked trick on me,\u201d she added, turning to her hostess. \u201cYou wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, and just see how badly I am dressed.\u201d And she spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with a broad ribbon just below the breast.\n\n\u201cSoyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be prettier than anyone else,\u201d replied Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said the princess in the same tone of voice and still in French, turning to a general, \u201cmy husband is deserting me? He is going to get himself killed. Tell me what this wretched war is for?\u201d she added, addressing Prince Vas\u00edli, and without waiting for an answer she turned to speak to his daughter, the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\n\u201cWhat a delightful woman this little princess is!\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nOne of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily built young man with close-cropped hair, spectacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown dress coat. This stout young man was an illegitimate son of Count Bez\u00fakhov, a well-known grandee of Catherine\u2019s time who now lay dying in Moscow. The young man had not yet entered either the military or civil service, as he had only just returned from abroad where he had been educated, and this was his first appearance in society. Anna P\u00e1vlovna greeted him with the nod she accorded to the lowest hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety and fear, as at the sight of something too large and unsuited to the place, came over her face when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was certainly rather bigger than the other men in the room, her anxiety could only have reference to the clever though shy, but observant and natural, expression which distinguished him from everyone else in that drawing room.\n\n\u201cIt is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to come and visit a poor invalid,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her aunt as she conducted him to her.\n\nPierre murmured something unintelligible, and continued to look round as if in search of something. On his way to the aunt he bowed to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to an intimate acquaintance.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s alarm was justified, for Pierre turned away from the aunt without waiting to hear her speech about Her Majesty\u2019s health. Anna P\u00e1vlovna in dismay detained him with the words: \u201cDo you know the Abb\u00e9 Morio? He is a most interesting man.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I have heard of his scheme for perpetual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly feasible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou think so?\u201d rejoined Anna P\u00e1vlovna in order to say something and get away to attend to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now committed a reverse act of impoliteness. First he had left a lady before she had finished speaking to him, and now he continued to speak to another who wished to get away. With his head bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began explaining his reasons for thinking the abb\u00e9\u2019s plan chimerical.\n\n\u201cWe will talk of it later,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna with a smile.\n\nAnd having got rid of this young man who did not know how to behave, she resumed her duties as hostess and continued to listen and watch, ready to help at any point where the conversation might happen to flag. As the foreman of a spinning mill, when he has set the hands to work, goes round and notices here a spindle that has stopped or there one that creaks or makes more noise than it should, and hastens to check the machine or set it in proper motion, so Anna P\u00e1vlovna moved about her drawing room, approaching now a silent, now a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight rearrangement kept the conversational machine in steady, proper, and regular motion. But amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was evident. She kept an anxious watch on him when he approached the group round Mortemart to listen to what was being said there, and again when he passed to another group whose center was the abb\u00e9.\n\nPierre had been educated abroad, and this reception at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s was the first he had attended in Russia. He knew that all the intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not know which way to look, afraid of missing any clever conversation that was to be heard. Seeing the self-confident and refined expression on the faces of those present he was always expecting to hear something very profound. At last he came up to Morio. Here the conversation seemed interesting and he stood waiting for an opportunity to express his own views, as young people are fond of doing.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s reception was in full swing. The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who with her thin careworn face was rather out of place in this brilliant society, the whole company had settled into three groups. One, chiefly masculine, had formed round the abb\u00e9. Another, of young people, was grouped round the beautiful Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s daughter, and the little Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya, very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump for her age. The third group was gathered round Mortemart and Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nThe vicomte was a nice-looking young man with soft features and polished manners, who evidently considered himself a celebrity but out of politeness modestly placed himself at the disposal of the circle in which he found himself. Anna P\u00e1vlovna was obviously serving him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever ma\u00eetre d\u2019h\u00f4tel serves up as a specially choice delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, so Anna P\u00e1vlovna served up to her guests, first the vicomte and then the abb\u00e9, as peculiarly choice morsels. The group about Mortemart immediately began discussing the murder of the Duc d\u2019Enghien. The vicomte said that the Duc d\u2019Enghien had perished by his own magnanimity, and that there were particular reasons for Buonaparte\u2019s hatred of him.\n\n\u201cAh, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, with a pleasant feeling that there was something \u00e0 la Louis XV in the sound of that sentence: \u201cContez nous \u00e7ela, Vicomte.\u201d\n\nThe vicomte bowed and smiled courteously in token of his willingness to comply. Anna P\u00e1vlovna arranged a group round him, inviting everyone to listen to his tale.\n\n\u201cThe vicomte knew the duc personally,\u201d whispered Anna P\u00e1vlovna to one of the guests. \u201cThe vicomte is a wonderful raconteur,\u201d said she to another. \u201cHow evidently he belongs to the best society,\u201d said she to a third; and the vicomte was served up to the company in the choicest and most advantageous style, like a well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot dish.\n\nThe vicomte wished to begin his story and gave a subtle smile.\n\n\u201cCome over here, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, dear,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna to the beautiful young princess who was sitting some way off, the center of another group.\n\nThe princess smiled. She rose with the same unchanging smile with which she had first entered the room\u2014the smile of a perfectly beautiful woman. With a slight rustle of her white dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling diamonds, she passed between the men who made way for her, not looking at any of them but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing each the privilege of admiring her beautiful figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom\u2014which in the fashion of those days were very much exposed\u2014and she seemed to bring the glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved toward Anna P\u00e1vlovna. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was so lovely that not only did she not show any trace of coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared shy of her unquestionable and all too victorious beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be unable, to diminish its effect.\n\n\u201cHow lovely!\u201d said everyone who saw her; and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and dropped his eyes as if startled by something extraordinary when she took her seat opposite and beamed upon him also with her unchanging smile.\n\n\u201cMadame, I doubt my ability before such an audience,\u201d said he, smilingly inclining his head.\n\nThe princess rested her bare round arm on a little table and considered a reply unnecessary. She smilingly waited. All the time the story was being told she sat upright, glancing now at her beautiful round arm, altered in shape by its pressure on the table, now at her still more beautiful bosom, on which she readjusted a diamond necklace. From time to time she smoothed the folds of her dress, and whenever the story produced an effect she glanced at Anna P\u00e1vlovna, at once adopted just the expression she saw on the maid of honor\u2019s face, and again relapsed into her radiant smile.\n\nThe little princess had also left the tea table and followed H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\n\u201cWait a moment, I\u2019ll get my work.... Now then, what are you thinking of?\u201d she went on, turning to Prince Hippolyte. \u201cFetch me my workbag.\u201d\n\nThere was a general movement as the princess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in her seat.\n\n\u201cNow I am all right,\u201d she said, and asking the vicomte to begin, she took up her work.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, having brought the workbag, joined the circle and moving a chair close to hers seated himself beside her.\n\nLe charmant Hippolyte was surprising by his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His features were like his sister\u2019s, but while in her case everything was lit up by a joyous, self-satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of animation, and by the wonderful classic beauty of her figure, his face on the contrary was dulled by imbecility and a constant expression of sullen self-confidence, while his body was thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied grimace, and his arms and legs always fell into unnatural positions.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a ghost story?\u201d said he, sitting down beside the princess and hastily adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this instrument he could not begin to speak.\n\n\u201cWhy no, my dear fellow,\u201d said the astonished narrator, shrugging his shoulders.\n\n\u201cBecause I hate ghost stories,\u201d said Prince Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only understood the meaning of his words after he had uttered them.\n\nHe spoke with such self-confidence that his hearers could not be sure whether what he said was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of the color of cuisse de nymphe effray\u00e9e, as he called it, shoes, and silk stockings.\n\nThe vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was an anecdote, then current, to the effect that the Duc d\u2019Enghien had gone secretly to Paris to visit Mademoiselle George; that at her house he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed the famous actress\u2019 favors, and that in his presence Napoleon happened to fall into one of the fainting fits to which he was subject, and was thus at the duc\u2019s mercy. The latter spared him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subsequently repaid by death.\n\nThe story was very pretty and interesting, especially at the point where the rivals suddenly recognized one another; and the ladies looked agitated.\n\n\u201cCharming!\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna with an inquiring glance at the little princess.\n\n\u201cCharming!\u201d whispered the little princess, sticking the needle into her work as if to testify that the interest and fascination of the story prevented her from going on with it.\n\nThe vicomte appreciated this silent praise and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, but just then Anna P\u00e1vlovna, who had kept a watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed her, noticed that he was talking too loudly and vehemently with the abb\u00e9, so she hurried to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a conversation with the abb\u00e9 about the balance of power, and the latter, evidently interested by the young man\u2019s simple-minded eagerness, was explaining his pet theory. Both were talking and listening too eagerly and too naturally, which was why Anna P\u00e1vlovna disapproved.\n\n\u201cThe means are ... the balance of power in Europe and the rights of the people,\u201d the abb\u00e9 was saying. \u201cIt is only necessary for one powerful nation like Russia\u2014barbaric as she is said to be\u2014to place herself disinterestedly at the head of an alliance having for its object the maintenance of the balance of power of Europe, and it would save the world!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are you to get that balance?\u201d Pierre was beginning.\n\nAt that moment Anna P\u00e1vlovna came up and, looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian how he stood Russian climate. The Italian\u2019s face instantly changed and assumed an offensively affected, sugary expression, evidently habitual to him when conversing with women.\n\n\u201cI am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the wit and culture of the society, more especially of the feminine society, in which I have had the honor of being received, that I have not yet had time to think of the climate,\u201d said he.\n\nNot letting the abb\u00e9 and Pierre escape, Anna P\u00e1vlovna, the more conveniently to keep them under observation, brought them into the larger circle.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nJust then another visitor entered the drawing room: Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski, the little princess\u2019 husband. He was a very handsome young man, of medium height, with firm, clearcut features. Everything about him, from his weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured step, offered a most striking contrast to his quiet, little wife. It was evident that he not only knew everyone in the drawing room, but had found them to be so tiresome that it wearied him to look at or listen to them. And among all these faces that he found so tedious, none seemed to bore him so much as that of his pretty wife. He turned away from her with a grimace that distorted his handsome face, kissed Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s hand, and screwing up his eyes scanned the whole company.\n\n\u201cYou are off to the war, Prince?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\n\u201cGeneral Kut\u00fazov,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski, speaking French and stressing the last syllable of the general\u2019s name like a Frenchman, \u201chas been pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp....\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Lise, your wife?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe will go to the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you not ashamed to deprive us of your charming wife?\u201d\n\n\u201cAndr\u00e9,\u201d said his wife, addressing her husband in the same coquettish manner in which she spoke to other men, \u201cthe vicomte has been telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle George and Buonaparte!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew screwed up his eyes and turned away. Pierre, who from the moment Prince Andrew entered the room had watched him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up and took his arm. Before he looked round Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, but when he saw Pierre\u2019s beaming face he gave him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile.\n\n\u201cThere now!... So you, too, are in the great world?\u201d said he to Pierre.\n\n\u201cI knew you would be here,\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cI will come to supper with you. May I?\u201d he added in a low voice so as not to disturb the vicomte who was continuing his story.\n\n\u201cNo, impossible!\u201d said Prince Andrew, laughing and pressing Pierre\u2019s hand to show that there was no need to ask the question. He wished to say something more, but at that moment Prince Vas\u00edli and his daughter got up to go and the two young men rose to let them pass.\n\n\u201cYou must excuse me, dear Vicomte,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to the Frenchman, holding him down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent his rising. \u201cThis unfortunate fete at the ambassador\u2019s deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave your enchanting party,\u201d said he, turning to Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nHis daughter, Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, passed between the chairs, lightly holding up the folds of her dress, and the smile shone still more radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes as she passed him.\n\n\u201cVery lovely,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cVery,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nIn passing Prince Vas\u00edli seized Pierre\u2019s hand and said to Anna P\u00e1vlovna: \u201cEducate this bear for me! He has been staying with me a whole month and this is the first time I have seen him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a young man as the society of clever women.\u201d\n\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna smiled and promised to take Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be a connection of Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s. The elderly lady who had been sitting with the old aunt rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vas\u00edli in the anteroom. All the affectation of interest she had assumed had left her kindly and tear-worn face and it now expressed only anxiety and fear.\n\n\u201cHow about my son Bor\u00eds, Prince?\u201d said she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. \u201cI can\u2019t remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell me what news I may take back to my poor boy.\u201d\n\nAlthough Prince Vas\u00edli listened reluctantly and not very politely to the elderly lady, even betraying some impatience, she gave him an ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his hand that he might not go away.\n\n\u201cWhat would it cost you to say a word to the Emperor, and then he would be transferred to the Guards at once?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, Princess, I am ready to do all I can,\u201d answered Prince Vas\u00edli, \u201cbut it is difficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should advise you to appeal to Rumy\u00e1ntsev through Prince Gol\u00edtsyn. That would be the best way.\u201d\n\nThe elderly lady was a Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya, belonging to one of the best families in Russia, but she was poor, and having long been out of society had lost her former influential connections. She had now come to Petersburg to procure an appointment in the Guards for her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet Prince Vas\u00edli that she had obtained an invitation to Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s reception and had sat listening to the vicomte\u2019s story. Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s words frightened her, an embittered look clouded her once handsome face, but only for a moment; then she smiled again and clutched Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s arm more tightly.\n\n\u201cListen to me, Prince,\u201d said she. \u201cI have never yet asked you for anything and I never will again, nor have I ever reminded you of my father\u2019s friendship for you; but now I entreat you for God\u2019s sake to do this for my son\u2014and I shall always regard you as a benefactor,\u201d she added hurriedly. \u201cNo, don\u2019t be angry, but promise! I have asked Gol\u00edtsyn and he has refused. Be the kindhearted man you always were,\u201d she said, trying to smile though tears were in her eyes.\n\n\u201cPapa, we shall be late,\u201d said Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, turning her beautiful head and looking over her classically molded shoulder as she stood waiting by the door.\n\nInfluence in society, however, is a capital which has to be economized if it is to last. Prince Vas\u00edli knew this, and having once realized that if he asked on behalf of all who begged of him, he would soon be unable to ask for himself, he became chary of using his influence. But in Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya\u2019s case he felt, after her second appeal, something like qualms of conscience. She had reminded him of what was quite true; he had been indebted to her father for the first steps in his career. Moreover, he could see by her manners that she was one of those women\u2014mostly mothers\u2014who, having once made up their minds, will not rest until they have gained their end, and are prepared if necessary to go on insisting day after day and hour after hour, and even to make scenes. This last consideration moved him.\n\n\u201cMy dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna,\u201d said he with his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, \u201cit is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; but to prove my devotion to you and how I respect your father\u2019s memory, I will do the impossible\u2014your son shall be transferred to the Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satisfied?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear benefactor! This is what I expected from you\u2014I knew your kindness!\u201d He turned to go.\n\n\u201cWait\u2014just a word! When he has been transferred to the Guards...\u201d she faltered. \u201cYou are on good terms with Michael Ilari\u00f3novich Kut\u00fazov ... recommend Bor\u00eds to him as adjutant! Then I shall be at rest, and then...\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli smiled.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t promise that. You don\u2019t know how Kut\u00fazov is pestered since his appointment as Commander in Chief. He told me himself that all the Moscow ladies have conspired to give him all their sons as adjutants.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but do promise! I won\u2019t let you go! My dear benefactor...\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa,\u201d said his beautiful daughter in the same tone as before, \u201cwe shall be late.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen tomorrow you will speak to the Emperor?\u201d\n\n\u201cCertainly; but about Kut\u00fazov, I don\u2019t promise.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo promise, do promise, Vas\u00edli!\u201d cried Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as he went, with the smile of a coquettish girl, which at one time probably came naturally to her, but was now very ill-suited to her careworn face.\n\nApparently she had forgotten her age and by force of habit employed all the old feminine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone her face resumed its former cold, artificial expression. She returned to the group where the vicomte was still talking, and again pretended to listen, while waiting till it would be time to leave. Her task was accomplished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\u201cAnd what do you think of this latest comedy, the coronation at Milan?\u201d asked Anna P\u00e1vlovna, \u201cand of the comedy of the people of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is enough to make one\u2019s head whirl! It is as if the whole world had gone crazy.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew looked Anna P\u00e1vlovna straight in the face with a sarcastic smile.\n\n\u201c\u2018Dieu me la donne, gare \u00e0 qui la touche!\u2019\u2019 They say he was very fine when he said that,\u201d he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: \u201c\u2018Dio mi l\u2019ha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!\u2019\u2019\n\n\u201cI hope this will prove the last drop that will make the glass run over,\u201d Anna P\u00e1vlovna continued. \u201cThe sovereigns will not be able to endure this man who is a menace to everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia,\u201d said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: \u201cThe sovereigns, madame... What have they done for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame Elizabeth? Nothing!\u201d and he became more animated. \u201cAnd believe me, they are reaping the reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. The sovereigns! Why, they are sending ambassadors to compliment the usurper.\u201d\n\nAnd sighing disdainfully, he again changed his position.\n\nPrince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at the vicomte for some time through his lorgnette, suddenly turned completely round toward the little princess, and having asked for a needle began tracing the Cond\u00e9 coat of arms on the table. He explained this to her with as much gravity as if she had asked him to do it.\n\n\u201cB\u00e2ton de gueules, engr\u00eal\u00e9 de gueules d\u2019azur\u2014maison Cond\u00e9,\u201d said he.\n\nThe princess listened, smiling.\n\n\u201cIf Buonaparte remains on the throne of France a year longer,\u201d the vicomte continued, with the air of a man who, in a matter with which he is better acquainted than anyone else, does not listen to others but follows the current of his own thoughts, \u201cthings will have gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and executions, French society\u2014I mean good French society\u2014will have been forever destroyed, and then....\u201d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders and spread out his hands. Pierre wished to make a remark, for the conversation interested him, but Anna P\u00e1vlovna, who had him under observation, interrupted:\n\n\u201cThe Emperor Alexander,\u201d said she, with the melancholy which always accompanied any reference of hers to the Imperial family, \u201chas declared that he will leave it to the French people themselves to choose their own form of government; and I believe that once free from the usurper, the whole nation will certainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful king,\u201d she concluded, trying to be amiable to the royalist emigrant.\n\n\u201cThat is doubtful,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cMonsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes that matters have already gone too far. I think it will be difficult to return to the old regime.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom what I have heard,\u201d said Pierre, blushing and breaking into the conversation, \u201calmost all the aristocracy has already gone over to Bonaparte\u2019s side.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is the Buonapartists who say that,\u201d replied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. \u201cAt the present time it is difficult to know the real state of French public opinion.\u201d\n\n\u201cBonaparte has said so,\u201d remarked Prince Andrew with a sarcastic smile.\n\nIt was evident that he did not like the vicomte and was aiming his remarks at him, though without looking at him.\n\n\u201c\u2018I showed them the path to glory, but they did not follow it,\u2019\u201d Prince Andrew continued after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon\u2019s words. \u201c\u2018I opened my antechambers and they crowded in.\u2019 I do not know how far he was justified in saying so.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot in the least,\u201d replied the vicomte. \u201cAfter the murder of the duc even the most partial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some people,\u201d he went on, turning to Anna P\u00e1vlovna, \u201che ever was a hero, after the murder of the duc there was one martyr more in heaven and one hero less on earth.\u201d\n\nBefore Anna P\u00e1vlovna and the others had time to smile their appreciation of the vicomte\u2019s epigram, Pierre again broke into the conversation, and though Anna P\u00e1vlovna felt sure he would say something inappropriate, she was unable to stop him.\n\n\u201cThe execution of the Duc d\u2019Enghien,\u201d declared Monsieur Pierre, \u201cwas a political necessity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed greatness of soul by not fearing to take on himself the whole responsibility of that deed.\u201d\n\n\u201cDieu! Mon Dieu!\u201d muttered Anna P\u00e1vlovna in a terrified whisper.\n\n\u201cWhat, Monsieur Pierre... Do you consider that assassination shows greatness of soul?\u201d said the little princess, smiling and drawing her work nearer to her.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh!\u201d exclaimed several voices.\n\n\u201cCapital!\u201d said Prince Hippolyte in English, and began slapping his knee with the palm of his hand.\n\nThe vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over his spectacles and continued.\n\n\u201cI say so,\u201d he continued desperately, \u201cbecause the Bourbons fled from the Revolution leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon alone understood the Revolution and quelled it, and so for the general good, he could not stop short for the sake of one man\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cWon\u2019t you come over to the other table?\u201d suggested Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nBut Pierre continued his speech without heeding her.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d cried he, becoming more and more eager, \u201cNapoleon is great because he rose superior to the Revolution, suppressed its abuses, preserved all that was good in it\u2014equality of citizenship and freedom of speech and of the press\u2014and only for that reason did he obtain power.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, if having obtained power, without availing himself of it to commit murder he had restored it to the rightful king, I should have called him a great man,\u201d remarked the vicomte.\n\n\u201cHe could not do that. The people only gave him power that he might rid them of the Bourbons and because they saw that he was a great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!\u201d continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this desperate and provocative proposition his extreme youth and his wish to express all that was in his mind.\n\n\u201cWhat? Revolution and regicide a grand thing?... Well, after that... But won\u2019t you come to this other table?\u201d repeated Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\n\u201cRousseau\u2019s Contrat Social,\u201d said the vicomte with a tolerant smile.\n\n\u201cI am not speaking of regicide, I am speaking about ideas.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regicide,\u201d again interjected an ironical voice.\n\n\u201cThose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.\u201d\n\n\u201cLiberty and equality,\u201d said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, \u201chigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew kept looking with an amused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first moment of Pierre\u2019s outburst Anna P\u00e1vlovna, despite her social experience, was horror-struck. But when she saw that Pierre\u2019s sacrilegious words had not exasperated the vicomte, and had convinced herself that it was impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on the orator.\n\n\u201cBut, my dear Monsieur Pierre,\u201d said she, \u201chow do you explain the fact of a great man executing a duc\u2014or even an ordinary man who\u2014is innocent and untried?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should like,\u201d said the vicomte, \u201cto ask how monsieur explains the 18th Brumaire; was not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and not at all like the conduct of a great man!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the prisoners he killed in Africa? That was horrible!\u201d said the little princess, shrugging her shoulders.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a low fellow, say what you will,\u201d remarked Prince Hippolyte.\n\nPierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked at them all and smiled. His smile was unlike the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instantaneously replaced by another\u2014a childlike, kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to ask forgiveness.\n\nThe vicomte who was meeting him for the first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin was not so terrible as his words suggested. All were silent.\n\n\u201cHow do you expect him to answer you all at once?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cBesides, in the actions of a statesman one has to distinguish between his acts as a private person, as a general, and as an emperor. So it seems to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, of course!\u201d Pierre chimed in, pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement.\n\n\u201cOne must admit,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cthat Napoleon as a man was great on the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague-stricken; but ... but there are other acts which it is difficult to justify.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had evidently wished to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre\u2019s remarks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it was time to go.\n\nSuddenly Prince Hippolyte started up making signs to everyone to attend, and asking them all to be seated began:\n\n\u201cI was told a charming Moscow story today and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte\u2014I must tell it in Russian or the point will be lost....\u201d And Prince Hippolyte began to tell his story in such Russian as a Frenchman would speak after spending about a year in Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and eagerly did he demand their attention to his story.\n\n\u201cThere is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and she is very stingy. She must have two footmen behind her carriage, and very big ones. That was her taste. And she had a lady\u2019s maid, also big. She said....\u201d\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently collecting his ideas with difficulty.\n\n\u201cShe said.... Oh yes! She said, \u2018Girl,\u2019 to the maid, \u2018put on a livery, get up behind the carriage, and come with me while I make some calls.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere Prince Hippolyte spluttered and burst out laughing long before his audience, which produced an effect unfavorable to the narrator. Several persons, among them the elderly lady and Anna P\u00e1vlovna, did however smile.\n\n\u201cShe went. Suddenly there was a great wind. The girl lost her hat and her long hair came down....\u201d Here he could contain himself no longer and went on, between gasps of laughter: \u201cAnd the whole world knew....\u201d\n\nAnd so the anecdote ended. Though it was unintelligible why he had told it, or why it had to be told in Russian, still Anna P\u00e1vlovna and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte\u2019s social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre\u2019s unpleasant and unamiable outburst. After the anecdote the conversation broke up into insignificant small talk about the last and next balls, about theatricals, and who would meet whom, and when and where.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nHaving thanked Anna P\u00e1vlovna for her charming soiree, the guests began to take their leave.\n\nPierre was ungainly. Stout, about the average height, broad, with huge red hands; he did not know, as the saying is, how to enter a drawing room and still less how to leave one; that is, how to say something particularly agreeable before going away. Besides this he was absent-minded. When he rose to go, he took up instead of his own, the general\u2019s three-cornered hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the general asked him to restore it. All his absent-mindedness and inability to enter a room and converse in it was, however, redeemed by his kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna P\u00e1vlovna turned toward him and, with a Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness of his indiscretion, nodded and said: \u201cI hope to see you again, but I also hope you will change your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre.\u201d\n\nWhen she said this, he did not reply and only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, which said nothing, unless perhaps, \u201cOpinions are opinions, but you see what a capital, good-natured fellow I am.\u201d And everyone, including Anna P\u00e1vlovna, felt this.\n\nPrince Andrew had gone out into the hall, and, turning his shoulders to the footman who was helping him on with his cloak, listened indifferently to his wife\u2019s chatter with Prince Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at her through his eyeglass.\n\n\u201cGo in, Annette, or you will catch cold,\u201d said the little princess, taking leave of Anna P\u00e1vlovna. \u201cIt is settled,\u201d she added in a low voice.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna had already managed to speak to Lise about the match she contemplated between Anatole and the little princess\u2019 sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cI rely on you, my dear,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, also in a low tone. \u201cWrite to her and let me know how her father looks at the matter. Au revoir! \u201d\u2014and she left the hall.\n\nPrince Hippolyte approached the little princess and, bending his face close to her, began to whisper something.\n\nTwo footmen, the princess\u2019 and his own, stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for the conversation to finish. They listened to the French sentences which to them were meaningless, with an air of understanding but not wishing to appear to do so. The princess as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI am very glad I did not go to the ambassador\u2019s,\u201d said Prince Hippolyte \u201c\u2014so dull\u2014. It has been a delightful evening, has it not? Delightful!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say the ball will be very good,\u201d replied the princess, drawing up her downy little lip. \u201cAll the pretty women in society will be there.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot all, for you will not be there; not all,\u201d said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and snatching the shawl from the footman, whom he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it round the princess. Either from awkwardness or intentionally (no one could have said which) after the shawl had been adjusted he kept his arm around her for a long time, as though embracing her.\n\nStill smiling, she gracefully moved away, turning and glancing at her husband. Prince Andrew\u2019s eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy did he seem.\n\n\u201cAre you ready?\u201d he asked his wife, looking past her.\n\nPrince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, which in the latest fashion reached to his very heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the porch following the princess, whom a footman was helping into the carriage.\n\n\u201cPrincesse, au revoir,\u201d cried he, stumbling with his tongue as well as with his feet.\n\nThe princess, picking up her dress, was taking her seat in the dark carriage, her husband was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, under pretense of helping, was in everyone\u2019s way.\n\n\u201cAllow me, sir,\u201d said Prince Andrew in Russian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince Hippolyte who was blocking his path.\n\n\u201cI am expecting you, Pierre,\u201d said the same voice, but gently and affectionately.\n\nThe postilion started, the carriage wheels rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmodically as he stood in the porch waiting for the vicomte whom he had promised to take home.\n\n\u201cWell, mon cher,\u201d said the vicomte, having seated himself beside Hippolyte in the carriage, \u201cyour little princess is very nice, very nice indeed, quite French,\u201d and he kissed the tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cDo you know, you are a terrible chap for all your innocent airs,\u201d continued the vicomte. \u201cI pity the poor husband, that little officer who gives himself the airs of a monarch.\u201d\n\nHippolyte spluttered again, and amid his laughter said, \u201cAnd you were saying that the Russian ladies are not equal to the French? One has to know how to deal with them.\u201d\n\nPierre reaching the house first went into Prince Andrew\u2019s study like one quite at home, and from habit immediately lay down on the sofa, took from the shelf the first book that came to his hand (it was Caesar\u2019s Commentaries), and resting on his elbow, began reading it in the middle.\n\n\u201cWhat have you done to Mlle Sch\u00e9rer? She will be quite ill now,\u201d said Prince Andrew, as he entered the study, rubbing his small white hands.\n\nPierre turned his whole body, making the sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand.\n\n\u201cThat abb\u00e9 is very interesting but he does not see the thing in the right light.... In my opinion perpetual peace is possible but\u2014I do not know how to express it ... not by a balance of political power....\u201d\n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew was not interested in such abstract conversation.\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t everywhere say all one thinks, mon cher. Well, have you at last decided on anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or a diplomatist?\u201d asked Prince Andrew after a momentary silence.\n\nPierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs tucked under him.\n\n\u201cReally, I don\u2019t yet know. I don\u2019t like either the one or the other.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you must decide on something! Your father expects it.\u201d\n\nPierre at the age of ten had been sent abroad with an abb\u00e9 as tutor, and had remained away till he was twenty. When he returned to Moscow his father dismissed the abb\u00e9 and said to the young man, \u201cNow go to Petersburg, look round, and choose your profession. I will agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince Vas\u00edli, and here is money. Write to me all about it, and I will help you in everything.\u201d Pierre had already been choosing a career for three months, and had not decided on anything. It was about this choice that Prince Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his forehead.\n\n\u201cBut he must be a Freemason,\u201d said he, referring to the abb\u00e9 whom he had met that evening.\n\n\u201cThat is all nonsense.\u201d Prince Andrew again interrupted him, \u201clet us talk business. Have you been to the Horse Guards?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I have not; but this is what I have been thinking and wanted to tell you. There is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a war for freedom I could understand it and should be the first to enter the army; but to help England and Austria against the greatest man in the world is not right.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders at Pierre\u2019s childish words. He put on the air of one who finds it impossible to reply to such nonsense, but it would in fact have been difficult to give any other answer than the one Prince Andrew gave to this na\u00efve question.\n\n\u201cIf no one fought except on his own conviction, there would be no wars,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd that would be splendid,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled ironically.\n\n\u201cVery likely it would be splendid, but it will never come about....\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, why are you going to the war?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhat for? I don\u2019t know. I must. Besides that I am going....\u201d He paused. \u201cI am going because the life I am leading here does not suit me!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe rustle of a woman\u2019s dress was heard in the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself as if waking up, and his face assumed the look it had had in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s drawing room. Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The princess came in. She had changed her gown for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed a chair for her.\n\n\u201cHow is it,\u201d she began, as usual in French, settling down briskly and fussily in the easy chair, \u201chow is it Annette never got married? How stupid you men all are not to have married her! Excuse me for saying so, but you have no sense about women. What an argumentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I am still arguing with your husband. I can\u2019t understand why he wants to go to the war,\u201d replied Pierre, addressing the princess with none of the embarrassment so commonly shown by young men in their intercourse with young women.\n\nThe princess started. Evidently Pierre\u2019s words touched her to the quick.\n\n\u201cAh, that is just what I tell him!\u201d said she. \u201cI don\u2019t understand it; I don\u2019t in the least understand why men can\u2019t live without wars. How is it that we women don\u2019t want anything of the kind, don\u2019t need it? Now you shall judge between us. I always tell him: Here he is Uncle\u2019s aide-de-camp, a most brilliant position. He is so well known, so much appreciated by everyone. The other day at the Apr\u00e1ksins\u2019 I heard a lady asking, \u2018Is that the famous Prince Andrew?\u2019 I did indeed.\u201d She laughed. \u201cHe is so well received everywhere. He might easily become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You know the Emperor spoke to him most graciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to arrange it. What do you think?\u201d\n\nPierre looked at his friend and, noticing that he did not like the conversation, gave no reply.\n\n\u201cWhen are you starting?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t speak of his going, don\u2019t! I won\u2019t hear it spoken of,\u201d said the princess in the same petulantly playful tone in which she had spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and which was so plainly ill-suited to the family circle of which Pierre was almost a member. \u201cToday when I remembered that all these delightful associations must be broken off ... and then you know, Andr\u00e9...\u201d (she looked significantly at her husband) \u201cI\u2019m afraid, I\u2019m afraid!\u201d she whispered, and a shudder ran down her back.\n\nHer husband looked at her as if surprised to notice that someone besides Pierre and himself was in the room, and addressed her in a tone of frigid politeness.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don\u2019t understand,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cThere, what egotists men all are: all, all egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up alone in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith my father and sister, remember,\u201d said Prince Andrew gently.\n\n\u201cAlone all the same, without my friends.... And he expects me not to be afraid.\u201d\n\nHer tone was now querulous and her lip drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an animal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if she felt it indecorous to speak of her pregnancy before Pierre, though the gist of the matter lay in that.\n\n\u201cI still can\u2019t understand what you are afraid of,\u201d said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his eyes off his wife.\n\nThe princess blushed, and raised her arms with a gesture of despair.\n\n\u201cNo, Andrew, I must say you have changed. Oh, how you have....\u201d\n\n\u201cYour doctor tells you to go to bed earlier,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cYou had better go.\u201d\n\nThe princess said nothing, but suddenly her short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the room.\n\nPierre looked over his spectacles with na\u00efve surprise, now at him and now at her, moved as if about to rise too, but changed his mind.\n\n\u201cWhy should I mind Monsieur Pierre being here?\u201d exclaimed the little princess suddenly, her pretty face all at once distorted by a tearful grimace. \u201cI have long wanted to ask you, Andrew, why you have changed so to me? What have I done to you? You are going to the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cLise!\u201d was all Prince Andrew said. But that one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and above all conviction that she would herself regret her words. But she went on hurriedly:\n\n\u201cYou treat me like an invalid or a child. I see it all! Did you behave like that six months ago?\u201d\n\n\u201cLise, I beg you to desist,\u201d said Prince Andrew still more emphatically.\n\nPierre, who had been growing more and more agitated as he listened to all this, rose and approached the princess. He seemed unable to bear the sight of tears and was ready to cry himself.\n\n\u201cCalm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you because.... I assure you I myself have experienced ... and so ... because ... No, excuse me! An outsider is out of place here.... No, don\u2019t distress yourself.... Good-by!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew caught him by the hand.\n\n\u201cNo, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spending the evening with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he thinks only of himself,\u201d muttered the princess without restraining her angry tears.\n\n\u201cLise!\u201d said Prince Andrew dryly, raising his voice to the pitch which indicates that patience is exhausted.\n\nSuddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression of the princess\u2019 pretty face changed into a winning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful eyes glanced askance at her husband\u2019s face, and her own assumed the timid, deprecating expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly wags its drooping tail.\n\n\u201cMon Dieu, mon Dieu!\u201d she muttered, and lifting her dress with one hand she went up to her husband and kissed him on the forehead.\n\n\u201cGood night, Lise,\u201d said he, rising and courteously kissing her hand as he would have done to a stranger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe friends were silent. Neither cared to begin talking. Pierre continually glanced at Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his forehead with his small hand.\n\n\u201cLet us go and have supper,\u201d he said with a sigh, going to the door.\n\nThey entered the elegant, newly decorated, and luxurious dining room. Everything from the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass bore that imprint of newness found in the households of the newly married. Halfway through supper Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the table and, with a look of nervous agitation such as Pierre had never before seen on his face, began to talk\u2014as one who has long had something on his mind and suddenly determines to speak out.\n\n\u201cNever, never marry, my dear fellow! That\u2019s my advice: never marry till you can say to yourself that you have done all you are capable of, and until you have ceased to love the woman of your choice and have seen her plainly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old and good for nothing\u2014or all that is good and noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don\u2019t look at me with such surprise. If you marry expecting anything from yourself in the future, you will feel at every step that for you all is ended, all is closed except the drawing room, where you will be ranged side by side with a court lackey and an idiot!... But what\u2019s the good?...\u201d and he waved his arm.\n\nPierre took off his spectacles, which made his face seem different and the good-natured expression still more apparent, and gazed at his friend in amazement.\n\n\u201cMy wife,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cis an excellent woman, one of those rare women with whom a man\u2019s honor is safe; but, O God, what would I not give now to be unmarried! You are the first and only one to whom I mention this, because I like you.\u201d\n\nAs he said this Prince Andrew was less than ever like that Bolk\u00f3nski who had lolled in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s easy chairs and with half-closed eyes had uttered French phrases between his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face was now quivering with nervous excitement; his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed at ordinary times, the more impassioned he became in these moments of almost morbid irritation.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand why I say this,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it is the whole story of life. You talk of Bonaparte and his career,\u201d said he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bonaparte), \u201cbut Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but his aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality\u2014these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from. I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cand at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s they listen to me. And that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women.... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything\u2014that\u2019s what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there\u2019s nothing, nothing, nothing! No, don\u2019t marry, my dear fellow; don\u2019t marry!\u201d concluded Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cIt seems funny to me,\u201d said Pierre, \u201cthat you, you should consider yourself incapable and your life a spoiled life. You have everything before you, everything. And you....\u201d\n\nHe did not finish his sentence, but his tone showed how highly he thought of his friend and how much he expected of him in the future.\n\n\u201cHow can he talk like that?\u201d thought Pierre. He considered his friend a model of perfection because Prince Andrew possessed in the highest degree just the very qualities Pierre lacked, and which might be best described as strength of will. Pierre was always astonished at Prince Andrew\u2019s calm manner of treating everybody, his extraordinary memory, his extensive reading (he had read everything, knew everything, and had an opinion about everything), but above all at his capacity for work and study. And if Pierre was often struck by Andrew\u2019s lack of capacity for philosophical meditation (to which he himself was particularly addicted), he regarded even this not as a defect but as a sign of strength.\n\nEven in the best, most friendly and simplest relations of life, praise and commendation are essential, just as grease is necessary to wheels that they may run smoothly.\n\n\u201cMy part is played out,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of talking about me? Let us talk about you,\u201d he added after a silence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts.\n\nThat smile was immediately reflected on Pierre\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cBut what is there to say about me?\u201d said Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry smile. \u201cWhat am I? An illegitimate son!\u201d He suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that he had made a great effort to say this. \u201cWithout a name and without means... And it really...\u201d But he did not say what \u201cit really\u201d was. \u201cFor the present I am free and am all right. Only I haven\u2019t the least idea what I am to do; I wanted to consult you seriously.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet his glance\u2014friendly and affectionate as it was\u2014expressed a sense of his own superiority.\n\n\u201cI am fond of you, especially as you are the one live man among our whole set. Yes, you\u2019re all right! Choose what you will; it\u2019s all the same. You\u2019ll be all right anywhere. But look here: give up visiting those Kur\u00e1gins and leading that sort of life. It suits you so badly\u2014all this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat would you have, my dear fellow?\u201d answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. \u201cWomen, my dear fellow; women!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand it,\u201d replied Prince Andrew. \u201cWomen who are comme il faut, that\u2019s a different matter; but the Kur\u00e1gins\u2019 set of women, \u2018women and wine\u2019 I don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nPierre was staying at Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s and sharing the dissipated life of his son Anatole, the son whom they were planning to reform by marrying him to Prince Andrew\u2019s sister.\n\n\u201cDo you know?\u201d said Pierre, as if suddenly struck by a happy thought, \u201cseriously, I have long been thinking of it.... Leading such a life I can\u2019t decide or think properly about anything. One\u2019s head aches, and one spends all one\u2019s money. He asked me for tonight, but I won\u2019t go.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou give me your word of honor not to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn my honor!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was past one o\u2019clock when Pierre left his friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer night. Pierre took an open cab intending to drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to the house the more he felt the impossibility of going to sleep on such a night. It was light enough to see a long way in the deserted street and it seemed more like morning or evening than night. On the way Pierre remembered that Anatole Kur\u00e1gin was expecting the usual set for cards that evening, after which there was generally a drinking bout, finishing with visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of.\n\n\u201cI should like to go to Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s,\u201d thought he.\n\nBut he immediately recalled his promise to Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as happens to people of weak character, he desired so passionately once more to enjoy that dissipation he was so accustomed to that he decided to go. The thought immediately occurred to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was of no account, because before he gave it he had already promised Prince Anatole to come to his gathering; \u201cbesides,\u201d thought he, \u201call such \u2018words of honor\u2019 are conventional things with no definite meaning, especially if one considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, or something so extraordinary may happen to one that honor and dishonor will be all the same!\u201d Pierre often indulged in reflections of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and intentions. He went to Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s.\n\nReaching the large house near the Horse Guards\u2019 barracks, in which Anatole lived, Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended the stairs, and went in at the open door. There was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices and shouting in the distance.\n\nCards and supper were over, but the visitors had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his cloak and entered the first room, in which were the remains of supper. A footman, thinking no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what was left in the glasses. From the third room came sounds of laughter, the shouting of familiar voices, the growling of a bear, and general commotion. Some eight or nine young men were crowding anxiously round an open window. Three others were romping with a young bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying to set him at the others.\n\n\u201cI bet a hundred on Stevens!\u201d shouted one.\n\n\u201cMind, no holding on!\u201d cried another.\n\n\u201cI bet on D\u00f3lokhov!\u201d cried a third. \u201cKur\u00e1gin, you part our hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, leave Bruin alone; here\u2019s a bet on.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt one draught, or he loses!\u201d shouted a fourth.\n\n\u201cJacob, bring a bottle!\u201d shouted the host, a tall, handsome fellow who stood in the midst of the group, without a coat, and with his fine linen shirt unfastened in front. \u201cWait a bit, you fellows.... Here is P\u00e9tya! Good man!\u201d cried he, addressing Pierre.\n\nAnother voice, from a man of medium height with clear blue eyes, particularly striking among all these drunken voices by its sober ring, cried from the window: \u201cCome here; part the bets!\u201d This was D\u00f3lokhov, an officer of the Sem\u00ebnov regiment, a notorious gambler and duelist, who was living with Anatole. Pierre smiled, looking about him merrily.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. What\u2019s it all about?\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a bit, he is not drunk yet! A bottle here,\u201d said Anatole, and taking a glass from the table he went up to Pierre.\n\n\u201cFirst of all you must drink!\u201d\n\nPierre drank one glass after another, looking from under his brows at the tipsy guests who were again crowding round the window, and listening to their chatter. Anatole kept on refilling Pierre\u2019s glass while explaining that D\u00f3lokhov was betting with Stevens, an English naval officer, that he would drink a bottle of rum sitting on the outer ledge of the third floor window with his legs hanging out.\n\n\u201cGo on, you must drink it all,\u201d said Anatole, giving Pierre the last glass, \u201cor I won\u2019t let you go!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t,\u201d said Pierre, pushing Anatole aside, and he went up to the window.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov was holding the Englishman\u2019s hand and clearly and distinctly repeating the terms of the bet, addressing himself particularly to Anatole and Pierre.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov was of medium height, with curly hair and light-blue eyes. He was about twenty-five. Like all infantry officers he wore no mustache, so that his mouth, the most striking feature of his face, was clearly seen. The lines of that mouth were remarkably finely curved. The middle of the upper lip formed a sharp wedge and closed firmly on the firm lower one, and something like two distinct smiles played continually round the two corners of the mouth; this, together with the resolute, insolent intelligence of his eyes, produced an effect which made it impossible not to notice his face. D\u00f3lokhov was a man of small means and no connections. Yet, though Anatole spent tens of thousands of rubles, D\u00f3lokhov lived with him and had placed himself on such a footing that all who knew them, including Anatole himself, respected him more than they did Anatole. D\u00f3lokhov could play all games and nearly always won. However much he drank, he never lost his clearheadedness. Both Kur\u00e1gin and D\u00f3lokhov were at that time notorious among the rakes and scapegraces of Petersburg.\n\nThe bottle of rum was brought. The window frame which prevented anyone from sitting on the outer sill was being forced out by two footmen, who were evidently flurried and intimidated by the directions and shouts of the gentlemen around.\n\nAnatole with his swaggering air strode up to the window. He wanted to smash something. Pushing away the footmen he tugged at the frame, but could not move it. He smashed a pane.\n\n\u201cYou have a try, Hercules,\u201d said he, turning to Pierre.\n\nPierre seized the crossbeam, tugged, and wrenched the oak frame out with a crash.\n\n\u201cTake it right out, or they\u2019ll think I\u2019m holding on,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cIs the Englishman bragging?... Eh? Is it all right?\u201d said Anatole.\n\n\u201cFirst-rate,\u201d said Pierre, looking at D\u00f3lokhov, who with a bottle of rum in his hand was approaching the window, from which the light of the sky, the dawn merging with the afterglow of sunset, was visible.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov, the bottle of rum still in his hand, jumped onto the window sill. \u201cListen!\u201d cried he, standing there and addressing those in the room. All were silent.\n\n\u201cI bet fifty imperials\u201d\u2014he spoke French that the Englishman might understand him, but he did not speak it very well\u2014\u201cI bet fifty imperials ... or do you wish to make it a hundred?\u201d added he, addressing the Englishman.\n\n\u201cNo, fifty,\u201d replied the latter.\n\n\u201cAll right. Fifty imperials ... that I will drink a whole bottle of rum without taking it from my mouth, sitting outside the window on this spot\u201d (he stooped and pointed to the sloping ledge outside the window) \u201cand without holding on to anything. Is that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite right,\u201d said the Englishman.\n\nAnatole turned to the Englishman and taking him by one of the buttons of his coat and looking down at him\u2014the Englishman was short\u2014began repeating the terms of the wager to him in English.\n\n\u201cWait!\u201d cried D\u00f3lokhov, hammering with the bottle on the window sill to attract attention. \u201cWait a bit, Kur\u00e1gin. Listen! If anyone else does the same, I will pay him a hundred imperials. Do you understand?\u201d\n\nThe Englishman nodded, but gave no indication whether he intended to accept this challenge or not. Anatole did not release him, and though he kept nodding to show that he understood, Anatole went on translating D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s words into English. A thin young lad, an hussar of the Life Guards, who had been losing that evening, climbed on the window sill, leaned over, and looked down.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh! Oh!\u201d he muttered, looking down from the window at the stones of the pavement.\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d cried D\u00f3lokhov, pushing him away from the window. The lad jumped awkwardly back into the room, tripping over his spurs.\n\nPlacing the bottle on the window sill where he could reach it easily, D\u00f3lokhov climbed carefully and slowly through the window and lowered his legs. Pressing against both sides of the window, he adjusted himself on his seat, lowered his hands, moved a little to the right and then to the left, and took up the bottle. Anatole brought two candles and placed them on the window sill, though it was already quite light. D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s back in his white shirt, and his curly head, were lit up from both sides. Everyone crowded to the window, the Englishman in front. Pierre stood smiling but silent. One man, older than the others present, suddenly pushed forward with a scared and angry look and wanted to seize hold of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s shirt.\n\n\u201cI say, this is folly! He\u2019ll be killed,\u201d said this more sensible man.\n\nAnatole stopped him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch him! You\u2019ll startle him and then he\u2019ll be killed. Eh?... What then?... Eh?\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov turned round and, again holding on with both hands, arranged himself on his seat.\n\n\u201cIf anyone comes meddling again,\u201d said he, emitting the words separately through his thin compressed lips, \u201cI will throw him down there. Now then!\u201d\n\nSaying this he again turned round, dropped his hands, took the bottle and lifted it to his lips, threw back his head, and raised his free hand to balance himself. One of the footmen who had stooped to pick up some broken glass remained in that position without taking his eyes from the window and from D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s back. Anatole stood erect with staring eyes. The Englishman looked on sideways, pursing up his lips. The man who had wished to stop the affair ran to a corner of the room and threw himself on a sofa with his face to the wall. Pierre hid his face, from which a faint smile forgot to fade though his features now expressed horror and fear. All were still. Pierre took his hands from his eyes. D\u00f3lokhov still sat in the same position, only his head was thrown further back till his curly hair touched his shirt collar, and the hand holding the bottle was lifted higher and higher and trembled with the effort. The bottle was emptying perceptibly and rising still higher and his head tilting yet further back. \u201cWhy is it so long?\u201d thought Pierre. It seemed to him that more than half an hour had elapsed. Suddenly D\u00f3lokhov made a backward movement with his spine, and his arm trembled nervously; this was sufficient to cause his whole body to slip as he sat on the sloping ledge. As he began slipping down, his head and arm wavered still more with the strain. One hand moved as if to clutch the window sill, but refrained from touching it. Pierre again covered his eyes and thought he would never open them again. Suddenly he was aware of a stir all around. He looked up: D\u00f3lokhov was standing on the window sill, with a pale but radiant face.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s empty.\u201d\n\nHe threw the bottle to the Englishman, who caught it neatly. D\u00f3lokhov jumped down. He smelt strongly of rum.\n\n\u201cWell done!... Fine fellow!... There\u2019s a bet for you!... Devil take you!\u201d came from different sides.\n\nThe Englishman took out his purse and began counting out the money. D\u00f3lokhov stood frowning and did not speak. Pierre jumped upon the window sill.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, who wishes to bet with me? I\u2019ll do the same thing!\u201d he suddenly cried. \u201cEven without a bet, there! Tell them to bring me a bottle. I\u2019ll do it.... Bring a bottle!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet him do it, let him do it,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, smiling.\n\n\u201cWhat next? Have you gone mad?... No one would let you!... Why, you go giddy even on a staircase,\u201d exclaimed several voices.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll drink it! Let\u2019s have a bottle of rum!\u201d shouted Pierre, banging the table with a determined and drunken gesture and preparing to climb out of the window.\n\nThey seized him by his arms; but he was so strong that everyone who touched him was sent flying.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019ll never manage him that way,\u201d said Anatole. \u201cWait a bit and I\u2019ll get round him.... Listen! I\u2019ll take your bet tomorrow, but now we are all going to \u2014\u2014\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome on then,\u201d cried Pierre. \u201cCome on!... And we\u2019ll take Bruin with us.\u201d\n\nAnd he caught the bear, took it in his arms, lifted it from the ground, and began dancing round the room with it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli kept the promise he had given to Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya who had spoken to him on behalf of her only son Bor\u00eds on the evening of Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s soiree. The matter was mentioned to the Emperor, an exception made, and Bor\u00eds transferred into the regiment of Sem\u00ebnov Guards with the rank of cornet. He received, however, no appointment to Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff despite all Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s endeavors and entreaties. Soon after Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s reception Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna returned to Moscow and went straight to her rich relations, the Rost\u00f3vs, with whom she stayed when in the town and where her darling B\u00f3ry, who had only just entered a regiment of the line and was being at once transferred to the Guards as a cornet, had been educated from childhood and lived for years at a time. The Guards had already left Petersburg on the tenth of August, and her son, who had remained in Moscow for his equipment, was to join them on the march to Radziv\u00edlov.\n\nIt was St. Natalia\u2019s day and the name day of two of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2014the mother and the youngest daughter\u2014both named Nataly. Ever since the morning, carriages with six horses had been coming and going continually, bringing visitors to the Countess Rost\u00f3va\u2019s big house on the Povarsk\u00e1ya, so well known to all Moscow. The countess herself and her handsome eldest daughter were in the drawing room with the visitors who came to congratulate, and who constantly succeeded one another in relays.\n\nThe countess was a woman of about forty-five, with a thin Oriental type of face, evidently worn out with childbearing\u2014she had had twelve. A languor of motion and speech, resulting from weakness, gave her a distinguished air which inspired respect. Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna Drubetsk\u00e1ya, who as a member of the household was also seated in the drawing room, helped to receive and entertain the visitors. The young people were in one of the inner rooms, not considering it necessary to take part in receiving the visitors. The count met the guests and saw them off, inviting them all to dinner.\n\n\u201cI am very, very grateful to you, mon cher,\u201d or \u201cma ch\u00e8re\u201d\u2014he called everyone without exception and without the slightest variation in his tone, \u201cmy dear,\u201d whether they were above or below him in rank\u2014\u201cI thank you for myself and for our two dear ones whose name day we are keeping. But mind you come to dinner or I shall be offended, ma ch\u00e8re! On behalf of the whole family I beg you to come, mon cher!\u201d These words he repeated to everyone without exception or variation, and with the same expression on his full, cheerful, clean-shaven face, the same firm pressure of the hand and the same quick, repeated bows. As soon as he had seen a visitor off he returned to one of those who were still in the drawing room, drew a chair toward him or her, and jauntily spreading out his legs and putting his hands on his knees with the air of a man who enjoys life and knows how to live, he swayed to and fro with dignity, offered surmises about the weather, or touched on questions of health, sometimes in Russian and sometimes in very bad but self-confident French; then again, like a man weary but unflinching in the fulfillment of duty, he rose to see some visitors off and, stroking his scanty gray hairs over his bald patch, also asked them to dinner. Sometimes on his way back from the anteroom he would pass through the conservatory and pantry into the large marble dining hall, where tables were being set out for eighty people; and looking at the footmen, who were bringing in silver and china, moving tables, and unfolding damask table linen, he would call Dm\u00edtri Vas\u00edlevich, a man of good family and the manager of all his affairs, and while looking with pleasure at the enormous table would say: \u201cWell, Dm\u00edtri, you\u2019ll see that things are all as they should be? That\u2019s right! The great thing is the serving, that\u2019s it.\u201d And with a complacent sigh he would return to the drawing room.\n\n\u201cM\u00e1rya Lv\u00f3vna Kar\u00e1gina and her daughter!\u201d announced the countess\u2019 gigantic footman in his bass voice, entering the drawing room. The countess reflected a moment and took a pinch from a gold snuffbox with her husband\u2019s portrait on it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m quite worn out by these callers. However, I\u2019ll see her and no more. She is so affected. Ask her in,\u201d she said to the footman in a sad voice, as if saying: \u201cVery well, finish me off.\u201d\n\nA tall, stout, and proud-looking woman, with a round-faced smiling daughter, entered the drawing room, their dresses rustling.\n\n\u201cDear Countess, what an age... She has been laid up, poor child ... at the Razum\u00f3vski\u2019s ball ... and Countess Apr\u00e1ksina ... I was so delighted...\u201d came the sounds of animated feminine voices, interrupting one another and mingling with the rustling of dresses and the scraping of chairs. Then one of those conversations began which last out until, at the first pause, the guests rise with a rustle of dresses and say, \u201cI am so delighted... Mamma\u2019s health... and Countess Apr\u00e1ksina...\u201d and then, again rustling, pass into the anteroom, put on cloaks or mantles, and drive away. The conversation was on the chief topic of the day: the illness of the wealthy and celebrated beau of Catherine\u2019s day, Count Bez\u00fakhov, and about his illegitimate son Pierre, the one who had behaved so improperly at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s reception.\n\n\u201cI am so sorry for the poor count,\u201d said the visitor. \u201cHe is in such bad health, and now this vexation about his son is enough to kill him!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that?\u201d asked the countess as if she did not know what the visitor alluded to, though she had already heard about the cause of Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s distress some fifteen times.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what comes of a modern education,\u201d exclaimed the visitor. \u201cIt seems that while he was abroad this young man was allowed to do as he liked, now in Petersburg I hear he has been doing such terrible things that he has been expelled by the police.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t say so!\u201d replied the countess.\n\n\u201cHe chose his friends badly,\u201d interposed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cPrince Vas\u00edli\u2019s son, he, and a certain D\u00f3lokhov have, it is said, been up to heaven only knows what! And they have had to suffer for it. D\u00f3lokhov has been degraded to the ranks and Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s son sent back to Moscow. Anatole Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s father managed somehow to get his son\u2019s affair hushed up, but even he was ordered out of Petersburg.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what have they been up to?\u201d asked the countess.\n\n\u201cThey are regular brigands, especially D\u00f3lokhov,\u201d replied the visitor. \u201cHe is a son of M\u00e1rya Iv\u00e1novna D\u00f3lokhova, such a worthy woman, but there, just fancy! Those three got hold of a bear somewhere, put it in a carriage, and set off with it to visit some actresses! The police tried to interfere, and what did the young men do? They tied a policeman and the bear back to back and put the bear into the Moyka Canal. And there was the bear swimming about with the policeman on his back!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a nice figure the policeman must have cut, my dear!\u201d shouted the count, dying with laughter.\n\n\u201cOh, how dreadful! How can you laugh at it, Count?\u201d\n\nYet the ladies themselves could not help laughing.\n\n\u201cIt was all they could do to rescue the poor man,\u201d continued the visitor. \u201cAnd to think it is Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s son who amuses himself in this sensible manner! And he was said to be so well educated and clever. This is all that his foreign education has done for him! I hope that here in Moscow no one will receive him, in spite of his money. They wanted to introduce him to me, but I quite declined: I have my daughters to consider.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you say this young man is so rich?\u201d asked the countess, turning away from the girls, who at once assumed an air of inattention. \u201cHis children are all illegitimate. I think Pierre also is illegitimate.\u201d\n\nThe visitor made a gesture with her hand.\n\n\u201cI should think he has a score of them.\u201d\n\nPrincess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna intervened in the conversation, evidently wishing to show her connections and knowledge of what went on in society.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is,\u201d said she significantly, and also in a half whisper, \u201ceveryone knows Count Cyril\u2019s reputation.... He has lost count of his children, but this Pierre was his favorite.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow handsome the old man still was only a year ago!\u201d remarked the countess. \u201cI have never seen a handsomer man.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is very much altered now,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cWell, as I was saying, Prince Vas\u00edli is the next heir through his wife, but the count is very fond of Pierre, looked after his education, and wrote to the Emperor about him; so that in the case of his death\u2014and he is so ill that he may die at any moment, and Dr. Lorrain has come from Petersburg\u2014no one knows who will inherit his immense fortune, Pierre or Prince Vas\u00edli. Forty thousand serfs and millions of rubles! I know it all very well for Prince Vas\u00edli told me himself. Besides, Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich is my mother\u2019s second cousin. He\u2019s also my B\u00f3ry\u2019s godfather,\u201d she added, as if she attached no importance at all to the fact.\n\n\u201cPrince Vas\u00edli arrived in Moscow yesterday. I hear he has come on some inspection business,\u201d remarked the visitor.\n\n\u201cYes, but between ourselves,\u201d said the princess, \u201cthat is a pretext. The fact is he has come to see Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich, hearing how ill he is.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut do you know, my dear, that was a capital joke,\u201d said the count; and seeing that the elder visitor was not listening, he turned to the young ladies. \u201cI can just imagine what a funny figure that policeman cut!\u201d\n\nAnd as he waved his arms to impersonate the policeman, his portly form again shook with a deep ringing laugh, the laugh of one who always eats well and, in particular, drinks well. \u201cSo do come and dine with us!\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nSilence ensued. The countess looked at her callers, smiling affably, but not concealing the fact that she would not be distressed if they now rose and took their leave. The visitor\u2019s daughter was already smoothing down her dress with an inquiring look at her mother, when suddenly from the next room were heard the footsteps of boys and girls running to the door and the noise of a chair falling over, and a girl of thirteen, hiding something in the folds of her short muslin frock, darted in and stopped short in the middle of the room. It was evident that she had not intended her flight to bring her so far. Behind her in the doorway appeared a student with a crimson coat collar, an officer of the Guards, a girl of fifteen, and a plump rosy-faced boy in a short jacket.\n\nThe count jumped up and, swaying from side to side, spread his arms wide and threw them round the little girl who had run in.\n\n\u201cAh, here she is!\u201d he exclaimed laughing. \u201cMy pet, whose name day it is. My dear pet!\u201d\n\n\u201cMa ch\u00e8re, there is a time for everything,\u201d said the countess with feigned severity. \u201cYou spoil her, Ily\u00e1,\u201d she added, turning to her husband.\n\n\u201cHow do you do, my dear? I wish you many happy returns of your name day,\u201d said the visitor. \u201cWhat a charming child,\u201d she added, addressing the mother.\n\nThis black-eyed, wide-mouthed girl, not pretty but full of life\u2014with childish bare shoulders which after her run heaved and shook her bodice, with black curls tossed backward, thin bare arms, little legs in lace-frilled drawers, and feet in low slippers\u2014was just at that charming age when a girl is no longer a child, though the child is not yet a young woman. Escaping from her father she ran to hide her flushed face in the lace of her mother\u2019s mantilla\u2014not paying the least attention to her severe remark\u2014and began to laugh. She laughed, and in fragmentary sentences tried to explain about a doll which she produced from the folds of her frock.\n\n\u201cDo you see?... My doll... Mimi... You see...\u201d was all Nat\u00e1sha managed to utter (to her everything seemed funny). She leaned against her mother and burst into such a loud, ringing fit of laughter that even the prim visitor could not help joining in.\n\n\u201cNow then, go away and take your monstrosity with you,\u201d said the mother, pushing away her daughter with pretended sternness, and turning to the visitor she added: \u201cShe is my youngest girl.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha, raising her face for a moment from her mother\u2019s mantilla, glanced up at her through tears of laughter, and again hid her face.\n\nThe visitor, compelled to look on at this family scene, thought it necessary to take some part in it.\n\n\u201cTell me, my dear,\u201d said she to Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cis Mimi a relation of yours? A daughter, I suppose?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not like the visitor\u2019s tone of condescension to childish things. She did not reply, but looked at her seriously.\n\nMeanwhile the younger generation: Bor\u00eds, the officer, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s son; Nicholas, the undergraduate, the count\u2019s eldest son; S\u00f3nya, the count\u2019s fifteen-year-old niece, and little P\u00e9tya, his youngest boy, had all settled down in the drawing room and were obviously trying to restrain within the bounds of decorum the excitement and mirth that shone in all their faces. Evidently in the back rooms, from which they had dashed out so impetuously, the conversation had been more amusing than the drawing room talk of society scandals, the weather, and Countess Apr\u00e1ksina. Now and then they glanced at one another, hardly able to suppress their laughter.\n\nThe two young men, the student and the officer, friends from childhood, were of the same age and both handsome fellows, though not alike. Bor\u00eds was tall and fair, and his calm and handsome face had regular, delicate features. Nicholas was short with curly hair and an open expression. Dark hairs were already showing on his upper lip, and his whole face expressed impetuosity and enthusiasm. Nicholas blushed when he entered the drawing room. He evidently tried to find something to say, but failed. Bor\u00eds on the contrary at once found his footing, and related quietly and humorously how he had known that doll Mimi when she was still quite a young lady, before her nose was broken; how she had aged during the five years he had known her, and how her head had cracked right across the skull. Having said this he glanced at Nat\u00e1sha. She turned away from him and glanced at her younger brother, who was screwing up his eyes and shaking with suppressed laughter, and unable to control herself any longer, she jumped up and rushed from the room as fast as her nimble little feet would carry her. Bor\u00eds did not laugh.\n\n\u201cYou were meaning to go out, weren\u2019t you, Mamma? Do you want the carriage?\u201d he asked his mother with a smile.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, go and tell them to get it ready,\u201d she answered, returning his smile.\n\nBor\u00eds quietly left the room and went in search of Nat\u00e1sha. The plump boy ran after them angrily, as if vexed that their program had been disturbed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe only young people remaining in the drawing room, not counting the young lady visitor and the countess\u2019 eldest daughter (who was four years older than her sister and behaved already like a grown-up person), were Nicholas and S\u00f3nya, the niece. S\u00f3nya was a slender little brunette with a tender look in her eyes which were veiled by long lashes, thick black plaits coiling twice round her head, and a tawny tint in her complexion and especially in the color of her slender but graceful and muscular arms and neck. By the grace of her movements, by the softness and flexibility of her small limbs, and by a certain coyness and reserve of manner, she reminded one of a pretty, half-grown kitten which promises to become a beautiful little cat. She evidently considered it proper to show an interest in the general conversation by smiling, but in spite of herself her eyes under their thick long lashes watched her cousin who was going to join the army, with such passionate girlish adoration that her smile could not for a single instant impose upon anyone, and it was clear that the kitten had settled down only to spring up with more energy and again play with her cousin as soon as they too could, like Nat\u00e1sha and Bor\u00eds, escape from the drawing room.\n\n\u201cAh yes, my dear,\u201d said the count, addressing the visitor and pointing to Nicholas, \u201chis friend Bor\u00eds has become an officer, and so for friendship\u2019s sake he is leaving the university and me, his old father, and entering the military service, my dear. And there was a place and everything waiting for him in the Archives Department! Isn\u2019t that friendship?\u201d remarked the count in an inquiring tone.\n\n\u201cBut they say that war has been declared,\u201d replied the visitor.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been saying so a long while,\u201d said the count, \u201cand they\u2019ll say so again and again, and that will be the end of it. My dear, there\u2019s friendship for you,\u201d he repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s joining the hussars.\u201d\n\nThe visitor, not knowing what to say, shook her head.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not at all from friendship,\u201d declared Nicholas, flaring up and turning away as if from a shameful aspersion. \u201cIt is not from friendship at all; I simply feel that the army is my vocation.\u201d\n\nHe glanced at his cousin and the young lady visitor; and they were both regarding him with a smile of approbation.\n\n\u201cSchubert, the colonel of the P\u00e1vlograd Hussars, is dining with us today. He has been here on leave and is taking Nicholas back with him. It can\u2019t be helped!\u201d said the count, shrugging his shoulders and speaking playfully of a matter that evidently distressed him.\n\n\u201cI have already told you, Papa,\u201d said his son, \u201cthat if you don\u2019t wish to let me go, I\u2019ll stay. But I know I am no use anywhere except in the army; I am not a diplomat or a government clerk.\u2014I don\u2019t know how to hide what I feel.\u201d As he spoke he kept glancing with the flirtatiousness of a handsome youth at S\u00f3nya and the young lady visitor.\n\nThe little kitten, feasting her eyes on him, seemed ready at any moment to start her gambols again and display her kittenish nature.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d said the old count. \u201cHe always flares up! This Buonaparte has turned all their heads; they all think of how he rose from an ensign and became Emperor. Well, well, God grant it,\u201d he added, not noticing his visitor\u2019s sarcastic smile.\n\nThe elders began talking about Bonaparte. Julie Kar\u00e1gina turned to young Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWhat a pity you weren\u2019t at the Arkh\u00e1rovs\u2019 on Thursday. It was so dull without you,\u201d said she, giving him a tender smile.\n\nThe young man, flattered, sat down nearer to her with a coquettish smile, and engaged the smiling Julie in a confidential conversation without at all noticing that his involuntary smile had stabbed the heart of S\u00f3nya, who blushed and smiled unnaturally. In the midst of his talk he glanced round at her. She gave him a passionately angry glance, and hardly able to restrain her tears and maintain the artificial smile on her lips, she got up and left the room. All Nicholas\u2019 animation vanished. He waited for the first pause in the conversation, and then with a distressed face left the room to find S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cHow plainly all these young people wear their hearts on their sleeves!\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, pointing to Nicholas as he went out. \u201cCousinage\u2014dangereux voisinage,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said the countess when the brightness these young people had brought into the room had vanished; and as if answering a question no one had put but which was always in her mind, \u201cand how much suffering, how much anxiety one has had to go through that we might rejoice in them now! And yet really the anxiety is greater now than the joy. One is always, always anxious! Especially just at this age, so dangerous both for girls and boys.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt all depends on the bringing up,\u201d remarked the visitor.\n\n\u201cYes, you\u2019re quite right,\u201d continued the countess. \u201cTill now I have always, thank God, been my children\u2019s friend and had their full confidence,\u201d said she, repeating the mistake of so many parents who imagine that their children have no secrets from them. \u201cI know I shall always be my daughters\u2019 first confidante, and that if Nicholas, with his impulsive nature, does get into mischief (a boy can\u2019t help it), he will all the same never be like those Petersburg young men.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they are splendid, splendid youngsters,\u201d chimed in the count, who always solved questions that seemed to him perplexing by deciding that everything was splendid. \u201cJust fancy: wants to be an hussar. What\u2019s one to do, my dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a charming creature your younger girl is,\u201d said the visitor; \u201ca little volcano!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, a regular volcano,\u201d said the count. \u201cTakes after me! And what a voice she has; though she\u2019s my daughter, I tell the truth when I say she\u2019ll be a singer, a second Salomoni! We have engaged an Italian to give her lessons.\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she too young? I have heard that it harms the voice to train it at that age.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, not at all too young!\u201d replied the count. \u201cWhy, our mothers used to be married at twelve or thirteen.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd she\u2019s in love with Bor\u00eds already. Just fancy!\u201d said the countess with a gentle smile, looking at Bor\u00eds and went on, evidently concerned with a thought that always occupied her: \u201cNow you see if I were to be severe with her and to forbid it ... goodness knows what they might be up to on the sly\u201d (she meant that they would be kissing), \u201cbut as it is, I know every word she utters. She will come running to me of her ow", "sequence": 0}, {"offset": 100000, "text": "n accord in the evening and tell me everything. Perhaps I spoil her, but really that seems the best plan. With her elder sister I was stricter.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I was brought up quite differently,\u201d remarked the handsome elder daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, with a smile.\n\nBut the smile did not enhance V\u00e9ra\u2019s beauty as smiles generally do; on the contrary it gave her an unnatural, and therefore unpleasant, expression. V\u00e9ra was good-looking, not at all stupid, quick at learning, was well brought up, and had a pleasant voice; what she said was true and appropriate, yet, strange to say, everyone\u2014the visitors and countess alike\u2014turned to look at her as if wondering why she had said it, and they all felt awkward.\n\n\u201cPeople are always too clever with their eldest children and try to make something exceptional of them,\u201d said the visitor.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of denying it, my dear? Our dear countess was too clever with V\u00e9ra,\u201d said the count. \u201cWell, what of that? She\u2019s turned out splendidly all the same,\u201d he added, winking at V\u00e9ra.\n\nThe guests got up and took their leave, promising to return to dinner.\n\n\u201cWhat manners! I thought they would never go,\u201d said the countess, when she had seen her guests out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWhen Nat\u00e1sha ran out of the drawing room she only went as far as the conservatory. There she paused and stood listening to the conversation in the drawing room, waiting for Bor\u00eds to come out. She was already growing impatient, and stamped her foot, ready to cry at his not coming at once, when she heard the young man\u2019s discreet steps approaching neither quickly nor slowly. At this Nat\u00e1sha dashed swiftly among the flower tubs and hid there.\n\nBor\u00eds paused in the middle of the room, looked round, brushed a little dust from the sleeve of his uniform, and going up to a mirror examined his handsome face. Nat\u00e1sha, very still, peered out from her ambush, waiting to see what he would do. He stood a little while before the glass, smiled, and walked toward the other door. Nat\u00e1sha was about to call him but changed her mind. \u201cLet him look for me,\u201d thought she. Hardly had Bor\u00eds gone than S\u00f3nya, flushed, in tears, and muttering angrily, came in at the other door. Nat\u00e1sha checked her first impulse to run out to her, and remained in her hiding place, watching\u2014as under an invisible cap\u2014to see what went on in the world. She was experiencing a new and peculiar pleasure. S\u00f3nya, muttering to herself, kept looking round toward the drawing room door. It opened and Nicholas came in.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, what is the matter with you? How can you?\u201d said he, running up to her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, nothing; leave me alone!\u201d sobbed S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cAh, I know what it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, if you do, so much the better, and you can go back to her!\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00f3-o-onya! Look here! How can you torture me and yourself like that, for a mere fancy?\u201d said Nicholas taking her hand.\n\nS\u00f3nya did not pull it away, and left off crying. Nat\u00e1sha, not stirring and scarcely breathing, watched from her ambush with sparkling eyes. \u201cWhat will happen now?\u201d thought she.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya! What is anyone in the world to me? You alone are everything!\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cAnd I will prove it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like you to talk like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, I won\u2019t; only forgive me, S\u00f3nya!\u201d He drew her to him and kissed her.\n\n\u201cOh, how nice,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha; and when S\u00f3nya and Nicholas had gone out of the conservatory she followed and called Bor\u00eds to her.\n\n\u201cBor\u00eds, come here,\u201d said she with a sly and significant look. \u201cI have something to tell you. Here, here!\u201d and she led him into the conservatory to the place among the tubs where she had been hiding.\n\nBor\u00eds followed her, smiling.\n\n\u201cWhat is the something?\u201d asked he.\n\nShe grew confused, glanced round, and, seeing the doll she had thrown down on one of the tubs, picked it up.\n\n\u201cKiss the doll,\u201d said she.\n\nBor\u00eds looked attentively and kindly at her eager face, but did not reply.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you want to? Well, then, come here,\u201d said she, and went further in among the plants and threw down the doll. \u201cCloser, closer!\u201d she whispered.\n\nShe caught the young officer by his cuffs, and a look of solemnity and fear appeared on her flushed face.\n\n\u201cAnd me? Would you like to kiss me?\u201d she whispered almost inaudibly, glancing up at him from under her brows, smiling, and almost crying from excitement.\n\nBor\u00eds blushed.\n\n\u201cHow funny you are!\u201d he said, bending down to her and blushing still more, but he waited and did nothing.\n\nSuddenly she jumped up onto a tub to be higher than he, embraced him so that both her slender bare arms clasped him above his neck, and, tossing back her hair, kissed him full on the lips.\n\nThen she slipped down among the flowerpots on the other side of the tubs and stood, hanging her head.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha,\u201d he said, \u201cyou know that I love you, but....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are in love with me?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha broke in.\n\n\u201cYes, I am, but please don\u2019t let us do like that.... In another four years ... then I will ask for your hand.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha considered.\n\n\u201cThirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,\u201d she counted on her slender little fingers. \u201cAll right! Then it\u2019s settled?\u201d\n\nA smile of joy and satisfaction lit up her eager face.\n\n\u201cSettled!\u201d replied Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cForever?\u201d said the little girl. \u201cTill death itself?\u201d\n\nShe took his arm and with a happy face went with him into the adjoining sitting room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAfter receiving her visitors, the countess was so tired that she gave orders to admit no more, but the porter was told to be sure to invite to dinner all who came \u201cto congratulate.\u201d The countess wished to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate talk with the friend of her childhood, Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, whom she had not seen properly since she returned from Petersburg. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with her tear-worn but pleasant face, drew her chair nearer to that of the countess.\n\n\u201cWith you I will be quite frank,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cThere are not many left of us old friends! That\u2019s why I so value your friendship.\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna looked at V\u00e9ra and paused. The countess pressed her friend\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cV\u00e9ra,\u201d she said to her eldest daughter who was evidently not a favorite, \u201chow is it you have so little tact? Don\u2019t you see you are not wanted here? Go to the other girls, or...\u201d\n\nThe handsome V\u00e9ra smiled contemptuously but did not seem at all hurt.\n\n\u201cIf you had told me sooner, Mamma, I would have gone,\u201d she replied as she rose to go to her own room.\n\nBut as she passed the sitting room she noticed two couples sitting, one pair at each window. She stopped and smiled scornfully. S\u00f3nya was sitting close to Nicholas who was copying out some verses for her, the first he had ever written. Bor\u00eds and Nat\u00e1sha were at the other window and ceased talking when V\u00e9ra entered. S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha looked at V\u00e9ra with guilty, happy faces.\n\nIt was pleasant and touching to see these little girls in love; but apparently the sight of them roused no pleasant feeling in V\u00e9ra.\n\n\u201cHow often have I asked you not to take my things?\u201d she said. \u201cYou have a room of your own,\u201d and she took the inkstand from Nicholas.\n\n\u201cIn a minute, in a minute,\u201d he said, dipping his pen.\n\n\u201cYou always manage to do things at the wrong time,\u201d continued V\u00e9ra. \u201cYou came rushing into the drawing room so that everyone felt ashamed of you.\u201d\n\nThough what she said was quite just, perhaps for that very reason no one replied, and the four simply looked at one another. She lingered in the room with the inkstand in her hand.\n\n\u201cAnd at your age what secrets can there be between Nat\u00e1sha and Bor\u00eds, or between you two? It\u2019s all nonsense!\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, V\u00e9ra, what does it matter to you?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha in defense, speaking very gently.\n\nShe seemed that day to be more than ever kind and affectionate to everyone.\n\n\u201cVery silly,\u201d said V\u00e9ra. \u201cI am ashamed of you. Secrets indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll have secrets of their own,\u201d answered Nat\u00e1sha, getting warmer. \u201cWe don\u2019t interfere with you and Berg.\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think not,\u201d said V\u00e9ra, \u201cbecause there can never be anything wrong in my behavior. But I\u2019ll just tell Mamma how you are behaving with Bor\u00eds.\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1lya Ilyn\u00edchna behaves very well to me,\u201d remarked Bor\u00eds. \u201cI have nothing to complain of.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Bor\u00eds! You are such a diplomat that it is really tiresome,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha in a mortified voice that trembled slightly. (She used the word \u201cdiplomat,\u201d which was just then much in vogue among the children, in the special sense they attached to it.) \u201cWhy does she bother me?\u201d And she added, turning to V\u00e9ra, \u201cYou\u2019ll never understand it, because you\u2019ve never loved anyone. You have no heart! You are a Madame de Genlis and nothing more\u201d (this nickname, bestowed on V\u00e9ra by Nicholas, was considered very stinging), \u201cand your greatest pleasure is to be unpleasant to people! Go and flirt with Berg as much as you please,\u201d she finished quickly.\n\n\u201cI shall at any rate not run after a young man before visitors...\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, now you\u2019ve done what you wanted,\u201d put in Nicholas\u2014\u201csaid unpleasant things to everyone and upset them. Let\u2019s go to the nursery.\u201d\n\nAll four, like a flock of scared birds, got up and left the room.\n\n\u201cThe unpleasant things were said to me,\u201d remarked V\u00e9ra, \u201cI said none to anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cMadame de Genlis! Madame de Genlis!\u201d shouted laughing voices through the door.\n\nThe handsome V\u00e9ra, who produced such an irritating and unpleasant effect on everyone, smiled and, evidently unmoved by what had been said to her, went to the looking glass and arranged her hair and scarf. Looking at her own handsome face she seemed to become still colder and calmer.\n\n\nIn the drawing room the conversation was still going on.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear,\u201d said the countess, \u201cmy life is not all roses either. Don\u2019t I know that at the rate we are living our means won\u2019t last long? It\u2019s all the Club and his easygoing nature. Even in the country do we get any rest? Theatricals, hunting, and heaven knows what besides! But don\u2019t let\u2019s talk about me; tell me how you managed everything. I often wonder at you, Annette\u2014how at your age you can rush off alone in a carriage to Moscow, to Petersburg, to those ministers and great people, and know how to deal with them all! It\u2019s quite astonishing. How did you get things settled? I couldn\u2019t possibly do it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my love,\u201d answered Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, \u201cGod grant you never know what it is to be left a widow without means and with a son you love to distraction! One learns many things then,\u201d she added with a certain pride. \u201cThat lawsuit taught me much. When I want to see one of those big people I write a note: \u2018Princess So-and-So desires an interview with So and-So,\u2019 and then I take a cab and go myself two, three, or four times\u2014till I get what I want. I don\u2019t mind what they think of me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and to whom did you apply about B\u00f3ry?\u201d asked the countess. \u201cYou see yours is already an officer in the Guards, while my Nicholas is going as a cadet. There\u2019s no one to interest himself for him. To whom did you apply?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo Prince Vas\u00edli. He was so kind. He at once agreed to everything, and put the matter before the Emperor,\u201d said Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna enthusiastically, quite forgetting all the humiliation she had endured to gain her end.\n\n\u201cHas Prince Vas\u00edli aged much?\u201d asked the countess. \u201cI have not seen him since we acted together at the Rumy\u00e1ntsovs\u2019 theatricals. I expect he has forgotten me. He paid me attentions in those days,\u201d said the countess, with a smile.\n\n\u201cHe is just the same as ever,\u201d replied Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, \u201coverflowing with amiability. His position has not turned his head at all. He said to me, \u2018I am sorry I can do so little for you, dear Princess. I am at your command.\u2019 Yes, he is a fine fellow and a very kind relation. But, Nataly, you know my love for my son: I would do anything for his happiness! And my affairs are in such a bad way that my position is now a terrible one,\u201d continued Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, sadly, dropping her voice. \u201cMy wretched lawsuit takes all I have and makes no progress. Would you believe it, I have literally not a penny and don\u2019t know how to equip Bor\u00eds.\u201d She took out her handkerchief and began to cry. \u201cI need five hundred rubles, and have only one twenty-five-ruble note. I am in such a state.... My only hope now is in Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov. If he will not assist his godson\u2014you know he is B\u00f3ry\u2019s godfather\u2014and allow him something for his maintenance, all my trouble will have been thrown away.... I shall not be able to equip him.\u201d\n\nThe countess\u2019 eyes filled with tears and she pondered in silence.\n\n\u201cI often think, though, perhaps it\u2019s a sin,\u201d said the princess, \u201cthat here lives Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov so rich, all alone... that tremendous fortune... and what is his life worth? It\u2019s a burden to him, and B\u00f3ry\u2019s life is only just beginning....\u201d\n\n\u201cSurely he will leave something to Bor\u00eds,\u201d said the countess.\n\n\u201cHeaven only knows, my dear! These rich grandees are so selfish. Still, I will take Bor\u00eds and go to see him at once, and I shall speak to him straight out. Let people think what they will of me, it\u2019s really all the same to me when my son\u2019s fate is at stake.\u201d The princess rose. \u201cIt\u2019s now two o\u2019clock and you dine at four. There will just be time.\u201d\n\nAnd like a practical Petersburg lady who knows how to make the most of time, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna sent someone to call her son, and went into the anteroom with him.\n\n\u201cGood-by, my dear,\u201d said she to the countess who saw her to the door, and added in a whisper so that her son should not hear, \u201cWish me good luck.\u201d\n\n\u201cAre you going to Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich, my dear?\u201d said the count coming out from the dining hall into the anteroom, and he added: \u201cIf he is better, ask Pierre to dine with us. He has been to the house, you know, and danced with the children. Be sure to invite him, my dear. We will see how Tar\u00e1s distinguishes himself today. He says Count Orl\u00f3v never gave such a dinner as ours will be!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\n\u201cMy dear Bor\u00eds,\u201d said Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna to her son as Countess Rost\u00f3va\u2019s carriage in which they were seated drove over the straw covered street and turned into the wide courtyard of Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s house. \u201cMy dear Bor\u00eds,\u201d said the mother, drawing her hand from beneath her old mantle and laying it timidly and tenderly on her son\u2019s arm, \u201cbe affectionate and attentive to him. Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich is your godfather after all, and your future depends on him. Remember that, my dear, and be nice to him, as you so well know how to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only I knew that anything besides humiliation would come of it...\u201d answered her son coldly. \u201cBut I have promised and will do it for your sake.\u201d\n\nAlthough the hall porter saw someone\u2019s carriage standing at the entrance, after scrutinizing the mother and son (who without asking to be announced had passed straight through the glass porch between the rows of statues in niches) and looking significantly at the lady\u2019s old cloak, he asked whether they wanted the count or the princesses, and, hearing that they wished to see the count, said his excellency was worse today, and that his excellency was not receiving anyone.\n\n\u201cWe may as well go back,\u201d said the son in French.\n\n\u201cMy dear!\u201d exclaimed his mother imploringly, again laying her hand on his arm as if that touch might soothe or rouse him.\n\nBor\u00eds said no more, but looked inquiringly at his mother without taking off his cloak.\n\n\u201cMy friend,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna in gentle tones, addressing the hall porter, \u201cI know Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich is very ill... that\u2019s why I have come... I am a relation. I shall not disturb him, my friend... I only need see Prince Vas\u00edli Serg\u00e9evich: he is staying here, is he not? Please announce me.\u201d\n\nThe hall porter sullenly pulled a bell that rang upstairs, and turned away.\n\n\u201cPrincess Drubetsk\u00e1ya to see Prince Vas\u00edli Serg\u00e9evich,\u201d he called to a footman dressed in knee breeches, shoes, and a swallow-tail coat, who ran downstairs and looked over from the halfway landing.\n\nThe mother smoothed the folds of her dyed silk dress before a large Venetian mirror in the wall, and in her trodden-down shoes briskly ascended the carpeted stairs.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d she said to her son, once more stimulating him by a touch, \u201cyou promised me!\u201d\n\nThe son, lowering his eyes, followed her quietly.\n\nThey entered the large hall, from which one of the doors led to the apartments assigned to Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\nJust as the mother and son, having reached the middle of the hall, were about to ask their way of an elderly footman who had sprung up as they entered, the bronze handle of one of the doors turned and Prince Vas\u00edli came out\u2014wearing a velvet coat with a single star on his breast, as was his custom when at home\u2014taking leave of a good-looking, dark-haired man. This was the celebrated Petersburg doctor, Lorrain.\n\n\u201cThen it is certain?\u201d said the prince.\n\n\u201cPrince, humanum est errare, but...\u201d replied the doctor, swallowing his r\u2019s, and pronouncing the Latin words with a French accent.\n\n\u201cVery well, very well...\u201d\n\nSeeing Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and her son, Prince Vas\u00edli dismissed the doctor with a bow and approached them silently and with a look of inquiry. The son noticed that an expression of profound sorrow suddenly clouded his mother\u2019s face, and he smiled slightly.\n\n\u201cAh, Prince! In what sad circumstances we meet again! And how is our dear invalid?\u201d said she, as though unaware of the cold offensive look fixed on her.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli stared at her and at Bor\u00eds questioningly and perplexed. Bor\u00eds bowed politely. Prince Vas\u00edli without acknowledging the bow turned to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, answering her query by a movement of the head and lips indicating very little hope for the patient.\n\n\u201cIs it possible?\u201d exclaimed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cOh, how awful! It is terrible to think.... This is my son,\u201d she added, indicating Bor\u00eds. \u201cHe wanted to thank you himself.\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds bowed again politely.\n\n\u201cBelieve me, Prince, a mother\u2019s heart will never forget what you have done for us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad I was able to do you a service, my dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli, arranging his lace frill, and in tone and manner, here in Moscow to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna whom he had placed under an obligation, assuming an air of much greater importance than he had done in Petersburg at Anna Sch\u00e9rer\u2019s reception.\n\n\u201cTry to serve well and show yourself worthy,\u201d added he, addressing Bor\u00eds with severity. \u201cI am glad.... Are you here on leave?\u201d he went on in his usual tone of indifference.\n\n\u201cI am awaiting orders to join my new regiment, your excellency,\u201d replied Bor\u00eds, betraying neither annoyance at the prince\u2019s brusque manner nor a desire to enter into conversation, but speaking so quietly and respectfully that the prince gave him a searching glance.\n\n\u201cAre you living with your mother?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am living at Countess Rost\u00f3va\u2019s,\u201d replied Bor\u00eds, again adding, \u201cyour excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is, with Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v who married Nataly Shinshin\u00e1,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna.\n\n\u201cI know, I know,\u201d answered Prince Vas\u00edli in his monotonous voice. \u201cI never could understand how Nataly made up her mind to marry that unlicked bear! A perfectly absurd and stupid fellow, and a gambler too, I am told.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut a very kind man, Prince,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a pathetic smile, as though she too knew that Count Rost\u00f3v deserved this censure, but asked him not to be too hard on the poor old man. \u201cWhat do the doctors say?\u201d asked the princess after a pause, her worn face again expressing deep sorrow.\n\n\u201cThey give little hope,\u201d replied the prince.\n\n\u201cAnd I should so like to thank Uncle once for all his kindness to me and Bor\u00eds. He is his godson,\u201d she added, her tone suggesting that this fact ought to give Prince Vas\u00edli much satisfaction.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli became thoughtful and frowned. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna saw that he was afraid of finding in her a rival for Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s fortune, and hastened to reassure him.\n\n\u201cIf it were not for my sincere affection and devotion to Uncle,\u201d said she, uttering the word with peculiar assurance and unconcern, \u201cI know his character: noble, upright ... but you see he has no one with him except the young princesses.... They are still young....\u201d She bent her head and continued in a whisper: \u201cHas he performed his final duty, Prince? How priceless are those last moments! It can make things no worse, and it is absolutely necessary to prepare him if he is so ill. We women, Prince,\u201d and she smiled tenderly, \u201calways know how to say these things. I absolutely must see him, however painful it may be for me. I am used to suffering.\u201d\n\nEvidently the prince understood her, and also understood, as he had done at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s, that it would be difficult to get rid of Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna.\n\n\u201cWould not such a meeting be too trying for him, dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna?\u201d said he. \u201cLet us wait until evening. The doctors are expecting a crisis.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut one cannot delay, Prince, at such a moment! Consider that the welfare of his soul is at stake. Ah, it is awful: the duties of a Christian...\u201d\n\nA door of one of the inner rooms opened and one of the princesses, the count\u2019s niece, entered with a cold, stern face. The length of her body was strikingly out of proportion to her short legs. Prince Vas\u00edli turned to her.\n\n\u201cWell, how is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cStill the same; but what can you expect, this noise...\u201d said the princess, looking at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as at a stranger.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear, I hardly knew you,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with a happy smile, ambling lightly up to the count\u2019s niece. \u201cI have come, and am at your service to help you nurse my uncle. I imagine what you have gone through,\u201d and she sympathetically turned up her eyes.\n\nThe princess gave no reply and did not even smile, but left the room as Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna took off her gloves and, occupying the position she had conquered, settled down in an armchair, inviting Prince Vas\u00edli to take a seat beside her.\n\n\u201cBor\u00eds,\u201d she said to her son with a smile, \u201cI shall go in to see the count, my uncle; but you, my dear, had better go to Pierre meanwhile and don\u2019t forget to give him the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 invitation. They ask him to dinner. I suppose he won\u2019t go?\u201d she continued, turning to the prince.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d replied the prince, who had plainly become depressed, \u201cI shall be only too glad if you relieve me of that young man.... Here he is, and the count has not once asked for him.\u201d\n\nHe shrugged his shoulders. A footman conducted Bor\u00eds down one flight of stairs and up another, to Pierre\u2019s rooms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nPierre, after all, had not managed to choose a career for himself in Petersburg, and had been expelled from there for riotous conduct and sent to Moscow. The story told about him at Count Rost\u00f3v\u2019s was true. Pierre had taken part in tying a policeman to a bear. He had now been for some days in Moscow and was staying as usual at his father\u2019s house. Though he expected that the story of his escapade would be already known in Moscow and that the ladies about his father\u2014who were never favorably disposed toward him\u2014would have used it to turn the count against him, he nevertheless on the day of his arrival went to his father\u2019s part of the house. Entering the drawing room, where the princesses spent most of their time, he greeted the ladies, two of whom were sitting at embroidery frames while a third read aloud. It was the eldest who was reading\u2014the one who had met Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. The two younger ones were embroidering: both were rosy and pretty and they differed only in that one had a little mole on her lip which made her much prettier. Pierre was received as if he were a corpse or a leper. The eldest princess paused in her reading and silently stared at him with frightened eyes; the second assumed precisely the same expression; while the youngest, the one with the mole, who was of a cheerful and lively disposition, bent over her frame to hide a smile probably evoked by the amusing scene she foresaw. She drew her wool down through the canvas and, scarcely able to refrain from laughing, stooped as if trying to make out the pattern.\n\n\u201cHow do you do, cousin?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cYou don\u2019t recognize me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI recognize you only too well, too well.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is the count? Can I see him?\u201d asked Pierre, awkwardly as usual, but unabashed.\n\n\u201cThe count is suffering physically and mentally, and apparently you have done your best to increase his mental sufferings.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I see the count?\u201d Pierre again asked.\n\n\u201cHm.... If you wish to kill him, to kill him outright, you can see him... Olga, go and see whether Uncle\u2019s beef tea is ready\u2014it is almost time,\u201d she added, giving Pierre to understand that they were busy, and busy making his father comfortable, while evidently he, Pierre, was only busy causing him annoyance.\n\nOlga went out. Pierre stood looking at the sisters; then he bowed and said: \u201cThen I will go to my rooms. You will let me know when I can see him.\u201d\n\nAnd he left the room, followed by the low but ringing laughter of the sister with the mole.\n\nNext day Prince Vas\u00edli had arrived and settled in the count\u2019s house. He sent for Pierre and said to him: \u201cMy dear fellow, if you are going to behave here as you did in Petersburg, you will end very badly; that is all I have to say to you. The count is very, very ill, and you must not see him at all.\u201d\n\nSince then Pierre had not been disturbed and had spent the whole time in his rooms upstairs.\n\nWhen Bor\u00eds appeared at his door Pierre was pacing up and down his room, stopping occasionally at a corner to make menacing gestures at the wall, as if running a sword through an invisible foe, and glaring savagely over his spectacles, and then again resuming his walk, muttering indistinct words, shrugging his shoulders and gesticulating.\n\n\u201cEngland is done for,\u201d said he, scowling and pointing his finger at someone unseen. \u201cMr. Pitt, as a traitor to the nation and to the rights of man, is sentenced to...\u201d But before Pierre\u2014who at that moment imagined himself to be Napoleon in person and to have just effected the dangerous crossing of the Straits of Dover and captured London\u2014could pronounce Pitt\u2019s sentence, he saw a well-built and handsome young officer entering his room. Pierre paused. He had left Moscow when Bor\u00eds was a boy of fourteen, and had quite forgotten him, but in his usual impulsive and hearty way he took Bor\u00eds by the hand with a friendly smile.\n\n\u201cDo you remember me?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds quietly with a pleasant smile. \u201cI have come with my mother to see the count, but it seems he is not well.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it seems he is ill. People are always disturbing him,\u201d answered Pierre, trying to remember who this young man was.\n\nBor\u00eds felt that Pierre did not recognize him but did not consider it necessary to introduce himself, and without experiencing the least embarrassment looked Pierre straight in the face.\n\n\u201cCount Rost\u00f3v asks you to come to dinner today,\u201d said he, after a considerable pause which made Pierre feel uncomfortable.\n\n\u201cAh, Count Rost\u00f3v!\u201d exclaimed Pierre joyfully. \u201cThen you are his son, Ily\u00e1? Only fancy, I didn\u2019t know you at first. Do you remember how we went to the Sparrow Hills with Madame Jacquot?... It\u2019s such an age...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are mistaken,\u201d said Bor\u00eds deliberately, with a bold and slightly sarcastic smile. \u201cI am Bor\u00eds, son of Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna Drubetsk\u00e1ya. Rost\u00f3v, the father, is Ily\u00e1, and his son is Nicholas. I never knew any Madame Jacquot.\u201d\n\nPierre shook his head and arms as if attacked by mosquitoes or bees.\n\n\u201cOh dear, what am I thinking about? I\u2019ve mixed everything up. One has so many relatives in Moscow! So you are Bor\u00eds? Of course. Well, now we know where we are. And what do you think of the Boulogne expedition? The English will come off badly, you know, if Napoleon gets across the Channel. I think the expedition is quite feasible. If only Villeneuve doesn\u2019t make a mess of things!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds knew nothing about the Boulogne expedition; he did not read the papers and it was the first time he had heard Villeneuve\u2019s name.\n\n\u201cWe here in Moscow are more occupied with dinner parties and scandal than with politics,\u201d said he in his quiet ironical tone. \u201cI know nothing about it and have not thought about it. Moscow is chiefly busy with gossip,\u201d he continued. \u201cJust now they are talking about you and your father.\u201d\n\nPierre smiled in his good-natured way as if afraid for his companion\u2019s sake that the latter might say something he would afterwards regret. But Bor\u00eds spoke distinctly, clearly, and dryly, looking straight into Pierre\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cMoscow has nothing else to do but gossip,\u201d Bor\u00eds went on. \u201cEverybody is wondering to whom the count will leave his fortune, though he may perhaps outlive us all, as I sincerely hope he will...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is all very horrid,\u201d interrupted Pierre, \u201cvery horrid.\u201d\n\nPierre was still afraid that this officer might inadvertently say something disconcerting to himself.\n\n\u201cAnd it must seem to you,\u201d said Bor\u00eds flushing slightly, but not changing his tone or attitude, \u201cit must seem to you that everyone is trying to get something out of the rich man?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo it does,\u201d thought Pierre.\n\n\u201cBut I just wish to say, to avoid misunderstandings, that you are quite mistaken if you reckon me or my mother among such people. We are very poor, but for my own part at any rate, for the very reason that your father is rich, I don\u2019t regard myself as a relation of his, and neither I nor my mother would ever ask or take anything from him.\u201d\n\nFor a long time Pierre could not understand, but when he did, he jumped up from the sofa, seized Bor\u00eds under the elbow in his quick, clumsy way, and, blushing far more than Bor\u00eds, began to speak with a feeling of mingled shame and vexation.\n\n\u201cWell, this is strange! Do you suppose I... who could think?... I know very well...\u201d\n\nBut Bor\u00eds again interrupted him.\n\n\u201cI am glad I have spoken out fully. Perhaps you did not like it? You must excuse me,\u201d said he, putting Pierre at ease instead of being put at ease by him, \u201cbut I hope I have not offended you. I always make it a rule to speak out... Well, what answer am I to take? Will you come to dinner at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019?\u201d\n\nAnd Bor\u00eds, having apparently relieved himself of an onerous duty and extricated himself from an awkward situation and placed another in it, became quite pleasant again.\n\n\u201cNo, but I say,\u201d said Pierre, calming down, \u201cyou are a wonderful fellow! What you have just said is good, very good. Of course you don\u2019t know me. We have not met for such a long time... not since we were children. You might think that I... I understand, quite understand. I could not have done it myself, I should not have had the courage, but it\u2019s splendid. I am very glad to have made your acquaintance. It\u2019s queer,\u201d he added after a pause, \u201cthat you should have suspected me!\u201d He began to laugh. \u201cWell, what of it! I hope we\u2019ll get better acquainted,\u201d and he pressed Bor\u00eds\u2019 hand. \u201cDo you know, I have not once been in to see the count. He has not sent for me.... I am sorry for him as a man, but what can one do?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you think Napoleon will manage to get an army across?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds with a smile.\n\nPierre saw that Bor\u00eds wished to change the subject, and being of the same mind he began explaining the advantages and disadvantages of the Boulogne expedition.\n\nA footman came in to summon Bor\u00eds\u2014the princess was going. Pierre, in order to make Bor\u00eds\u2019 better acquaintance, promised to come to dinner, and warmly pressing his hand looked affectionately over his spectacles into Bor\u00eds\u2019 eyes. After he had gone Pierre continued pacing up and down the room for a long time, no longer piercing an imaginary foe with his imaginary sword, but smiling at the remembrance of that pleasant, intelligent, and resolute young man.\n\nAs often happens in early youth, especially to one who leads a lonely life, he felt an unaccountable tenderness for this young man and made up his mind that they would be friends.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli saw the princess off. She held a handkerchief to her eyes and her face was tearful.\n\n\u201cIt is dreadful, dreadful!\u201d she was saying, \u201cbut cost me what it may I shall do my duty. I will come and spend the night. He must not be left like this. Every moment is precious. I can\u2019t think why his nieces put it off. Perhaps God will help me to find a way to prepare him!... Adieu, Prince! May God support you...\u201d\n\n\u201cAdieu, ma bonne,\u201d answered Prince Vas\u00edli turning away from her.\n\n\u201cOh, he is in a dreadful state,\u201d said the mother to her son when they were in the carriage. \u201cHe hardly recognizes anybody.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand, Mamma\u2014what is his attitude to Pierre?\u201d asked the son.\n\n\u201cThe will will show that, my dear; our fate also depends on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why do you expect that he will leave us anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my dear! He is so rich, and we are so poor!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that is hardly a sufficient reason, Mamma...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Heaven! How ill he is!\u201d exclaimed the mother.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna had driven off with her son to visit Count Cyril Vlad\u00edmirovich Bez\u00fakhov, Countess Rost\u00f3va sat for a long time all alone applying her handkerchief to her eyes. At last she rang.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with you, my dear?\u201d she said crossly to the maid who kept her waiting some minutes. \u201cDon\u2019t you wish to serve me? Then I\u2019ll find you another place.\u201d\n\nThe countess was upset by her friend\u2019s sorrow and humiliating poverty, and was therefore out of sorts, a state of mind which with her always found expression in calling her maid \u201cmy dear\u201d and speaking to her with exaggerated politeness.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry, ma\u2019am,\u201d answered the maid.\n\n\u201cAsk the count to come to me.\u201d\n\nThe count came waddling in to see his wife with a rather guilty look as usual.\n\n\u201cWell, little countess? What a saut\u00e9 of game au mad\u00e8re we are to have, my dear! I tasted it. The thousand rubles I paid for Tar\u00e1s were not ill-spent. He is worth it!\u201d\n\nHe sat down by his wife, his elbows on his knees and his hands ruffling his gray hair.\n\n\u201cWhat are your commands, little countess?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, my dear... What\u2019s that mess?\u201d she said, pointing to his waistcoat. \u201cIt\u2019s the saut\u00e9, most likely,\u201d she added with a smile. \u201cWell, you see, Count, I want some money.\u201d\n\nHer face became sad.\n\n\u201cOh, little countess!\u201d ... and the count began bustling to get out his pocketbook.\n\n\u201cI want a great deal, Count! I want five hundred rubles,\u201d and taking out her cambric handkerchief she began wiping her husband\u2019s waistcoat.\n\n\u201cYes, immediately, immediately! Hey, who\u2019s there?\u201d he called out in a tone only used by persons who are certain that those they call will rush to obey the summons. \u201cSend Dm\u00edtri to me!\u201d\n\nDm\u00edtri, a man of good family who had been brought up in the count\u2019s house and now managed all his affairs, stepped softly into the room.\n\n\u201cThis is what I want, my dear fellow,\u201d said the count to the deferential young man who had entered. \u201cBring me...\u201d he reflected a moment, \u201cyes, bring me seven hundred rubles, yes! But mind, don\u2019t bring me such tattered and dirty notes as last time, but nice clean ones for the countess.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, Dm\u00edtri, clean ones, please,\u201d said the countess, sighing deeply.\n\n\u201cWhen would you like them, your excellency?\u201d asked Dm\u00edtri. \u201cAllow me to inform you... But, don\u2019t be uneasy,\u201d he added, noticing that the count was beginning to breathe heavily and quickly which was always a sign of approaching anger. \u201cI was forgetting... Do you wish it brought at once?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes; just so! Bring it. Give it to the countess.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a treasure that Dm\u00edtri is,\u201d added the count with a smile when the young man had departed. \u201cThere is never any \u2018impossible\u2019 with him. That\u2019s a thing I hate! Everything is possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, money, Count, money! How much sorrow it causes in the world,\u201d said the countess. \u201cBut I am in great need of this sum.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, my little countess, are a notorious spendthrift,\u201d said the count, and having kissed his wife\u2019s hand he went back to his study.\n\nWhen Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna returned from Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s the money, all in clean notes, was lying ready under a handkerchief on the countess\u2019 little table, and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna noticed that something was agitating her.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear?\u201d asked the countess.\n\n\u201cOh, what a terrible state he is in! One would not know him, he is so ill! I was only there a few moments and hardly said a word...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnnette, for heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t refuse me,\u201d the countess began, with a blush that looked very strange on her thin, dignified, elderly face, and she took the money from under the handkerchief.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna instantly guessed her intention and stooped to be ready to embrace the countess at the appropriate moment.\n\n\u201cThis is for Bor\u00eds from me, for his outfit.\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna was already embracing her and weeping. The countess wept too. They wept because they were friends, and because they were kindhearted, and because they\u2014friends from childhood\u2014had to think about such a base thing as money, and because their youth was over.... But those tears were pleasant to them both.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nCountess Rost\u00f3va, with her daughters and a large number of guests, was already seated in the drawing room. The count took the gentlemen into his study and showed them his choice collection of Turkish pipes. From time to time he went out to ask: \u201cHasn\u2019t she come yet?\u201d They were expecting M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna Akhros\u00edmova, known in society as le terrible dragon, a lady distinguished not for wealth or rank, but for common sense and frank plainness of speech. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna was known to the Imperial family as well as to all Moscow and Petersburg, and both cities wondered at her, laughed privately at her rudenesses, and told good stories about her, while none the less all without exception respected and feared her.\n\nIn the count\u2019s room, which was full of tobacco smoke, they talked of the war that had been announced in a manifesto, and about the recruiting. None of them had yet seen the manifesto, but they all knew it had appeared. The count sat on the sofa between two guests who were smoking and talking. He neither smoked nor talked, but bending his head first to one side and then to the other watched the smokers with evident pleasure and listened to the conversation of his two neighbors, whom he egged on against each other.\n\nOne of them was a sallow, clean-shaven civilian with a thin and wrinkled face, already growing old, though he was dressed like a most fashionable young man. He sat with his legs up on the sofa as if quite at home and, having stuck an amber mouthpiece far into his mouth, was inhaling the smoke spasmodically and screwing up his eyes. This was an old bachelor, Shinsh\u00edn, a cousin of the countess\u2019, a man with \u201ca sharp tongue\u201d as they said in Moscow society. He seemed to be condescending to his companion. The latter, a fresh, rosy officer of the Guards, irreproachably washed, brushed, and buttoned, held his pipe in the middle of his mouth and with red lips gently inhaled the smoke, letting it escape from his handsome mouth in rings. This was Lieutenant Berg, an officer in the Sem\u00ebnov regiment with whom Bor\u00eds was to travel to join the army, and about whom Nat\u00e1sha had teased her elder sister V\u00e9ra, speaking of Berg as her \u201cintended.\u201d The count sat between them and listened attentively. His favorite occupation when not playing boston, a card game he was very fond of, was that of listener, especially when he succeeded in setting two loquacious talkers at one another.\n\n\u201cWell, then, old chap, mon tr\u00e8s honorable Alphonse K\u00e1rlovich,\u201d said Shinsh\u00edn, laughing ironically and mixing the most ordinary Russian expressions with the choicest French phrases\u2014which was a peculiarity of his speech. \u201cVous comptez vous faire des rentes sur l\u2019\u00e9tat; you want to make something out of your company?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich; I only want to show that in the cavalry the advantages are far less than in the infantry. Just consider my own position now, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich...\u201d\n\nBerg always spoke quietly, politely, and with great precision. His conversation always related entirely to himself; he would remain calm and silent when the talk related to any topic that had no direct bearing on himself. He could remain silent for hours without being at all put out of countenance himself or making others uncomfortable, but as soon as the conversation concerned himself he would begin to talk circumstantially and with evident satisfaction.\n\n\u201cConsider my position, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich. Were I in the cavalry I should get not more than two hundred rubles every four months, even with the rank of lieutenant; but as it is I receive two hundred and thirty,\u201d said he, looking at Shinsh\u00edn and the count with a joyful, pleasant smile, as if it were obvious to him that his success must always be the chief desire of everyone else.\n\n\u201cBesides that, Peter Nikol\u00e1evich, by exchanging into the Guards I shall be in a more prominent position,\u201d continued Berg, \u201cand vacancies occur much more frequently in the Foot Guards. Then just think what can be done with two hundred and thirty rubles! I even manage to put a little aside and to send something to my father,\u201d he went on, emitting a smoke ring.\n\n\u201cLa balance y est... A German knows how to skin a flint, as the proverb says,\u201d remarked Shinsh\u00edn, moving his pipe to the other side of his mouth and winking at the count.\n\nThe count burst out laughing. The other guests seeing that Shinsh\u00edn was talking came up to listen. Berg, oblivious of irony or indifference, continued to explain how by exchanging into the Guards he had already gained a step on his old comrades of the Cadet Corps; how in wartime the company commander might get killed and he, as senior in the company, might easily succeed to the post; how popular he was with everyone in the regiment, and how satisfied his father was with him. Berg evidently enjoyed narrating all this, and did not seem to suspect that others, too, might have their own interests. But all he said was so prettily sedate, and the na\u00efvet\u00e9 of his youthful egotism was so obvious, that he disarmed his hearers.\n\n\u201cWell, my boy, you\u2019ll get along wherever you go\u2014foot or horse\u2014that I\u2019ll warrant,\u201d said Shinsh\u00edn, patting him on the shoulder and taking his feet off the sofa.\n\nBerg smiled joyously. The count, followed by his guests, went into the drawing room.\n\nIt was just the moment before a big dinner when the assembled guests, expecting the summons to zak\u00faska, avoid engaging in any long conversation but think it necessary to move about and talk, in order to show that they are not at all impatient for their food. The host and hostess look toward the door, and now and then glance at one another, and the visitors try to guess from these glances who, or what, they are waiting for\u2014some important relation who has not yet arrived, or a dish that is not yet ready.\n\nPierre had come just at dinnertime and was sitting awkwardly in the middle of the drawing room on the first chair he had come across, blocking the way for everyone. The countess tried to make him talk, but he went on na\u00efvely looking around through his spectacles as if in search of somebody and answered all her questions in monosyllables. He was in the way and was the only one who did not notice the fact. Most of the guests, knowing of the affair with the bear, looked with curiosity at this big, stout, quiet man, wondering how such a clumsy, modest fellow could have played such a prank on a policeman.\n\n\u201cYou have only lately arrived?\u201d the countess asked him.\n\n\u201cOui, madame,\u201d replied he, looking around him.\n\n\u201cYou have not yet seen my husband?\u201d\n\n\u201cNon, madame.\u201d He smiled quite inappropriately.\n\n\u201cYou have been in Paris recently, I believe? I suppose it\u2019s very interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery interesting.\u201d\n\nThe countess exchanged glances with Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. The latter understood that she was being asked to entertain this young man, and sitting down beside him she began to speak about his father; but he answered her, as he had the countess, only in monosyllables. The other guests were all conversing with one another. \u201cThe Razum\u00f3vskis... It was charming... You are very kind... Countess Apr\u00e1ksina...\u201d was heard on all sides. The countess rose and went into the ballroom.\n\n\u201cM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna?\u201d came her voice from there.\n\n\u201cHerself,\u201d came the answer in a rough voice, and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna entered the room.\n\nAll the unmarried ladies and even the married ones except the very oldest rose. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna paused at the door. Tall and stout, holding high her fifty-year-old head with its gray curls, she stood surveying the guests, and leisurely arranged her wide sleeves as if rolling them up. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna always spoke in Russian.\n\n\u201cHealth and happiness to her whose name day we are keeping and to her children,\u201d she said, in her loud, full-toned voice which drowned all others. \u201cWell, you old sinner,\u201d she went on, turning to the count who was kissing her hand, \u201cyou\u2019re feeling dull in Moscow, I daresay? Nowhere to hunt with your dogs? But what is to be done, old man? Just see how these nestlings are growing up,\u201d and she pointed to the girls. \u201cYou must look for husbands for them whether you like it or not....\u201d\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d said she, \u201chow\u2019s my Cossack?\u201d (M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna always called Nat\u00e1sha a Cossack) and she stroked the child\u2019s arm as she came up fearless and gay to kiss her hand. \u201cI know she\u2019s a scamp of a girl, but I like her.\u201d\n\nShe took a pair of pear-shaped ruby earrings from her huge reticule and, having given them to the rosy Nat\u00e1sha, who beamed with the pleasure of her saint\u2019s-day fete, turned away at once and addressed herself to Pierre.\n\n\u201cEh, eh, friend! Come here a bit,\u201d said she, assuming a soft high tone of voice. \u201cCome here, my friend...\u201d and she ominously tucked up her sleeves still higher. Pierre approached, looking at her in a childlike way through his spectacles.\n\n\u201cCome nearer, come nearer, friend! I used to be the only one to tell your father the truth when he was in favor, and in your case it\u2019s my evident duty.\u201d She paused. All were silent, expectant of what was to follow, for this was clearly only a prelude.\n\n\u201cA fine lad! My word! A fine lad!... His father lies on his deathbed and he amuses himself setting a policeman astride a bear! For shame, sir, for shame! It would be better if you went to the war.\u201d\n\nShe turned away and gave her hand to the count, who could hardly keep from laughing.\n\n\u201cWell, I suppose it is time we were at table?\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\nThe count went in first with M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, the countess followed on the arm of a colonel of hussars, a man of importance to them because Nicholas was to go with him to the regiment; then came Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with Shinsh\u00edn. Berg gave his arm to V\u00e9ra. The smiling Julie Kar\u00e1gina went in with Nicholas. After them other couples followed, filling the whole dining hall, and last of all the children, tutors, and governesses followed singly. The footmen began moving about, chairs scraped, the band struck up in the gallery, and the guests settled down in their places. Then the strains of the count\u2019s household band were replaced by the clatter of knives and forks, the voices of visitors, and the soft steps of the footmen. At one end of the table sat the countess with M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna on her right and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna on her left, the other lady visitors were farther down. At the other end sat the count, with the hussar colonel on his left and Shinsh\u00edn and the other male visitors on his right. Midway down the long table on one side sat the grown-up young people: V\u00e9ra beside Berg, and Pierre beside Bor\u00eds; and on the other side, the children, tutors, and governesses. From behind the crystal decanters and fruit vases, the count kept glancing at his wife and her tall cap with its light-blue ribbons, and busily filled his neighbors\u2019 glasses, not neglecting his own. The countess in turn, without omitting her duties as hostess, threw significant glances from behind the pineapples at her husband whose face and bald head seemed by their redness to contrast more than usual with his gray hair. At the ladies\u2019 end an even chatter of voices was heard all the time, at the men\u2019s end the voices sounded louder and louder, especially that of the colonel of hussars who, growing more and more flushed, ate and drank so much that the count held him up as a pattern to the other guests. Berg with tender smiles was saying to V\u00e9ra that love is not an earthly but a heavenly feeling. Bor\u00eds was telling his new friend Pierre who the guests were and exchanging glances with Nat\u00e1sha, who was sitting opposite. Pierre spoke little but examined the new faces, and ate a great deal. Of the two soups he chose turtle with savory patties and went on to the game without omitting a single dish or one of the wines. These latter the butler thrust mysteriously forward, wrapped in a napkin, from behind the next man\u2019s shoulders and whispered: \u201cDry Madeira\u201d... \u201cHungarian\u201d... or \u201cRhine wine\u201d as the case might be. Of the four crystal glasses engraved with the count\u2019s monogram that stood before his plate, Pierre held out one at random and drank with enjoyment, gazing with ever-increasing amiability at the other guests. Nat\u00e1sha, who sat opposite, was looking at Bor\u00eds as girls of thirteen look at the boy they are in love with and have just kissed for the first time. Sometimes that same look fell on Pierre, and that funny lively little girl\u2019s look made him inclined to laugh without knowing why.\n\nNicholas sat at some distance from S\u00f3nya, beside Julie Kar\u00e1gina, to whom he was again talking with the same involuntary smile. S\u00f3nya wore a company smile but was evidently tormented by jealousy; now she turned pale, now blushed and strained every nerve to overhear what Nicholas and Julie were saying to one another. The governess kept looking round uneasily as if preparing to resent any slight that might be put upon the children. The German tutor was trying to remember all the dishes, wines, and kinds of dessert, in order to send a full description of the dinner to his people in Germany; and he felt greatly offended when the butler with a bottle wrapped in a napkin passed him by. He frowned, trying to appear as if he did not want any of that wine, but was mortified because no one would understand that it was not to quench his thirst or from greediness that he wanted it, but simply from a conscientious desire for knowledge.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nAt the men\u2019s end of the table the talk grew more and more animated. The colonel told them that the declaration of war had already appeared in Petersburg and that a copy, which he had himself seen, had that day been forwarded by courier to the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cAnd why the deuce are we going to fight Bonaparte?\u201d remarked Shinsh\u00edn. \u201cHe has stopped Austria\u2019s cackle and I fear it will be our turn next.\u201d\n\nThe colonel was a stout, tall, plethoric German, evidently devoted to the service and patriotically Russian. He resented Shinsh\u00edn\u2019s remark.\n\n\u201cIt is for the reasson, my goot sir,\u201d said he, speaking with a German accent, \u201cfor the reasson zat ze Emperor knows zat. He declares in ze manifessto zat he cannot fiew wiz indifference ze danger vreatening Russia and zat ze safety and dignity of ze Empire as vell as ze sanctity of its alliances...\u201d he spoke this last word with particular emphasis as if in it lay the gist of the matter.\n\nThen with the unerring official memory that characterized him he repeated from the opening words of the manifesto:\n\n... and the wish, which constitutes the Emperor\u2019s sole and absolute aim\u2014to establish peace in Europe on firm foundations\u2014has now decided him to despatch part of the army abroad and to create a new condition for the attainment of that purpose.\n\n\u201cZat, my dear sir, is vy...\u201d he concluded, drinking a tumbler of wine with dignity and looking to the count for approval.\n\n\u201cConnaissez-vous le Proverbe: \u2018Jerome, Jerome, do not roam, but turn spindles at home!\u2019?\u201d said Shinsh\u00edn, puckering his brows and smiling. \u201cCela nous convient \u00e0 merveille. Suv\u00f3rov now\u2014he knew what he was about; yet they beat him \u00e0 plate couture, and where are we to find Suv\u00f3rovs now? Je vous demande un peu,\u201d  said he, continually changing from French to Russian.\n\n\u201cVe must vight to the last tr-r-op of our plood!\u201d said the colonel, thumping the table; \u201cand ve must tie for our Emperor, and zen all vill pe vell. And ve must discuss it as little as po-o-ossible\u201d... he dwelt particularly on the word possible... \u201cas po-o-ossible,\u201d he ended, again turning to the count. \u201cZat is how ve old hussars look at it, and zere\u2019s an end of it! And how do you, a young man and a young hussar, how do you judge of it?\u201d he added, addressing Nicholas, who when he heard that the war was being discussed had turned from his partner with eyes and ears intent on the colonel.\n\n\u201cI am quite of your opinion,\u201d replied Nicholas, flaming up, turning his plate round and moving his wineglasses about with as much decision and desperation as though he were at that moment facing some great danger. \u201cI am convinced that we Russians must die or conquer,\u201d he concluded, conscious\u2014as were others\u2014after the words were uttered that his remarks were too enthusiastic and emphatic for the occasion and were therefore awkward.\n\n\u201cWhat you said just now was splendid!\u201d said his partner Julie.\n\nS\u00f3nya trembled all over and blushed to her ears and behind them and down to her neck and shoulders while Nicholas was speaking.\n\nPierre listened to the colonel\u2019s speech and nodded approvingly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cThe young man\u2019s a real hussar!\u201d shouted the colonel, again thumping the table.\n\n\u201cWhat are you making such a noise about over there?\u201d M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s deep voice suddenly inquired from the other end of the table. \u201cWhat are you thumping the table for?\u201d she demanded of the hussar, \u201cand why are you exciting yourself? Do you think the French are here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am speaking ze truce,\u201d replied the hussar with a smile.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about the war,\u201d the count shouted down the table. \u201cYou know my son\u2019s going, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna? My son is going.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have four sons in the army but still I don\u2019t fret. It is all in God\u2019s hands. You may die in your bed or God may spare you in a battle,\u201d replied M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s deep voice, which easily carried the whole length of the table.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s true!\u201d\n\nOnce more the conversations concentrated, the ladies\u2019 at the one end and the men\u2019s at the other.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t ask,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s little brother was saying; \u201cI know you won\u2019t ask!\u201d\n\n\u201cI will,\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nHer face suddenly flushed with reckless and joyous resolution. She half rose, by a glance inviting Pierre, who sat opposite, to listen to what was coming, and turning to her mother:\n\n\u201cMamma!\u201d rang out the clear contralto notes of her childish voice, audible the whole length of the table.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the countess, startled; but seeing by her daughter\u2019s face that it was only mischief, she shook a finger at her sternly with a threatening and forbidding movement of her head.\n\nThe conversation was hushed.\n\n\u201cMamma! What sweets are we going to have?\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice sounded still more firm and resolute.\n\nThe countess tried to frown, but could not. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna shook her fat finger.\n\n\u201cCossack!\u201d she said threateningly.\n\nMost of the guests, uncertain how to regard this sally, looked at the elders.\n\n\u201cYou had better take care!\u201d said the countess.\n\n\u201cMamma! What sweets are we going to have?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha again cried boldly, with saucy gaiety, confident that her prank would be taken in good part.\n\nS\u00f3nya and fat little P\u00e9tya doubled up with laughter.\n\n\u201cYou see! I have asked,\u201d whispered Nat\u00e1sha to her little brother and to Pierre, glancing at him again.\n\n\u201cIce pudding, but you won\u2019t get any,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\nNat\u00e1sha saw there was nothing to be afraid of and so she braved even M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\n\u201cM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna! What kind of ice pudding? I don\u2019t like ice cream.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarrot ices.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! What kind, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna? What kind?\u201d she almost screamed; \u201cI want to know!\u201d\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna and the countess burst out laughing, and all the guests joined in. Everyone laughed, not at M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s answer but at the incredible boldness and smartness of this little girl who had dared to treat M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna in this fashion.\n\nNat\u00e1sha only desisted when she had been told that there would be pineapple ice. Before the ices, champagne was served round. The band again struck up, the count and countess kissed, and the guests, leaving their seats, went up to \u201ccongratulate\u201d the countess, and reached across the table to clink glasses with the count, with the children, and with one another. Again the footmen rushed about, chairs scraped, and in the same order in which they had entered but with redder faces, the guests returned to the drawing room and to the count\u2019s study.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe card tables were drawn out, sets made up for boston, and the count\u2019s visitors settled themselves, some in the two drawing rooms, some in the sitting room, some in the library.\n\nThe count, holding his cards fanwise, kept himself with difficulty from dropping into his usual after-dinner nap, and laughed at everything. The young people, at the countess\u2019 instigation, gathered round the clavichord and harp. Julie by general request played first. After she had played a little air with variations on the harp, she joined the other young ladies in begging Nat\u00e1sha and Nicholas, who were noted for their musical talent, to sing something. Nat\u00e1sha, who was treated as though she were grown up, was evidently very proud of this but at the same time felt shy.\n\n\u201cWhat shall we sing?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201c\u2018The Brook,\u2019\u201d suggested Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWell, then, let\u2019s be quick. Bor\u00eds, come here,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cBut where is S\u00f3nya?\u201d\n\nShe looked round and seeing that her friend was not in the room ran to look for her.\n\nRunning into S\u00f3nya\u2019s room and not finding her there, Nat\u00e1sha ran to the nursery, but S\u00f3nya was not there either. Nat\u00e1sha concluded that she must be on the chest in the passage. The chest in the passage was the place of mourning for the younger female generation in the Rost\u00f3v household. And there in fact was S\u00f3nya lying face downward on Nurse\u2019s dirty feather bed on the top of the chest, crumpling her gauzy pink dress under her, hiding her face with her slender fingers, and sobbing so convulsively that her bare little shoulders shook. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, which had been so radiantly happy all that saint\u2019s day, suddenly changed: her eyes became fixed, and then a shiver passed down her broad neck and the corners of her mouth drooped.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya! What is it? What is the matter?... Oo... Oo... Oo...!\u201d And Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s large mouth widened, making her look quite ugly, and she began to wail like a baby without knowing why, except that S\u00f3nya was crying. S\u00f3nya tried to lift her head to answer but could not, and hid her face still deeper in the bed. Nat\u00e1sha wept, sitting on the blue-striped feather bed and hugging her friend. With an effort S\u00f3nya sat up and began wiping her eyes and explaining.\n\n\u201cNicholas is going away in a week\u2019s time, his... papers... have come... he told me himself... but still I should not cry,\u201d and she showed a paper she held in her hand\u2014with the verses Nicholas had written, \u201cstill, I should not cry, but you can\u2019t... no one can understand... what a soul he has!\u201d\n\nAnd she began to cry again because he had such a noble soul.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you... I am not envious... I love you and Bor\u00eds also,\u201d she went on, gaining a little strength; \u201che is nice... there are no difficulties in your way.... But Nicholas is my cousin... one would have to... the Metropolitan himself... and even then it can\u2019t be done. And besides, if she tells Mamma\u201d (S\u00f3nya looked upon the countess as her mother and called her so) \u201cthat I am spoiling Nicholas\u2019 career and am heartless and ungrateful, while truly... God is my witness,\u201d and she made the sign of the cross, \u201cI love her so much, and all of you, only V\u00e9ra... And what for? What have I done to her? I am so grateful to you that I would willingly sacrifice everything, only I have nothing....\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya could not continue, and again hid her face in her hands and in the feather bed. Nat\u00e1sha began consoling her, but her face showed that she understood all the gravity of her friend\u2019s trouble.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya,\u201d she suddenly exclaimed, as if she had guessed the true reason of her friend\u2019s sorrow, \u201cI\u2019m sure V\u00e9ra has said something to you since dinner? Hasn\u2019t she?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, these verses Nicholas wrote himself and I copied some others, and she found them on my table and said she\u2019d show them to Mamma, and that I was ungrateful, and that Mamma would never allow him to marry me, but that he\u2019ll marry Julie. You see how he\u2019s been with her all day... Nat\u00e1sha, what have I done to deserve it?...\u201d\n\nAnd again she began to sob, more bitterly than before. Nat\u00e1sha lifted her up, hugged her, and, smiling through her tears, began comforting her.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, don\u2019t believe her, darling! Don\u2019t believe her! Do you remember how we and Nicholas, all three of us, talked in the sitting room after supper? Why, we settled how everything was to be. I don\u2019t quite remember how, but don\u2019t you remember that it could all be arranged and how nice it all was? There\u2019s Uncle Shinsh\u00edn\u2019s brother has married his first cousin. And we are only second cousins, you know. And Bor\u00eds says it is quite possible. You know I have told him all about it. And he is so clever and so good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDon\u2019t you cry, S\u00f3nya, dear love, darling S\u00f3nya!\u201d and she kissed her and laughed. \u201cV\u00e9ra\u2019s spiteful; never mind her! And all will come right and she won\u2019t say anything to Mamma. Nicholas will tell her himself, and he doesn\u2019t care at all for Julie.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha kissed her on the hair.\n\nS\u00f3nya sat up. The little kitten brightened, its eyes shone, and it seemed ready to lift its tail, jump down on its soft paws, and begin playing with the ball of worsted as a kitten should.\n\n\u201cDo you think so?... Really? Truly?\u201d she said, quickly smoothing her frock and hair.\n\n\u201cReally, truly!\u201d answered Nat\u00e1sha, pushing in a crisp lock that had strayed from under her friend\u2019s plaits.\n\nBoth laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go and sing \u2018The Brook.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCome along!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, that fat Pierre who sat opposite me is so funny!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, stopping suddenly. \u201cI feel so happy!\u201d\n\nAnd she set off at a run along the passage.\n\nS\u00f3nya, shaking off some down which clung to her and tucking away the verses in the bosom of her dress close to her bony little chest, ran after Nat\u00e1sha down the passage into the sitting room with flushed face and light, joyous steps. At the visitors\u2019 request the young people sang the quartette, \u201cThe Brook,\u201d with which everyone was delighted. Then Nicholas sang a song he had just learned:\n\n\nAt nighttime in the moon\u2019s fair glow\n  How sweet, as fancies wander free,\nTo feel that in this world there\u2019s one\n  Who still is thinking but of thee!\n\nThat while her fingers touch the harp\n  Wafting sweet music o\u2019er the lea,\nIt is for thee thus swells her heart,\n  Sighing its message out to thee...\n\nA day or two, then bliss unspoilt,\n  But oh! till then I cannot live!...\n\n\nHe had not finished the last verse before the young people began to get ready to dance in the large hall, and the sound of the feet and the coughing of the musicians were heard from the gallery.\n\n\nPierre was sitting in the drawing room where Shinsh\u00edn had engaged him, as a man recently returned from abroad, in a political conversation in which several others joined but which bored Pierre. When the music began Nat\u00e1sha came in and walking straight up to Pierre said, laughing and blushing:\n\n\u201cMamma told me to ask you to join the dancers.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid of mixing the figures,\u201d Pierre replied; \u201cbut if you will be my teacher...\u201d And lowering his big arm he offered it to the slender little girl.\n\nWhile the couples were arranging themselves and the musicians tuning up, Pierre sat down with his little partner. Nat\u00e1sha was perfectly happy; she was dancing with a grown-up man, who had been abroad. She was sitting in a conspicuous place and talking to him like a grown-up lady. She had a fan in her hand that one of the ladies had given her to hold. Assuming quite the pose of a society woman (heaven knows when and where she had learned it) she talked with her partner, fanning herself and smiling over the fan.\n\n\u201cDear, dear! Just look at her!\u201d exclaimed the countess as she crossed the ballroom, pointing to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nNat\u00e1sha blushed and laughed.\n\n\u201cWell, really, Mamma! Why should you? What is there to be surprised at?\u201d\n\n\nIn the midst of the third \u00e9cossaise there was a clatter of chairs being pushed back in the sitting room where the count and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna had been playing cards with the majority of the more distinguished and older visitors. They now, stretching themselves after sitting so long, and replacing their purses and pocketbooks, entered the ballroom. First came M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna and the count, both with merry countenances. The count, with playful ceremony somewhat in ballet style, offered his bent arm to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. He drew himself up, a smile of debonair gallantry lit up his face and as soon as the last figure of the \u00e9cossaise was ended, he clapped his hands to the musicians and shouted up to their gallery, addressing the first violin:\n\n\u201cSem\u00ebn! Do you know the Daniel Cooper?\u201d\n\nThis was the count\u2019s favorite dance, which he had danced in his youth. (Strictly speaking, Daniel Cooper was one figure of the anglaise.)\n\n\u201cLook at Papa!\u201d shouted Nat\u00e1sha to the whole company, and quite forgetting that she was dancing with a grown-up partner she bent her curly head to her knees and made the whole room ring with her laughter.\n\nAnd indeed everybody in the room looked with a smile of pleasure at the jovial old gentleman, who standing beside his tall and stout partner, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, curved his arms, beat time, straightened his shoulders, turned out his toes, tapped gently with his foot, and, by a smile that broadened his round face more and more, prepared the onlookers for what was to follow. As soon as the provocatively gay strains of Daniel Cooper (somewhat resembling those of a merry peasant dance) began to sound, all the doorways of the ballroom were suddenly filled by the domestic serfs\u2014the men on one side and the women on the other\u2014who with beaming faces had come to see their master making merry.\n\n\u201cJust look at the master! A regular eagle he is!\u201d loudly remarked the nurse, as she stood in one of the doorways.\n\nThe count danced well and knew it. But his partner could not and did not want to dance well. Her enormous figure stood erect, her powerful arms hanging down (she had handed her reticule to the countess), and only her stern but handsome face really joined in the dance. What was expressed by the whole of the count\u2019s plump figure, in M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna found expression only in her more and more beaming face and quivering nose. But if the count, getting more and more into the swing of it, charmed the spectators by the unexpectedness of his adroit maneuvers and the agility with which he capered about on his light feet, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna produced no less impression by slight exertions\u2014the least effort to move her shoulders or bend her arms when turning, or stamp her foot\u2014which everyone appreciated in view of her size and habitual severity. The dance grew livelier and livelier. The other couples could not attract a moment\u2019s attention to their own evolutions and did not even try to do so. All were watching the count and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. Nat\u00e1sha kept pulling everyone by sleeve or dress, urging them to \u201clook at Papa!\u201d though as it was they never took their eyes off the couple. In the intervals of the dance the count, breathing deeply, waved and shouted to the musicians to play faster. Faster, faster, and faster; lightly, more lightly, and yet more lightly whirled the count, flying round M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, now on his toes, now on his heels; until, turning his partner round to her seat, he executed the final pas, raising his soft foot backwards, bowing his perspiring head, smiling and making a wide sweep with his arm, amid a thunder of applause and laughter led by Nat\u00e1sha. Both partners stood still, breathing heavily and wiping their faces with their cambric handkerchiefs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how we used to dance in our time, ma ch\u00e8re,\u201d said the count.\n\n\u201cThat was a Daniel Cooper!\u201d exclaimed M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, tucking up her sleeves and puffing heavily.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nWhile in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 ballroom the sixth anglaise was being danced, to a tune in which the weary musicians blundered, and while tired footmen and cooks were getting the supper, Count Bez\u00fakhov had a sixth stroke. The doctors pronounced recovery impossible. After a mute confession, communion was administered to the dying man, preparations made for the sacrament of unction, and in his house there was the bustle and thrill of suspense usual at such moments. Outside the house, beyond the gates, a group of undertakers, who hid whenever a carriage drove up, waited in expectation of an important order for an expensive funeral. The Military Governor of Moscow, who had been assiduous in sending aides-de-camp to inquire after the count\u2019s health, came himself that evening to bid a last farewell to the celebrated grandee of Catherine\u2019s court, Count Bez\u00fakhov.\n\nThe magnificent reception room was crowded. Everyone stood up respectfully when the Military Governor, having stayed about half an hour alone with the dying man, passed out, slightly acknowledging their bows and trying to escape as quickly as possible from the glances fixed on him by the doctors, clergy, and relatives of the family. Prince Vas\u00edli, who had grown thinner and paler during the last few days, escorted him to the door, repeating something to him several times in low tones.\n\nWhen the Military Governor had gone, Prince Vas\u00edli sat down all alone on a chair in the ballroom, crossing one leg high over the other, leaning his elbow on his knee and covering his face with his hand. After sitting so for a while he rose, and, looking about him with frightened eyes, went with unusually hurried steps down the long corridor leading to the back of the house, to the room of the eldest princess.\n\nThose who were in the dimly lit reception room spoke in nervous whispers, and, whenever anyone went into or came from the dying man\u2019s room, grew silent and gazed with eyes full of curiosity or expectancy at his door, which creaked slightly when opened.\n\n\u201cThe limits of human life ... are fixed and may not be o\u2019erpassed,\u201d said an old priest to a lady who had taken a seat beside him and was listening na\u00efvely to his words.\n\n\u201cI wonder, is it not too late to administer unction?\u201d asked the lady, adding the priest\u2019s clerical title, as if she had no opinion of her own on the subject.\n\n\u201cAh, madam, it is a great sacrament,\u201d replied the priest, passing his hand over the thin grizzled strands of hair combed back across his bald head.\n\n\u201cWho was that? The Military Governor himself?\u201d was being asked at the other side of the room. \u201cHow young-looking he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and he is over sixty. I hear the count no longer recognizes anyone. They wished to administer the sacrament of unction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew someone who received that sacrament seven times.\u201d\n\nThe second princess had just come from the sickroom with her eyes red from weeping and sat down beside Dr. Lorrain, who was sitting in a graceful pose under a portrait of Catherine, leaning his elbow on a table.\n\n\u201cBeautiful,\u201d said the doctor in answer to a remark about the weather. \u201cThe weather is beautiful, Princess; and besides, in Moscow one feels as if one were in the country.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, indeed,\u201d replied the princess with a sigh. \u201cSo he may have something to drink?\u201d\n\nLorrain considered.\n\n\u201cHas he taken his medicine?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\nThe doctor glanced at his watch.\n\n\u201cTake a glass of boiled water and put a pinch of cream of tartar,\u201d and he indicated with his delicate fingers what he meant by a pinch.\n\n\u201cDere has neffer been a gase,\u201d a German doctor was saying to an aide-de-camp, \u201cdat one liffs after de sird stroke.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what a well-preserved man he was!\u201d remarked the aide-de-camp. \u201cAnd who will inherit his wealth?\u201d he added in a whisper.\n\n\u201cIt von\u2019t go begging,\u201d replied the German with a smile.\n\nEveryone again looked toward the door, which creaked as the second princess went in with the drink she had prepared according to Lorrain\u2019s instructions. The German doctor went up to Lorrain.\n\n\u201cDo you think he can last till morning?\u201d asked the German, addressing Lorrain in French which he pronounced badly.\n\nLorrain, pursing up his lips, waved a severely negative finger before his nose.\n\n\u201cTonight, not later,\u201d said he in a low voice, and he moved away with a decorous smile of self-satisfaction at being able clearly to understand and state the patient\u2019s condition.\n\nMeanwhile Prince Vas\u00edli had opened the door into the princess\u2019 room.\n\nIn this room it was almost dark; only two tiny lamps were burning before the icons and there was a pleasant scent of flowers and burnt pastilles. The room was crowded with small pieces of furniture, whatnots, cupboards, and little tables. The quilt of a high, white feather bed was just visible behind a screen. A small dog began to bark.\n\n\u201cAh, is it you, cousin?\u201d\n\nShe rose and smoothed her hair, which was as usual so extremely smooth that it seemed to be made of one piece with her head and covered with varnish.\n\n\u201cHas anything happened?\u201d she asked. \u201cI am so terrified.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, there is no change. I only came to have a talk about business, Catiche,\u201d muttered the prince, seating himself wearily on the chair she had just vacated. \u201cYou have made the place warm, I must say,\u201d he remarked. \u201cWell, sit down: let\u2019s have a talk.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought perhaps something had happened,\u201d she said with her unchanging stonily severe expression; and, sitting down opposite the prince, she prepared to listen.\n\n\u201cI wished to get a nap, mon cousin, but I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my dear?\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli, taking her hand and bending it downwards as was his habit.\n\nIt was plain that this \u201cwell?\u201d referred to much that they both understood without naming.\n\nThe princess, who had a straight, rigid body, abnormally long for her legs, looked directly at Prince Vas\u00edli with no sign of emotion in her prominent gray eyes. Then she shook her head and glanced up at the icons with a sigh. This might have been taken as an expression of sorrow and devotion, or of weariness and hope of resting before long. Prince Vas\u00edli understood it as an expression of weariness.\n\n\u201cAnd I?\u201d he said; \u201cdo you think it is easier for me? I am as worn out as a post horse, but still I must have a talk with you, Catiche, a very serious talk.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli said no more and his cheeks began to twitch nervously, now on one side, now on the other, giving his face an unpleasant expression which was never to be seen on it in a drawing room. His eyes too seemed strange; at one moment they looked impudently sly and at the next glanced round in alarm.\n\nThe princess, holding her little dog on her lap with her thin bony hands, looked attentively into Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s eyes evidently resolved not to be the first to break silence, if she had to wait till morning.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, my dear princess and cousin, Catherine Sem\u00ebnovna,\u201d continued Prince Vas\u00edli, returning to his theme, apparently not without an inner struggle; \u201cat such a moment as this one must think of everything. One must think of the future, of all of you... I love you all, like children of my own, as you know.\u201d\n\nThe princess continued to look at him without moving, and with the same dull expression.\n\n\u201cAnd then of course my family has also to be considered,\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli went on, testily pushing away a little table without looking at her. \u201cYou know, Catiche, that we\u2014you three sisters, M\u00e1montov, and my wife\u2014are the count\u2019s only direct heirs. I know, I know how hard it is for you to talk or think of such matters. It is no easier for me; but, my dear, I am getting on for sixty and must be prepared for anything. Do you know I have sent for Pierre? The count,\u201d pointing to his portrait, \u201cdefinitely demanded that he should be called.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli looked questioningly at the princess, but could not make out whether she was considering what he had just said or whether she was simply looking at him.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing I constantly pray God to grant, mon cousin,\u201d she replied, \u201cand it is that He would be merciful to him and would allow his noble soul peacefully to leave this...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, of course,\u201d interrupted Prince Vas\u00edli impatiently, rubbing his bald head and angrily pulling back toward him the little table that he had pushed away. \u201cBut... in short, the fact is... you know yourself that last winter the count made a will by which he left all his property, not to us his direct heirs, but to Pierre.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has made wills enough!\u201d quietly remarked the princess. \u201cBut he cannot leave the estate to Pierre. Pierre is illegitimate.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli suddenly, clutching the little table and becoming more animated and talking more rapidly: \u201cwhat if a letter has been written to the Emperor in which the count asks for Pierre\u2019s legitimation? Do you understand that in consideration of the count\u2019s services, his request would be granted?...\u201d\n\nThe princess smiled as people do who think they know more about the subject under discussion than those they are talking with.\n\n\u201cI can tell you more,\u201d continued Prince Vas\u00edli, seizing her hand, \u201cthat letter was written, though it was not sent, and the Emperor knew of it. The only question is, has it been destroyed or not? If not, then as soon as all is over,\u201d and Prince Vas\u00edli sighed to intimate what he meant by the words all is over, \u201cand the count\u2019s papers are opened, the will and letter will be delivered to the Emperor, and the petition will certainly be granted. Pierre will get everything as the legitimate son.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd our share?\u201d asked the princess smiling ironically, as if anything might happen, only not that.\n\n\u201cBut, my poor Catiche, it is as clear as daylight! He will then be the legal heir to everything and you won\u2019t get anything. You must know, my dear, whether the will and letter were written, and whether they have been destroyed or not. And if they have somehow been overlooked, you ought to know where they are, and must find them, because...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat next?\u201d the princess interrupted, smiling sardonically and not changing the expression of her eyes. \u201cI am a woman, and you think we are all stupid; but I know this: an illegitimate son cannot inherit... un b\u00e2tard!\u201d she added, as if supposing that this translation of the word would effectively prove to Prince Vas\u00edli the invalidity of his contention.\n\n\u201cWell, really, Catiche! Can\u2019t you understand! You are so intelligent, how is it you don\u2019t see that if the count has written a letter to the Emperor begging him to recognize Pierre as legitimate, it follows that Pierre will not be Pierre but will become Count Bez\u00fakhov, and will then inherit everything under the will? And if the will and letter are not destroyed, then you will have nothing but the consolation of having been dutiful et tout ce qui s\u2019ensuit! That\u2019s certain.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know the will was made, but I also know that it is invalid; and you, mon cousin, seem to consider me a perfect fool,\u201d said the princess with the expression women assume when they suppose they are saying something witty and stinging.\n\n\u201cMy dear Princess Catherine Sem\u00ebnovna,\u201d began Prince Vas\u00edli impatiently, \u201cI came here not to wrangle with you, but to talk about your interests as with a kinswoman, a good, kind, true relation. And I tell you for the tenth time that if the letter to the Emperor and the will in Pierre\u2019s favor are among the count\u2019s papers, then, my dear girl, you and your sisters are not heiresses! If you don\u2019t believe me, then believe an expert. I have just been talking to Dm\u00edtri On\u00fafrich\u201d (the family solicitor) \u201cand he says the same.\u201d\n\nAt this a sudden change evidently took place in the princess\u2019 ideas; her thin lips grew white, though her eyes did not change, and her voice when she began to speak passed through such transitions as she herself evidently did not expect.\n\n\u201cThat would be a fine thing!\u201d said she. \u201cI never wanted anything and I don\u2019t now.\u201d\n\nShe pushed the little dog off her lap and smoothed her dress.\n\n\u201cAnd this is gratitude\u2014this is recognition for those who have sacrificed everything for his sake!\u201d she cried. \u201cIt\u2019s splendid! Fine! I don\u2019t want anything, Prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but you are not the only one. There are your sisters...\u201d replied Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\nBut the princess did not listen to him.\n\n\u201cYes, I knew it long ago but had forgotten. I knew that I could expect nothing but meanness, deceit, envy, intrigue, and ingratitude\u2014the blackest ingratitude\u2014in this house...\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you or do you not know where that will is?\u201d insisted Prince Vas\u00edli, his cheeks twitching more than ever.\n\n\u201cYes, I was a fool! I still believed in people, loved them, and sacrificed myself. But only the base, the vile succeed! I know who has been intriguing!\u201d\n\nThe princess wished to rise, but the prince held her by the hand. She had the air of one who has suddenly lost faith in the whole human race. She gave her companion an angry glance.\n\n\u201cThere is still time, my dear. You must remember, Catiche, that it was all done casually in a moment of anger, of illness, and was afterwards forgotten. Our duty, my dear, is to rectify his mistake, to ease his last moments by not letting him commit this injustice, and not to let him die feeling that he is rendering unhappy those who...\u201d\n\n\u201cWho sacrificed everything for him,\u201d chimed in the princess, who would again have risen had not the prince still held her fast, \u201cthough he never could appreciate it. No, mon cousin,\u201d she added with a sigh, \u201cI shall always remember that in this world one must expect no reward, that in this world there is neither honor nor justice. In this world one has to be cunning and cruel.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow come, come! Be reasonable. I know your excellent heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I have a wicked heart.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know your heart,\u201d repeated the prince. \u201cI value your friendship and wish you to have as good an opinion of me. Don\u2019t upset yourself, and let us talk sensibly while there is still time, be it a day or be it but an hour.... Tell me all you know about the will, and above all where it is. You must know. We will take it at once and show it to the count. He has, no doubt, forgotten it and will wish to destroy it. You understand that my sole desire is conscientiously to carry out his wishes; that is my only reason for being here. I came simply to help him and you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I see it all! I know who has been intriguing\u2014I know!\u201d cried the princess.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of yours, that sweet Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya, that Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna whom I would not take for a housemaid... the infamous, vile woman!\u201d\n\n\u201cDo not let us lose any time...\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, don\u2019t talk to me! Last winter she wheedled herself in here and told the count such vile, disgraceful things about us, especially about Sophie\u2014I can\u2019t repeat them\u2014that it made the count quite ill and he would not see us for a whole fortnight. I know it was then he wrote this vile, infamous paper, but I thought the thing was invalid.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got to it at last\u2014why did you not tell me about it sooner?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the inlaid portfolio that he keeps under his pillow,\u201d said the princess, ignoring his question. \u201cNow I know! Yes; if I have a sin, a great sin, it is hatred of that vile woman!\u201d almost shrieked the princess, now quite changed. \u201cAnd what does she come worming herself in here for? But I will give her a piece of my mind. The time will come!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nWhile these conversations were going on in the reception room and the princess\u2019 room, a carriage containing Pierre (who had been sent for) and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna (who found it necessary to accompany him) was driving into the court of Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s house. As the wheels rolled softly over the straw beneath the windows, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, having turned with words of comfort to her companion, realized that he was asleep in his corner and woke him up. Rousing himself, Pierre followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna out of the carriage, and only then began to think of the interview with his dying father which awaited him. He noticed that they had not come to the front entrance but to the back door. While he was getting down from the carriage steps two men, who looked like tradespeople, ran hurriedly from the entrance and hid in the shadow of the wall. Pausing for a moment, Pierre noticed several other men of the same kind hiding in the shadow of the house on both sides. But neither Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna nor the footman nor the coachman, who could not help seeing these people, took any notice of them. \u201cIt seems to be all right,\u201d Pierre concluded, and followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. She hurriedly ascended the narrow dimly lit stone staircase, calling to Pierre, who was lagging behind, to follow. Though he did not see why it was necessary for him to go to the count at all, still less why he had to go by the back stairs, yet judging by Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s air of assurance and haste, Pierre concluded that it was all absolutely necessary. Halfway up the stairs they were almost knocked over by some men who, carrying pails, came running downstairs, their boots clattering. These men pressed close to the wall to let Pierre and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna pass and did not evince the least surprise at seeing them there.\n\n\u201cIs this the way to the princesses\u2019 apartments?\u201d asked Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna of one of them.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied a footman in a bold loud voice, as if anything were now permissible; \u201cthe door to the left, ma\u2019am.\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the count did not ask for me,\u201d said Pierre when he reached the landing. \u201cI\u2019d better go to my own room.\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna paused and waited for him to come up.\n\n\u201cAh, my friend!\u201d she said, touching his arm as she had done her son\u2019s when speaking to him that afternoon, \u201cbelieve me I suffer no less than you do, but be a man!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut really, hadn\u2019t I better go away?\u201d he asked, looking kindly at her over his spectacles.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear friend! Forget the wrongs that may have been done you. Think that he is your father ... perhaps in the agony of death.\u201d She sighed. \u201cI have loved you like a son from the first. Trust yourself to me, Pierre. I shall not forget your interests.\u201d\n\nPierre did not understand a word, but the conviction that all this had to be grew stronger, and he meekly followed Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna who was already opening a door.\n\nThis door led into a back anteroom. An old man, a servant of the princesses, sat in a corner knitting a stocking. Pierre had never been in this part of the house and did not even know of the existence of these rooms. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, addressing a maid who was hurrying past with a decanter on a tray as \u201cmy dear\u201d and \u201cmy sweet,\u201d asked about the princess\u2019 health and then led Pierre along a stone passage. The first door on the left led into the princesses\u2019 apartments. The maid with the decanter in her haste had not closed the door (everything in the house was done in haste at that time), and Pierre and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna in passing instinctively glanced into the room, where Prince Vas\u00edli and the eldest princess were sitting close together talking. Seeing them pass, Prince Vas\u00edli drew back with obvious impatience, while the princess jumped up and with a gesture of desperation slammed the door with all her might.\n\nThis action was so unlike her usual composure and the fear depicted on Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s face so out of keeping with his dignity that Pierre stopped and glanced inquiringly over his spectacles at his guide. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna evinced no surprise, she only smiled faintly and sighed, as if to say that this was no more than she had expected.\n\n\u201cBe a man, my friend. I will look after your interests,\u201d said she in reply to his look, and went still faster along the passage.\n\nPierre could not make out what it was all about, and still less what \u201cwatching over his interests\u201d meant, but he decided that all these things had to be. From the passage they went into a large, dimly lit room adjoining the count\u2019s reception room. It was one of those sumptuous but cold apartments known to Pierre only from the front approach, but even in this room there now stood an empty bath, and water had been spilled on the carpet. They were met by a deacon with a censer and by a servant who passed out on tiptoe without heeding them. They went into the reception room familiar to Pierre, with two Italian windows opening into the conservatory, with its large bust and full length portrait of Catherine the Great. The same people were still sitting here in almost the same positions as before, whispering to one another. All became silent and turned to look at the pale tear-worn Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna as she entered, and at the big stout figure of Pierre who, hanging his head, meekly followed her.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s face expressed a consciousness that the decisive moment had arrived. With the air of a practical Petersburg lady she now, keeping Pierre close beside her, entered the room even more boldly than that afternoon. She felt that as she brought with her the person the dying man wished to see, her own admission was assured. Casting a rapid glance at all those in the room and noticing the count\u2019s confessor there, she glided up to him with a sort of amble, not exactly bowing yet seeming to grow suddenly smaller, and respectfully received the blessing first of one and then of another priest.\n\n\u201cGod be thanked that you are in time,\u201d said she to one of the priests; \u201call we relatives have been in such anxiety. This young man is the count\u2019s son,\u201d she added more softly. \u201cWhat a terrible moment!\u201d\n\nHaving said this she went up to the doctor.\n\n\u201cDear doctor,\u201d said she, \u201cthis young man is the count\u2019s son. Is there any hope?\u201d\n\nThe doctor cast a rapid glance upwards and silently shrugged his shoulders. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with just the same movement raised her shoulders and eyes, almost closing the latter, sighed, and moved away from the doctor to Pierre. To him, in a particularly respectful and tenderly sad voice, she said:\n\n\u201cTrust in His mercy!\u201d and pointing out a small sofa for him to sit and wait for her, she went silently toward the door that everyone was watching and it creaked very slightly as she disappeared behind it.\n\nPierre, having made up his mind to obey his monitress implicitly, moved toward the sofa she had indicated. As soon as Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna had disappeared he noticed that the eyes of all in the room turned to him with something more than curiosity and sympathy. He noticed that they whispered to one another, casting significant looks at him with a kind of awe and even servility. A deference such as he had never before received was shown him. A strange lady, the one who had been talking to the priests, rose and offered him her seat; an aide-de-camp picked up and returned a glove Pierre had dropped; the doctors became respectfully silent as he passed by, and moved to make way for him. At first Pierre wished to take another seat so as not to trouble the lady, and also to pick up the glove himself and to pass round the doctors who were not even in his way; but all at once he felt that this would not do, and that tonight he was a person obliged to perform some sort of awful rite which everyone expected of him, and that he was therefore bound to accept their services. He took the glove in silence from the aide-de-camp, and sat down in the lady\u2019s chair, placing his huge hands symmetrically on his knees in the na\u00efve attitude of an Egyptian statue, and decided in his own mind that all was as it should be, and that in order not to lose his head and do foolish things he must not act on his own ideas tonight, but must yield himself up entirely to the will of those who were guiding him.\n\nNot two minutes had passed before Prince Vas\u00edli with head erect majestically entered the room. He was wearing his long coat with three stars on his breast. He seemed to have grown thinner since the morning; his eyes seemed larger than usual when he glanced round and noticed Pierre. He went up to him, took his hand (a thing he never used to do), and drew it downwards as if wishing to ascertain whether it was firmly fixed on.\n\n\u201cCourage, courage, my friend! He has asked to see you. That is well!\u201d and he turned to go.\n\nBut Pierre thought it necessary to ask: \u201cHow is...\u201d and hesitated, not knowing whether it would be proper to call the dying man \u201cthe count,\u201d yet ashamed to call him \u201cfather.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had another stroke about half an hour ago. Courage, my friend...\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s mind was in such a confused state that the word \u201cstroke\u201d suggested to him a blow from something. He looked at Prince Vas\u00edli in perplexity, and only later grasped that a stroke was an attack of illness. Prince Vas\u00edli said something to Lorrain in passing and went through the door on tiptoe. He could not walk well on tiptoe and his whole body jerked at each step. The eldest princess followed him, and the priests and deacons and some servants also went in at the door. Through that door was heard a noise of things being moved about, and at last Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, still with the same expression, pale but resolute in the discharge of duty, ran out and touching Pierre lightly on the arm said:\n\n\u201cThe divine mercy is inexhaustible! Unction is about to be administered. Come.\u201d\n\nPierre went in at the door, stepping on the soft carpet, and noticed that the strange lady, the aide-de-camp, and some of the servants, all followed him in, as if there were now no further need for permission to enter that room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nPierre well knew this large room divided by columns and an arch, its walls hung round with Persian carpets. The part of the room behind the columns, with a high silk-curtained mahogany bedstead on one side and on the other an immense case containing icons, was brightly illuminated with red light like a Russian church during evening service. Under the gleaming icons stood a long invalid chair, and in that chair on snowy-white smooth pillows, evidently freshly changed, Pierre saw\u2014covered to the waist by a bright green quilt\u2014the familiar, majestic figure of his father, Count Bez\u00fakhov, with that gray mane of hair above his broad forehead which reminded one of a lion, and the deep characteristically noble wrinkles of his handsome, ruddy face. He lay just under the icons; his large thick hands outside the quilt. Into the right hand, which was lying palm downwards, a wax taper had been thrust between forefinger and thumb, and an old servant, bending over from behind the chair, held it in position. By the chair stood the priests, their long hair falling over their magnificent glittering vestments, with lighted tapers in their hands, slowly and solemnly conducting the service. A little behind them stood the two younger princesses holding handkerchiefs to their eyes, and just in front of them their eldest sister, Catiche, with a vicious and determined look steadily fixed on the icons, as though declaring to all that she could not answer for herself should she glance round. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with a meek, sorrowful, and all-forgiving expression on her face, stood by the door near the strange lady. Prince Vas\u00edli in front of the door, near the invalid chair, a wax taper in his left hand, was leaning his left arm on the carved back of a velvet chair he had turned round for the purpose, and was crossing himself with his right hand, turning his eyes upward each time he touched his forehead. His face wore a calm look of piety and resignation to the will of God. \u201cIf you do not understand these sentiments,\u201d he seemed to be saying, \u201cso much the worse for you!\u201d\n\nBehind him stood the aide-de-camp, the doctors, and the menservants; the men and women had separated as in church. All were silently crossing themselves, and the reading of the church service, the subdued chanting of deep bass voices, and in the intervals sighs and the shuffling of feet were the only sounds that could be heard. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with an air of importance that showed that she felt she quite knew what she was about, went across the room to where Pierre was standing and gave him a taper. He lit it and, distracted by observing those around him, began crossing himself with the hand that held the taper.\n\nSophie, the rosy, laughter-loving, youngest princess with the mole, watched him. She smiled, hid her face in her handkerchief, and remained with it hidden for awhile; then looking up and seeing Pierre she again began to laugh. She evidently felt unable to look at him without laughing, but could not resist looking at him: so to be out of temptation she slipped quietly behind one of the columns. In the midst of the service the voices of the priests suddenly ceased, they whispered to one another, and the old servant who was holding the count\u2019s hand got up and said something to the ladies. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna stepped forward and, stooping over the dying man, beckoned to Lorrain from behind her back. The French doctor held no taper; he was leaning against one of the columns in a respectful attitude implying that he, a foreigner, in spite of all differences of faith, understood the full importance of the rite now being performed and even approved of it. He now approached the sick man with the noiseless step of one in full vigor of life, with his delicate white fingers raised from the green quilt the hand that was free, and turning sideways felt the pulse and reflected a moment. The sick man was given something to drink, there was a stir around him, then the people resumed their places and the service continued. During this interval Pierre noticed that Prince Vas\u00edli left the chair on which he had been leaning, and\u2014with an air which intimated that he knew what he was about and if others did not understand him it was so much the worse for them\u2014did not go up to the dying man, but passed by him, joined the eldest princess, and moved with her to the side of the room where stood the high bedstead with its silken hangings. On leaving the bed both Prince Vas\u00edli and the princess passed out by a back door, but returned to their places one after the other before the service was concluded. Pierre paid no more attention to this occurrence than to the rest of what went on, having made up his mind once for all that what he saw happening around him that evening was in some way essential.\n\nThe chanting of the service ceased, and the voice of the priest was heard respectfully congratulating the dying man on having received the sacrament. The dying man lay as lifeless and immovable as before. Around him everyone began to stir: steps were audible and whispers, among which Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s was the most distinct.\n\nPierre heard her say:\n\n\u201cCertainly he must be moved onto the bed; here it will be impossible...\u201d\n\nThe sick man was so surrounded by doctors, princesses, and servants that Pierre could no longer see the reddish-yellow face with its gray mane\u2014which, though he saw other faces as well, he had not lost sight of for a single moment during the whole service. He judged by the cautious movements of those who crowded round the invalid chair that they had lifted the dying man and were moving him.\n\n\u201cCatch hold of my arm or you\u2019ll drop him!\u201d he heard one of the servants say in a frightened whisper. \u201cCatch hold from underneath. Here!\u201d exclaimed different voices; and the heavy breathing of the bearers and the shuffling of their feet grew more hurried, as if the weight they were carrying were too much for them.\n\nAs the bearers, among whom was Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, passed the young man he caught a momentary glimpse between their heads and backs of the dying man\u2019s high, stout, uncovered chest and powerful shoulders, raised by those who were holding him under the armpits, and of his gray, curly, leonine head. This head, with its remarkably broad brow and cheekbones, its handsome, sensual mouth, and its cold, majestic expression, was not disfigured by the approach of death. It was the same as Pierre remembered it three months before, when the count had sent him to Petersburg. But now this head was swaying helplessly with the uneven movements of the bearers, and the cold listless gaze fixed itself upon nothing.\n\nAfter a few minutes\u2019 bustle beside the high bedstead, those who had carried the sick man dispersed. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna touched Pierre\u2019s hand and said, \u201cCome.\u201d Pierre", "sequence": 1}, {"offset": 200000, "text": " went with her to the bed on which the sick man had been laid in a stately pose in keeping with the ceremony just completed. He lay with his head propped high on the pillows. His hands were symmetrically placed on the green silk quilt, the palms downward. When Pierre came up the count was gazing straight at him, but with a look the significance of which could not be understood by mortal man. Either this look meant nothing but that as long as one has eyes they must look somewhere, or it meant too much. Pierre hesitated, not knowing what to do, and glanced inquiringly at his guide. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna made a hurried sign with her eyes, glancing at the sick man\u2019s hand and moving her lips as if to send it a kiss. Pierre, carefully stretching his neck so as not to touch the quilt, followed her suggestion and pressed his lips to the large boned, fleshy hand. Neither the hand nor a single muscle of the count\u2019s face stirred. Once more Pierre looked questioningly at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna to see what he was to do next. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna with her eyes indicated a chair that stood beside the bed. Pierre obediently sat down, his eyes asking if he were doing right. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna nodded approvingly. Again Pierre fell into the na\u00efvely symmetrical pose of an Egyptian statue, evidently distressed that his stout and clumsy body took up so much room and doing his utmost to look as small as possible. He looked at the count, who still gazed at the spot where Pierre\u2019s face had been before he sat down. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna indicated by her attitude her consciousness of the pathetic importance of these last moments of meeting between the father and son. This lasted about two minutes, which to Pierre seemed an hour. Suddenly the broad muscles and lines of the count\u2019s face began to twitch. The twitching increased, the handsome mouth was drawn to one side (only now did Pierre realize how near death his father was), and from that distorted mouth issued an indistinct, hoarse sound. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna looked attentively at the sick man\u2019s eyes, trying to guess what he wanted; she pointed first to Pierre, then to some drink, then named Prince Vas\u00edli in an inquiring whisper, then pointed to the quilt. The eyes and face of the sick man showed impatience. He made an effort to look at the servant who stood constantly at the head of the bed.\n\n\u201cWants to turn on the other side,\u201d whispered the servant, and got up to turn the count\u2019s heavy body toward the wall.\n\nPierre rose to help him.\n\nWhile the count was being turned over, one of his arms fell back helplessly and he made a fruitless effort to pull it forward. Whether he noticed the look of terror with which Pierre regarded that lifeless arm, or whether some other thought flitted across his dying brain, at any rate he glanced at the refractory arm, at Pierre\u2019s terror-stricken face, and again at the arm, and on his face a feeble, piteous smile appeared, quite out of keeping with his features, that seemed to deride his own helplessness. At sight of this smile Pierre felt an unexpected quivering in his breast and a tickling in his nose, and tears dimmed his eyes. The sick man was turned on to his side with his face to the wall. He sighed.\n\n\u201cHe is dozing,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, observing that one of the princesses was coming to take her turn at watching. \u201cLet us go.\u201d\n\nPierre went out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nThere was now no one in the reception room except Prince Vas\u00edli and the eldest princess, who were sitting under the portrait of Catherine the Great and talking eagerly. As soon as they saw Pierre and his companion they became silent, and Pierre thought he saw the princess hide something as she whispered:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t bear the sight of that woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cCatiche has had tea served in the small drawing room,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. \u201cGo and take something, my poor Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, or you will not hold out.\u201d\n\nTo Pierre he said nothing, merely giving his arm a sympathetic squeeze below the shoulder. Pierre went with Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna into the small drawing room.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing so refreshing after a sleepless night as a cup of this delicious Russian tea,\u201d Lorrain was saying with an air of restrained animation as he stood sipping tea from a delicate Chinese handleless cup before a table on which tea and a cold supper were laid in the small circular room. Around the table all who were at Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s house that night had gathered to fortify themselves. Pierre well remembered this small circular drawing room with its mirrors and little tables. During balls given at the house Pierre, who did not know how to dance, had liked sitting in this room to watch the ladies who, as they passed through in their ball dresses with diamonds and pearls on their bare shoulders, looked at themselves in the brilliantly lighted mirrors which repeated their reflections several times. Now this same room was dimly lighted by two candles. On one small table tea things and supper dishes stood in disorder, and in the middle of the night a motley throng of people sat there, not merrymaking, but somberly whispering, and betraying by every word and movement that they none of them forgot what was happening and what was about to happen in the bedroom. Pierre did not eat anything though he would very much have liked to. He looked inquiringly at his monitress and saw that she was again going on tiptoe to the reception room where they had left Prince Vas\u00edli and the eldest princess. Pierre concluded that this also was essential, and after a short interval followed her. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna was standing beside the princess, and they were both speaking in excited whispers.\n\n\u201cPermit me, Princess, to know what is necessary and what is not necessary,\u201d said the younger of the two speakers, evidently in the same state of excitement as when she had slammed the door of her room.\n\n\u201cBut, my dear princess,\u201d answered Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna blandly but impressively, blocking the way to the bedroom and preventing the other from passing, \u201cwon\u2019t this be too much for poor Uncle at a moment when he needs repose? Worldly conversation at a moment when his soul is already prepared...\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli was seated in an easy chair in his familiar attitude, with one leg crossed high above the other. His cheeks, which were so flabby that they looked heavier below, were twitching violently; but he wore the air of a man little concerned in what the two ladies were saying.\n\n\u201cCome, my dear Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, let Catiche do as she pleases. You know how fond the count is of her.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know what is in this paper,\u201d said the younger of the two ladies, addressing Prince Vas\u00edli and pointing to an inlaid portfolio she held in her hand. \u201cAll I know is that his real will is in his writing table, and this is a paper he has forgotten....\u201d\n\nShe tried to pass Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, but the latter sprang so as to bar her path.\n\n\u201cI know, my dear, kind princess,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, seizing the portfolio so firmly that it was plain she would not let go easily. \u201cDear princess, I beg and implore you, have some pity on him! Je vous en conjure...\u201d\n\nThe princess did not reply. Their efforts in the struggle for the portfolio were the only sounds audible, but it was evident that if the princess did speak, her words would not be flattering to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. Though the latter held on tenaciously, her voice lost none of its honeyed firmness and softness.\n\n\u201cPierre, my dear, come here. I think he will not be out of place in a family consultation; is it not so, Prince?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak, cousin?\u201d suddenly shrieked the princess so loud that those in the drawing room heard her and were startled. \u201cWhy do you remain silent when heaven knows who permits herself to interfere, making a scene on the very threshold of a dying man\u2019s room? Intriguer!\u201d she hissed viciously, and tugged with all her might at the portfolio.\n\nBut Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna went forward a step or two to keep her hold on the portfolio, and changed her grip.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli rose. \u201cOh!\u201d said he with reproach and surprise, \u201cthis is absurd! Come, let go I tell you.\u201d\n\nThe princess let go.\n\n\u201cAnd you too!\u201d\n\nBut Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna did not obey him.\n\n\u201cLet go, I tell you! I will take the responsibility. I myself will go and ask him, I!... does that satisfy you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Prince,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, \u201cafter such a solemn sacrament, allow him a moment\u2019s peace! Here, Pierre, tell them your opinion,\u201d said she, turning to the young man who, having come quite close, was gazing with astonishment at the angry face of the princess which had lost all dignity, and at the twitching cheeks of Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cRemember that you will answer for the consequences,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli severely. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what you are doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cVile woman!\u201d shouted the princess, darting unexpectedly at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and snatching the portfolio from her.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli bent his head and spread out his hands.\n\nAt this moment that terrible door, which Pierre had watched so long and which had always opened so quietly, burst noisily open and banged against the wall, and the second of the three sisters rushed out wringing her hands.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing!\u201d she cried vehemently. \u201cHe is dying and you leave me alone with him!\u201d\n\nHer sister dropped the portfolio. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, stooping, quickly caught up the object of contention and ran into the bedroom. The eldest princess and Prince Vas\u00edli, recovering themselves, followed her. A few minutes later the eldest sister came out with a pale hard face, again biting her underlip. At sight of Pierre her expression showed an irrepressible hatred.\n\n\u201cYes, now you may be glad!\u201d said she; \u201cthis is what you have been waiting for.\u201d And bursting into tears she hid her face in her handkerchief and rushed from the room.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli came next. He staggered to the sofa on which Pierre was sitting and dropped onto it, covering his face with his hand. Pierre noticed that he was pale and that his jaw quivered and shook as if in an ague.\n\n\u201cAh, my friend!\u201d said he, taking Pierre by the elbow; and there was in his voice a sincerity and weakness Pierre had never observed in it before. \u201cHow often we sin, how much we deceive, and all for what? I am near sixty, dear friend... I too... All will end in death, all! Death is awful...\u201d and he burst into tears.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna came out last. She approached Pierre with slow, quiet steps.\n\n\u201cPierre!\u201d she said.\n\nPierre gave her an inquiring look. She kissed the young man on his forehead, wetting him with her tears. Then after a pause she said:\n\n\u201cHe is no more....\u201d\n\nPierre looked at her over his spectacles.\n\n\u201cCome, I will go with you. Try to weep, nothing gives such relief as tears.\u201d\n\nShe led him into the dark drawing room and Pierre was glad no one could see his face. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna left him, and when she returned he was fast asleep with his head on his arm.\n\nIn the morning Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna said to Pierre:\n\n\u201cYes, my dear, this is a great loss for us all, not to speak of you. But God will support you: you are young, and are now, I hope, in command of an immense fortune. The will has not yet been opened. I know you well enough to be sure that this will not turn your head, but it imposes duties on you, and you must be a man.\u201d\n\nPierre was silent.\n\n\u201cPerhaps later on I may tell you, my dear boy, that if I had not been there, God only knows what would have happened! You know, Uncle promised me only the day before yesterday not to forget Bor\u00eds. But he had no time. I hope, my dear friend, you will carry out your father\u2019s wish?\u201d\n\nPierre understood nothing of all this and coloring shyly looked in silence at Princess Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna. After her talk with Pierre, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna returned to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and went to bed. On waking in the morning she told the Rost\u00f3vs and all her acquaintances the details of Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s death. She said the count had died as she would herself wish to die, that his end was not only touching but edifying. As to the last meeting between father and son, it was so touching that she could not think of it without tears, and did not know which had behaved better during those awful moments\u2014the father who so remembered everything and everybody at last and had spoken such pathetic words to the son, or Pierre, whom it had been pitiful to see, so stricken was he with grief, though he tried hard to hide it in order not to sadden his dying father. \u201cIt is painful, but it does one good. It uplifts the soul to see such men as the old count and his worthy son,\u201d said she. Of the behavior of the eldest princess and Prince Vas\u00edli she spoke disapprovingly, but in whispers and as a great secret.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nAt Bald Hills, Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s estate, the arrival of young Prince Andrew and his wife was daily expected, but this expectation did not upset the regular routine of life in the old prince\u2019s household. General in Chief Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich (nicknamed in society, \u201cthe King of Prussia\u201d) ever since the Emperor Paul had exiled him to his country estate had lived there continuously with his daughter, Princess Mary, and her companion, Mademoiselle Bourienne. Though in the new reign he was free to return to the capitals, he still continued to live in the country, remarking that anyone who wanted to see him could come the hundred miles from Moscow to Bald Hills, while he himself needed no one and nothing. He used to say that there are only two sources of human vice\u2014idleness and superstition, and only two virtues\u2014activity and intelligence. He himself undertook his daughter\u2019s education, and to develop these two cardinal virtues in her gave her lessons in algebra and geometry till she was twenty, and arranged her life so that her whole time was occupied. He was himself always occupied: writing his memoirs, solving problems in higher mathematics, turning snuffboxes on a lathe, working in the garden, or superintending the building that was always going on at his estate. As regularity is a prime condition facilitating activity, regularity in his household was carried to the highest point of exactitude. He always came to table under precisely the same conditions, and not only at the same hour but at the same minute. With those about him, from his daughter to his serfs, the prince was sharp and invariably exacting, so that without being a hardhearted man he inspired such fear and respect as few hardhearted men would have aroused. Although he was in retirement and had now no influence in political affairs, every high official appointed to the province in which the prince\u2019s estate lay considered it his duty to visit him and waited in the lofty antechamber just as the architect, gardener, or Princess Mary did, till the prince appeared punctually to the appointed hour. Everyone sitting in this antechamber experienced the same feeling of respect and even fear when the enormously high study door opened and showed the figure of a rather small old man, with powdered wig, small withered hands, and bushy gray eyebrows which, when he frowned, sometimes hid the gleam of his shrewd, youthfully glittering eyes.\n\nOn the morning of the day that the young couple were to arrive, Princess Mary entered the antechamber as usual at the time appointed for the morning greeting, crossing herself with trepidation and repeating a silent prayer. Every morning she came in like that, and every morning prayed that the daily interview might pass off well.\n\nAn old powdered manservant who was sitting in the antechamber rose quietly and said in a whisper: \u201cPlease walk in.\u201d\n\nThrough the door came the regular hum of a lathe. The princess timidly opened the door which moved noiselessly and easily. She paused at the entrance. The prince was working at the lathe and after glancing round continued his work.\n\nThe enormous study was full of things evidently in constant use. The large table covered with books and plans, the tall glass-fronted bookcases with keys in the locks, the high desk for writing while standing up, on which lay an open exercise book, and the lathe with tools laid ready to hand and shavings scattered around\u2014all indicated continuous, varied, and orderly activity. The motion of the small foot shod in a Tartar boot embroidered with silver, and the firm pressure of the lean sinewy hand, showed that the prince still possessed the tenacious endurance and vigor of hardy old age. After a few more turns of the lathe he removed his foot from the pedal, wiped his chisel, dropped it into a leather pouch attached to the lathe, and, approaching the table, summoned his daughter. He never gave his children a blessing, so he simply held out his bristly cheek (as yet unshaven) and, regarding her tenderly and attentively, said severely:\n\n\u201cQuite well? All right then, sit down.\u201d He took the exercise book containing lessons in geometry written by himself and drew up a chair with his foot.\n\n\u201cFor tomorrow!\u201d said he, quickly finding the page and making a scratch from one paragraph to another with his hard nail.\n\nThe princess bent over the exercise book on the table.\n\n\u201cWait a bit, here\u2019s a letter for you,\u201d said the old man suddenly, taking a letter addressed in a woman\u2019s hand from a bag hanging above the table, onto which he threw it.\n\nAt the sight of the letter red patches showed themselves on the princess\u2019 face. She took it quickly and bent her head over it.\n\n\u201cFrom H\u00e9lo\u00efse?\u201d asked the prince with a cold smile that showed his still sound, yellowish teeth.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s from Julie,\u201d replied the princess with a timid glance and a timid smile.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll let two more letters pass, but the third I\u2019ll read,\u201d said the prince sternly; \u201cI\u2019m afraid you write much nonsense. I\u2019ll read the third!\u201d\n\n\u201cRead this if you like, Father,\u201d said the princess, blushing still more and holding out the letter.\n\n\u201cThe third, I said the third!\u201d cried the prince abruptly, pushing the letter away, and leaning his elbows on the table he drew toward him the exercise book containing geometrical figures.\n\n\u201cWell, madam,\u201d he began, stooping over the book close to his daughter and placing an arm on the back of the chair on which she sat, so that she felt herself surrounded on all sides by the acrid scent of old age and tobacco, which she had known so long. \u201cNow, madam, these triangles are equal; please note that the angle ABC...\u201d\n\nThe princess looked in a scared way at her father\u2019s eyes glittering close to her; the red patches on her face came and went, and it was plain that she understood nothing and was so frightened that her fear would prevent her understanding any of her father\u2019s further explanations, however clear they might be. Whether it was the teacher\u2019s fault or the pupil\u2019s, this same thing happened every day: the princess\u2019 eyes grew dim, she could not see and could not hear anything, but was only conscious of her stern father\u2019s withered face close to her, of his breath and the smell of him, and could think only of how to get away quickly to her own room to make out the problem in peace. The old man was beside himself: moved the chair on which he was sitting noisily backward and forward, made efforts to control himself and not become vehement, but almost always did become vehement, scolded, and sometimes flung the exercise book away.\n\nThe princess gave a wrong answer.\n\n\u201cWell now, isn\u2019t she a fool!\u201d shouted the prince, pushing the book aside and turning sharply away; but rising immediately, he paced up and down, lightly touched his daughter\u2019s hair and sat down again.\n\nHe drew up his chair, and continued to explain.\n\n\u201cThis won\u2019t do, Princess; it won\u2019t do,\u201d said he, when Princess Mary, having taken and closed the exercise book with the next day\u2019s lesson, was about to leave: \u201cMathematics are most important, madam! I don\u2019t want to have you like our silly ladies. Get used to it and you\u2019ll like it,\u201d and he patted her cheek. \u201cIt will drive all the nonsense out of your head.\u201d\n\nShe turned to go, but he stopped her with a gesture and took an uncut book from the high desk.\n\n\u201cHere is some sort of Key to the Mysteries that your H\u00e9lo\u00efse has sent you. Religious! I don\u2019t interfere with anyone\u2019s belief... I have looked at it. Take it. Well, now go. Go.\u201d\n\nHe patted her on the shoulder and himself closed the door after her.\n\nPrincess Mary went back to her room with the sad, scared expression that rarely left her and which made her plain, sickly face yet plainer. She sat down at her writing table, on which stood miniature portraits and which was littered with books and papers. The princess was as untidy as her father was tidy. She put down the geometry book and eagerly broke the seal of her letter. It was from her most intimate friend from childhood; that same Julie Kar\u00e1gina who had been at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 name-day party.\n\nJulie wrote in French:\n\nDear and precious Friend, How terrible and frightful a thing is separation! Though I tell myself that half my life and half my happiness are wrapped up in you, and that in spite of the distance separating us our hearts are united by indissoluble bonds, my heart rebels against fate and in spite of the pleasures and distractions around me I cannot overcome a certain secret sorrow that has been in my heart ever since we parted. Why are we not together as we were last summer, in your big study, on the blue sofa, the confidential sofa? Why cannot I now, as three months ago, draw fresh moral strength from your look, so gentle, calm, and penetrating, a look I loved so well and seem to see before me as I write?\n\nHaving read thus far, Princess Mary sighed and glanced into the mirror which stood on her right. It reflected a weak, ungraceful figure and thin face. Her eyes, always sad, now looked with particular hopelessness at her reflection in the glass. \u201cShe flatters me,\u201d thought the princess, turning away and continuing to read. But Julie did not flatter her friend, the princess\u2019 eyes\u2014large, deep and luminous (it seemed as if at times there radiated from them shafts of warm light)\u2014were so beautiful that very often in spite of the plainness of her face they gave her an attraction more powerful than that of beauty. But the princess never saw the beautiful expression of her own eyes\u2014the look they had when she was not thinking of herself. As with everyone, her face assumed a forced unnatural expression as soon as she looked in a glass. She went on reading:\n\nAll Moscow talks of nothing but war. One of my two brothers is already abroad, the other is with the Guards, who are starting on their march to the frontier. Our dear Emperor has left Petersburg and it is thought intends to expose his precious person to the chances of war. God grant that the Corsican monster who is destroying the peace of Europe may be overthrown by the angel whom it has pleased the Almighty, in His goodness, to give us as sovereign! To say nothing of my brothers, this war has deprived me of one of the associations nearest my heart. I mean young Nicholas Rost\u00f3v, who with his enthusiasm could not bear to remain inactive and has left the university to join the army. I will confess to you, dear Mary, that in spite of his extreme youth his departure for the army was a great grief to me. This young man, of whom I spoke to you last summer, is so noble-minded and full of that real youthfulness which one seldom finds nowadays among our old men of twenty and, particularly, he is so frank and has so much heart. He is so pure and poetic that my relations with him, transient as they were, have been one of the sweetest comforts to my poor heart, which has already suffered so much. Someday I will tell you about our parting and all that was said then. That is still too fresh. Ah, dear friend, you are happy not to know these poignant joys and sorrows. You are fortunate, for the latter are generally the stronger! I know very well that Count Nicholas is too young ever to be more to me than a friend, but this sweet friendship, this poetic and pure intimacy, were what my heart needed. But enough of this! The chief news, about which all Moscow gossips, is the death of old Count Bez\u00fakhov, and his inheritance. Fancy! The three princesses have received very little, Prince Vas\u00edli nothing, and it is Monsieur Pierre who has inherited all the property and has besides been recognized as legitimate; so that he is now Count Bez\u00fakhov and possessor of the finest fortune in Russia. It is rumored that Prince Vas\u00edli played a very despicable part in this affair and that he returned to Petersburg quite crestfallen.\n\nI confess I understand very little about all these matters of wills and inheritance; but I do know that since this young man, whom we all used to know as plain Monsieur Pierre, has become Count Bez\u00fakhov and the owner of one of the largest fortunes in Russia, I am much amused to watch the change in the tone and manners of the mammas burdened by marriageable daughters, and of the young ladies themselves, toward him, though, between you and me, he always seemed to me a poor sort of fellow. As for the past two years people have amused themselves by finding husbands for me (most of whom I don\u2019t even know), the matchmaking chronicles of Moscow now speak of me as the future Countess Bez\u00fakhova. But you will understand that I have no desire for the post. \u00c0 propos of marriages: do you know that a while ago that universal auntie Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna told me, under the seal of strict secrecy, of a plan of marriage for you. It is neither more nor less than with Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s son Anatole, whom they wish to reform by marrying him to someone rich and distingu\u00e9e, and it is on you that his relations\u2019 choice has fallen. I don\u2019t know what you will think of it, but I consider it my duty to let you know of it. He is said to be very handsome and a terrible scapegrace. That is all I have been able to find out about him.\n\nBut enough of gossip. I am at the end of my second sheet of paper, and Mamma has sent for me to go and dine at the Apr\u00e1ksins\u2019. Read the mystical book I am sending you; it has an enormous success here. Though there are things in it difficult for the feeble human mind to grasp, it is an admirable book which calms and elevates the soul. Adieu! Give my respects to monsieur your father and my compliments to Mademoiselle Bourienne. I embrace you as I love you.\n\nJULIE\n\nP.S. Let me have news of your brother and his charming little wife.\n\nThe princess pondered awhile with a thoughtful smile and her luminous eyes lit up so that her face was entirely transformed. Then she suddenly rose and with her heavy tread went up to the table. She took a sheet of paper and her hand moved rapidly over it. This is the reply she wrote, also in French:\n\nDear and precious Friend, Your letter of the 13th has given me great delight. So you still love me, my romantic Julie? Separation, of which you say so much that is bad, does not seem to have had its usual effect on you. You complain of our separation. What then should I say, if I dared complain, I who am deprived of all who are dear to me? Ah, if we had not religion to console us life would be very sad. Why do you suppose that I should look severely on your affection for that young man? On such matters I am only severe with myself. I understand such feelings in others, and if never having felt them I cannot approve of them, neither do I condemn them. Only it seems to me that Christian love, love of one\u2019s neighbor, love of one\u2019s enemy, is worthier, sweeter, and better than the feelings which the beautiful eyes of a young man can inspire in a romantic and loving young girl like yourself.\n\nThe news of Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s death reached us before your letter and my father was much affected by it. He says the count was the last representative but one of the great century, and that it is his own turn now, but that he will do all he can to let his turn come as late as possible. God preserve us from that terrible misfortune!\n\nI cannot agree with you about Pierre, whom I knew as a child. He always seemed to me to have an excellent heart, and that is the quality I value most in people. As to his inheritance and the part played by Prince Vas\u00edli, it is very sad for both. Ah, my dear friend, our divine Saviour\u2019s words, that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God, are terribly true. I pity Prince Vas\u00edli but am still more sorry for Pierre. So young, and burdened with such riches\u2014to what temptations he will be exposed! If I were asked what I desire most on earth, it would be to be poorer than the poorest beggar. A thousand thanks, dear friend, for the volume you have sent me and which has such success in Moscow. Yet since you tell me that among some good things it contains others which our weak human understanding cannot grasp, it seems to me rather useless to spend time in reading what is unintelligible and can therefore bear no fruit. I never could understand the fondness some people have for confusing their minds by dwelling on mystical books that merely awaken their doubts and excite their imagination, giving them a bent for exaggeration quite contrary to Christian simplicity. Let us rather read the Epistles and Gospels. Let us not seek to penetrate what mysteries they contain; for how can we, miserable sinners that we are, know the terrible and holy secrets of Providence while we remain in this flesh which forms an impenetrable veil between us and the Eternal? Let us rather confine ourselves to studying those sublime rules which our divine Saviour has left for our guidance here below. Let us try to conform to them and follow them, and let us be persuaded that the less we let our feeble human minds roam, the better we shall please God, who rejects all knowledge that does not come from Him; and the less we seek to fathom what He has been pleased to conceal from us, the sooner will He vouchsafe its revelation to us through His divine Spirit.\n\nMy father has not spoken to me of a suitor, but has only told me that he has received a letter and is expecting a visit from Prince Vas\u00edli. In regard to this project of marriage for me, I will tell you, dear sweet friend, that I look on marriage as a divine institution to which we must conform. However painful it may be to me, should the Almighty lay the duties of wife and mother upon me I shall try to perform them as faithfully as I can, without disquieting myself by examining my feelings toward him whom He may give me for husband.\n\nI have had a letter from my brother, who announces his speedy arrival at Bald Hills with his wife. This pleasure will be but a brief one, however, for he will leave us again to take part in this unhappy war into which we have been drawn, God knows how or why. Not only where you are\u2014at the heart of affairs and of the world\u2014is the talk all of war, even here amid fieldwork and the calm of nature\u2014which townsfolk consider characteristic of the country\u2014rumors of war are heard and painfully felt. My father talks of nothing but marches and countermarches, things of which I understand nothing; and the day before yesterday during my daily walk through the village I witnessed a heartrending scene.... It was a convoy of conscripts enrolled from our people and starting to join the army. You should have seen the state of the mothers, wives, and children of the men who were going and should have heard the sobs. It seems as though mankind has forgotten the laws of its divine Saviour, Who preached love and forgiveness of injuries\u2014and that men attribute the greatest merit to skill in killing one another.\n\nAdieu, dear and kind friend; may our divine Saviour and His most Holy Mother keep you in their holy and all-powerful care!\n\nMARY\n\n\u201cAh, you are sending off a letter, Princess? I have already dispatched mine. I have written to my poor mother,\u201d said the smiling Mademoiselle Bourienne rapidly, in her pleasant mellow tones and with guttural r\u2019s. She brought into Princess Mary\u2019s strenuous, mournful, and gloomy world a quite different atmosphere, careless, lighthearted, and self-satisfied.\n\n\u201cPrincess, I must warn you,\u201d she added, lowering her voice and evidently listening to herself with pleasure, and speaking with exaggerated grasseyement, \u201cthe prince has been scolding Michael Iv\u00e1novich. He is in a very bad humor, very morose. Be prepared.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, dear friend,\u201d replied Princess Mary, \u201cI have asked you never to warn me of the humor my father is in. I do not allow myself to judge him and would not have others do so.\u201d\n\nThe princess glanced at her watch and, seeing that she was five minutes late in starting her practice on the clavichord, went into the sitting room with a look of alarm. Between twelve and two o\u2019clock, as the day was mapped out, the prince rested and the princess played the clavichord.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nThe gray-haired valet was sitting drowsily listening to the snoring of the prince, who was in his large study. From the far side of the house through the closed doors came the sound of difficult passages\u2014twenty times repeated\u2014of a sonata by Dussek.\n\nJust then a closed carriage and another with a hood drove up to the porch. Prince Andrew got out of the carriage, helped his little wife to alight, and let her pass into the house before him. Old T\u00edkhon, wearing a wig, put his head out of the door of the antechamber, reported in a whisper that the prince was sleeping, and hastily closed the door. T\u00edkhon knew that neither the son\u2019s arrival nor any other unusual event must be allowed to disturb the appointed order of the day. Prince Andrew apparently knew this as well as T\u00edkhon; he looked at his watch as if to ascertain whether his father\u2019s habits had changed since he was at home last, and, having assured himself that they had not, he turned to his wife.\n\n\u201cHe will get up in twenty minutes. Let us go across to Mary\u2019s room,\u201d he said.\n\nThe little princess had grown stouter during this time, but her eyes and her short, downy, smiling lip lifted when she began to speak just as merrily and prettily as ever.\n\n\u201cWhy, this is a palace!\u201d she said to her husband, looking around with the expression with which people compliment their host at a ball. \u201cLet\u2019s come, quick, quick!\u201d And with a glance round, she smiled at T\u00edkhon, at her husband, and at the footman who accompanied them.\n\n\u201cIs that Mary practicing? Let\u2019s go quietly and take her by surprise.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew followed her with a courteous but sad expression.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve grown older, T\u00edkhon,\u201d he said in passing to the old man, who kissed his hand.\n\nBefore they reached the room from which the sounds of the clavichord came, the pretty, fair-haired Frenchwoman, Mademoiselle Bourienne, rushed out apparently beside herself with delight.\n\n\u201cAh! what joy for the princess!\u201d exclaimed she: \u201cAt last! I must let her know.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no, please not... You are Mademoiselle Bourienne,\u201d said the little princess, kissing her. \u201cI know you already through my sister-in-law\u2019s friendship for you. She was not expecting us?\u201d\n\nThey went up to the door of the sitting room from which came the sound of the oft-repeated passage of the sonata. Prince Andrew stopped and made a grimace, as if expecting something unpleasant.\n\nThe little princess entered the room. The passage broke off in the middle, a cry was heard, then Princess Mary\u2019s heavy tread and the sound of kissing. When Prince Andrew went in the two princesses, who had only met once before for a short time at his wedding, were in each other\u2019s arms warmly pressing their lips to whatever place they happened to touch. Mademoiselle Bourienne stood near them pressing her hand to her heart, with a beatific smile and obviously equally ready to cry or to laugh. Prince Andrew shrugged his shoulders and frowned, as lovers of music do when they hear a false note. The two women let go of one another, and then, as if afraid of being too late, seized each other\u2019s hands, kissing them and pulling them away, and again began kissing each other on the face, and then to Prince Andrew\u2019s surprise both began to cry and kissed again. Mademoiselle Bourienne also began to cry. Prince Andrew evidently felt ill at ease, but to the two women it seemed quite natural that they should cry, and apparently it never entered their heads that it could have been otherwise at this meeting.\n\n\u201cAh! my dear!... Ah! Mary!...\u201d they suddenly exclaimed, and then laughed. \u201cI dreamed last night...\u201d\u2014\u201cYou were not expecting us?...\u201d \u201cAh! Mary, you have got thinner?...\u201d \u201cAnd you have grown stouter!...\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew the princess at once,\u201d put in Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\u201cAnd I had no idea!...\u201d exclaimed Princess Mary. \u201cAh, Andrew, I did not see you.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew and his sister, hand in hand, kissed one another, and he told her she was still the same crybaby as ever. Princess Mary had turned toward her brother, and through her tears the loving, warm, gentle look of her large luminous eyes, very beautiful at that moment, rested on Prince Andrew\u2019s face.\n\nThe little princess talked incessantly, her short, downy upper lip continually and rapidly touching her rosy nether lip when necessary and drawing up again next moment when her face broke into a smile of glittering teeth and sparkling eyes. She told of an accident they had had on the Sp\u00e1sski Hill which might have been serious for her in her condition, and immediately after that informed them that she had left all her clothes in Petersburg and that heaven knew what she would have to dress in here; and that Andrew had quite changed, and that Kitty Od\u00fdntsova had married an old man, and that there was a suitor for Mary, a real one, but that they would talk of that later. Princess Mary was still looking silently at her brother and her beautiful eyes were full of love and sadness. It was plain that she was following a train of thought independent of her sister-in-law\u2019s words. In the midst of a description of the last Petersburg fete she addressed her brother:\n\n\u201cSo you are really going to the war, Andrew?\u201d she said sighing.\n\nLise sighed too.\n\n\u201cYes, and even tomorrow,\u201d replied her brother.\n\n\u201cHe is leaving me here, God knows why, when he might have had promotion...\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary did not listen to the end, but continuing her train of thought turned to her sister-in-law with a tender glance at her figure.\n\n\u201cIs it certain?\u201d she said.\n\nThe face of the little princess changed. She sighed and said: \u201cYes, quite certain. Ah! it is very dreadful...\u201d\n\nHer lip descended. She brought her face close to her sister-in-law\u2019s and unexpectedly again began to cry.\n\n\u201cShe needs rest,\u201d said Prince Andrew with a frown. \u201cDon\u2019t you, Lise? Take her to your room and I\u2019ll go to Father. How is he? Just the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, just the same. Though I don\u2019t know what your opinion will be,\u201d answered the princess joyfully.\n\n\u201cAnd are the hours the same? And the walks in the avenues? And the lathe?\u201d asked Prince Andrew with a scarcely perceptible smile which showed that, in spite of all his love and respect for his father, he was aware of his weaknesses.\n\n\u201cThe hours are the same, and the lathe, and also the mathematics and my geometry lessons,\u201d said Princess Mary gleefully, as if her lessons in geometry were among the greatest delights of her life.\n\nWhen the twenty minutes had elapsed and the time had come for the old prince to get up, T\u00edkhon came to call the young prince to his father. The old man made a departure from his usual routine in honor of his son\u2019s arrival: he gave orders to admit him to his apartments while he dressed for dinner. The old prince always dressed in old-fashioned style, wearing an antique coat and powdered hair; and when Prince Andrew entered his father\u2019s dressing room (not with the contemptuous look and manner he wore in drawing rooms, but with the animated face with which he talked to Pierre), the old man was sitting on a large leather-covered chair, wrapped in a powdering mantle, entrusting his head to T\u00edkhon.\n\n\u201cAh! here\u2019s the warrior! Wants to vanquish Buonaparte?\u201d said the old man, shaking his powdered head as much as the tail, which T\u00edkhon was holding fast to plait, would allow.\n\n\u201cYou at least must tackle him properly, or else if he goes on like this he\u2019ll soon have us, too, for his subjects! How are you?\u201d And he held out his cheek.\n\nThe old man was in a good temper after his nap before dinner. (He used to say that a nap \u201cafter dinner was silver\u2014before dinner, golden.\u201d) He cast happy, sidelong glances at his son from under his thick, bushy eyebrows. Prince Andrew went up and kissed his father on the spot indicated to him. He made no reply on his father\u2019s favorite topic\u2014making fun of the military men of the day, and more particularly of Bonaparte.\n\n\u201cYes, Father, I have come to you and brought my wife who is pregnant,\u201d said Prince Andrew, following every movement of his father\u2019s face with an eager and respectful look. \u201cHow is your health?\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly fools and rakes fall ill, my boy. You know me: I am busy from morning till night and abstemious, so of course I am well.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God,\u201d said his son smiling.\n\n\u201cGod has nothing to do with it! Well, go on,\u201d he continued, returning to his hobby; \u201ctell me how the Germans have taught you to fight Bonaparte by this new science you call \u2018strategy.\u2019\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\u201cGive me time to collect my wits, Father,\u201d said he, with a smile that showed that his father\u2019s foibles did not prevent his son from loving and honoring him. \u201cWhy, I have not yet had time to settle down!\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, nonsense!\u201d cried the old man, shaking his pigtail to see whether it was firmly plaited, and grasping his by the hand. \u201cThe house for your wife is ready. Princess Mary will take her there and show her over, and they\u2019ll talk nineteen to the dozen. That\u2019s their woman\u2019s way! I am glad to have her. Sit down and talk. About Mikhelson\u2019s army I understand\u2014Tolst\u00f3y\u2018s too... a simultaneous expedition.... But what\u2019s the southern army to do? Prussia is neutral... I know that. What about Austria?\u201d said he, rising from his chair and pacing up and down the room followed by T\u00edkhon, who ran after him, handing him different articles of clothing. \u201cWhat of Sweden? How will they cross Pomerania?\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, seeing that his father insisted, began\u2014at first reluctantly, but gradually with more and more animation, and from habit changing unconsciously from Russian to French as he went on\u2014to explain the plan of operation for the coming campaign. He explained how an army, ninety thousand strong, was to threaten Prussia so as to bring her out of her neutrality and draw her into the war; how part of that army was to join some Swedish forces at Stralsund; how two hundred and twenty thousand Austrians, with a hundred thousand Russians, were to operate in Italy and on the Rhine; how fifty thousand Russians and as many English were to land at Naples, and how a total force of five hundred thousand men was to attack the French from different sides. The old prince did not evince the least interest during this explanation, but as if he were not listening to it continued to dress while walking about, and three times unexpectedly interrupted. Once he stopped it by shouting: \u201cThe white one, the white one!\u201d\n\nThis meant that T\u00edkhon was not handing him the waistcoat he wanted. Another time he interrupted, saying:\n\n\u201cAnd will she soon be confined?\u201d and shaking his head reproachfully said: \u201cThat\u2019s bad! Go on, go on.\u201d\n\nThe third interruption came when Prince Andrew was finishing his description. The old man began to sing, in the cracked voice of old age: \u201cMalbrook s\u2019en va-t-en guerre. Dieu sait quand reviendra.\u201d\n\nHis son only smiled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t say it\u2019s a plan I approve of,\u201d said the son; \u201cI am only telling you what it is. Napoleon has also formed his plan by now, not worse than this one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019ve told me nothing new,\u201d and the old man repeated, meditatively and rapidly:\n\n\u201cDieu sait quand reviendra. Go to the dining room.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nAt the appointed hour the prince, powdered and shaven, entered the dining room where his daughter-in-law, Princess Mary, and Mademoiselle Bourienne were already awaiting him together with his architect, who by a strange caprice of his employer\u2019s was admitted to table though the position of that insignificant individual was such as could certainly not have caused him to expect that honor. The prince, who generally kept very strictly to social distinctions and rarely admitted even important government officials to his table, had unexpectedly selected Michael Iv\u00e1novich (who always went into a corner to blow his nose on his checked handkerchief) to illustrate the theory that all men are equals, and had more than once impressed on his daughter that Michael Iv\u00e1novich was \u201cnot a whit worse than you or I.\u201d At dinner the prince usually spoke to the taciturn Michael Iv\u00e1novich more often than to anyone else.\n\nIn the dining room, which like all the rooms in the house was exceedingly lofty, the members of the household and the footmen\u2014one behind each chair\u2014stood waiting for the prince to enter. The head butler, napkin on arm, was scanning the setting of the table, making signs to the footmen, and anxiously glancing from the clock to the door by which the prince was to enter. Prince Andrew was looking at a large gilt frame, new to him, containing the genealogical tree of the Princes Bolk\u00f3nski, opposite which hung another such frame with a badly painted portrait (evidently by the hand of the artist belonging to the estate) of a ruling prince, in a crown\u2014an alleged descendant of R\u00farik and ancestor of the Bolk\u00f3nskis. Prince Andrew, looking again at that genealogical tree, shook his head, laughing as a man laughs who looks at a portrait so characteristic of the original as to be amusing.\n\n\u201cHow thoroughly like him that is!\u201d he said to Princess Mary, who had come up to him.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her brother in surprise. She did not understand what he was laughing at. Everything her father did inspired her with reverence and was beyond question.\n\n\u201cEveryone has his Achilles\u2019 heel,\u201d continued Prince Andrew. \u201cFancy, with his powerful mind, indulging in such nonsense!\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary could not understand the boldness of her brother\u2019s criticism and was about to reply, when the expected footsteps were heard coming from the study. The prince walked in quickly and jauntily as was his wont, as if intentionally contrasting the briskness of his manners with the strict formality of his house. At that moment the great clock struck two and another with a shrill tone joined in from the drawing room. The prince stood still; his lively glittering eyes from under their thick, bushy eyebrows sternly scanned all present and rested on the little princess. She felt, as courtiers do when the Tsar enters, the sensation of fear and respect which the old man inspired in all around him. He stroked her hair and then patted her awkwardly on the back of her neck.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad, glad, to see you,\u201d he said, looking attentively into her eyes, and then quickly went to his place and sat down. \u201cSit down, sit down! Sit down, Michael Iv\u00e1novich!\u201d\n\nHe indicated a place beside him to his daughter-in-law. A footman moved the chair for her.\n\n\u201cHo, ho!\u201d said the old man, casting his eyes on her rounded figure. \u201cYou\u2019ve been in a hurry. That\u2019s bad!\u201d\n\nHe laughed in his usual dry, cold, unpleasant way, with his lips only and not with his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou must walk, walk as much as possible, as much as possible,\u201d he said.\n\nThe little princess did not, or did not wish to, hear his words. She was silent and seemed confused. The prince asked her about her father, and she began to smile and talk. He asked about mutual acquaintances, and she became still more animated and chattered away giving him greetings from various people and retelling the town gossip.\n\n\u201cCountess Apr\u00e1ksina, poor thing, has lost her husband and she has cried her eyes out,\u201d she said, growing more and more lively.\n\nAs she became animated the prince looked at her more and more sternly, and suddenly, as if he had studied her sufficiently and had formed a definite idea of her, he turned away and addressed Michael Iv\u00e1novich.\n\n\u201cWell, Michael Iv\u00e1novich, our Bonaparte will be having a bad time of it. Prince Andrew\u201d (he always spoke thus of his son) \u201chas been telling me what forces are being collected against him! While you and I never thought much of him.\u201d\n\nMichael Iv\u00e1novich did not at all know when \u201cyou and I\u201d had said such things about Bonaparte, but understanding that he was wanted as a peg on which to hang the prince\u2019s favorite topic, he looked inquiringly at the young prince, wondering what would follow.\n\n\u201cHe is a great tactician!\u201d said the prince to his son, pointing to the architect.\n\nAnd the conversation again turned on the war, on Bonaparte, and the generals and statesmen of the day. The old prince seemed convinced not only that all the men of the day were mere babies who did not know the A B C of war or of politics, and that Bonaparte was an insignificant little Frenchy, successful only because there were no longer any Pot\u00ebmkins or Suv\u00f3rovs left to oppose him; but he was also convinced that there were no political difficulties in Europe and no real war, but only a sort of puppet show at which the men of the day were playing, pretending to do something real. Prince Andrew gaily bore with his father\u2019s ridicule of the new men, and drew him on and listened to him with evident pleasure.\n\n\u201cThe past always seems good,\u201d said he, \u201cbut did not Suv\u00f3rov himself fall into a trap Moreau set him, and from which he did not know how to escape?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho told you that? Who?\u201d cried the prince. \u201cSuv\u00f3rov!\u201d And he jerked away his plate, which T\u00edkhon briskly caught. \u201cSuv\u00f3rov!... Consider, Prince Andrew. Two... Frederick and Suv\u00f3rov; Moreau!... Moreau would have been a prisoner if Suv\u00f3rov had had a free hand; but he had the Hofs-kriegs-wurst-schnapps-Rath on his hands. It would have puzzled the devil himself! When you get there you\u2019ll find out what those Hofs-kriegs-wurst-Raths are! Suv\u00f3rov couldn\u2019t manage them so what chance has Michael Kut\u00fazov? No, my dear boy,\u201d he continued, \u201cyou and your generals won\u2019t get on against Buonaparte; you\u2019ll have to call in the French, so that birds of a feather may fight together. The German, Pahlen, has been sent to New York in America, to fetch the Frenchman, Moreau,\u201d he said, alluding to the invitation made that year to Moreau to enter the Russian service.... \u201cWonderful!... Were the Pot\u00ebmkins, Suv\u00f3rovs, and Orl\u00f3vs Germans? No, lad, either you fellows have all lost your wits, or I have outlived mine. May God help you, but we\u2019ll see what will happen. Buonaparte has become a great commander among them! Hm!...\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t at all say that all the plans are good,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cI am only surprised at your opinion of Bonaparte. You may laugh as much as you like, but all the same Bonaparte is a great general!\u201d\n\n\u201cMichael Iv\u00e1novich!\u201d cried the old prince to the architect who, busy with his roast meat, hoped he had been forgotten: \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you Buonaparte was a great tactician? Here, he says the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure, your excellency,\u201d replied the architect.\n\nThe prince again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\n\u201cBuonaparte was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He has got splendid soldiers. Besides he began by attacking Germans. And only idlers have failed to beat the Germans. Since the world began everybody has beaten the Germans. They beat no one\u2014except one another. He made his reputation fighting them.\u201d\n\nAnd the prince began explaining all the blunders which, according to him, Bonaparte had made in his campaigns and even in politics. His son made no rejoinder, but it was evident that whatever arguments were presented he was as little able as his father to change his opinion. He listened, refraining from a reply, and involuntarily wondered how this old man, living alone in the country for so many years, could know and discuss so minutely and acutely all the recent European military and political events.\n\n\u201cYou think I\u2019m an old man and don\u2019t understand the present state of affairs?\u201d concluded his father. \u201cBut it troubles me. I don\u2019t sleep at night. Come now, where has this great commander of yours shown his skill?\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cThat would take too long to tell,\u201d answered the son.\n\n\u201cWell, then go off to your Buonaparte! Mademoiselle Bourienne, here\u2019s another admirer of that powder-monkey emperor of yours,\u201d he exclaimed in excellent French.\n\n\u201cYou know, Prince, I am not a Bonapartist!\u201d\n\n\u201cDieu sait quand reviendra.\u201d hummed the prince out of tune and, with a laugh still more so, he quitted the table.\n\nThe little princess during the whole discussion and the rest of the dinner sat silent, glancing with a frightened look now at her father-in-law and now at Princess Mary. When they left the table she took her sister-in-law\u2019s arm and drew her into another room.\n\n\u201cWhat a clever man your father is,\u201d said she; \u201cperhaps that is why I am afraid of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he is so kind!\u201d answered Princess Mary.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nPrince Andrew was to leave next evening. The old prince, not altering his routine, retired as usual after dinner. The little princess was in her sister-in-law\u2019s room. Prince Andrew in a traveling coat without epaulettes had been packing with his valet in the rooms assigned to him. After inspecting the carriage himself and seeing the trunks put in, he ordered the horses to be harnessed. Only those things he always kept with him remained in his room; a small box, a large canteen fitted with silver plate, two Turkish pistols and a saber\u2014a present from his father who had brought it from the siege of Och\u00e1kov. All these traveling effects of Prince Andrew\u2019s were in very good order: new, clean, and in cloth covers carefully tied with tapes.\n\nWhen starting on a journey or changing their mode of life, men capable of reflection are generally in a serious frame of mind. At such moments one reviews the past and plans for the future. Prince Andrew\u2019s face looked very thoughtful and tender. With his hands behind him he paced briskly from corner to corner of the room, looking straight before him and thoughtfully shaking his head. Did he fear going to the war, or was he sad at leaving his wife?\u2014perhaps both, but evidently he did not wish to be seen in that mood, for hearing footsteps in the passage he hurriedly unclasped his hands, stopped at a table as if tying the cover of the small box, and assumed his usual tranquil and impenetrable expression. It was the heavy tread of Princess Mary that he heard.\n\n\u201cI hear you have given orders to harness,\u201d she cried, panting (she had apparently been running), \u201cand I did so wish to have another talk with you alone! God knows how long we may again be parted. You are not angry with me for coming? You have changed so, Andr\u00fasha,\u201d she added, as if to explain such a question.\n\nShe smiled as she uttered his pet name, \u201cAndr\u00fasha.\u201d It was obviously strange to her to think that this stern handsome man should be Andr\u00fasha\u2014the slender mischievous boy who had been her playfellow in childhood.\n\n\u201cAnd where is Lise?\u201d he asked, answering her question only by a smile.\n\n\u201cShe was so tired that she has fallen asleep on the sofa in my room. Oh, Andrew! What a treasure of a wife you have,\u201d said she, sitting down on the sofa, facing her brother. \u201cShe is quite a child: such a dear, merry child. I have grown so fond of her.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew was silent, but the princess noticed the ironical and contemptuous look that showed itself on his face.\n\n\u201cOne must be indulgent to little weaknesses; who is free from them, Andrew? Don\u2019t forget that she has grown up and been educated in society, and so her position now is not a rosy one. We should enter into everyone\u2019s situation. Tout comprendre, c\u2019est tout pardonner. Think what it must be for her, poor thing, after what she has been used to, to be parted from her husband and be left alone in the country, in her condition! It\u2019s very hard.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled as he looked at his sister, as we smile at those we think we thoroughly understand.\n\n\u201cYou live in the country and don\u2019t think the life terrible,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cI... that\u2019s different. Why speak of me? I don\u2019t want any other life, and can\u2019t, for I know no other. But think, Andrew: for a young society woman to be buried in the country during the best years of her life, all alone\u2014for Papa is always busy, and I... well, you know what poor resources I have for entertaining a woman used to the best society. There is only Mademoiselle Bourienne....\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like your Mademoiselle Bourienne at all,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cNo? She is very nice and kind and, above all, she\u2019s much to be pitied. She has no one, no one. To tell the truth, I don\u2019t need her, and she\u2019s even in my way. You know I always was a savage, and now am even more so. I like being alone.... Father likes her very much. She and Michael Iv\u00e1novich are the two people to whom he is always gentle and kind, because he has been a benefactor to them both. As Sterne says: \u2018We don\u2019t love people so much for the good they have done us, as for the good we have done them.\u2019 Father took her when she was homeless after losing her own father. She is very good-natured, and my father likes her way of reading. She reads to him in the evenings and reads splendidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be quite frank, Mary, I expect Father\u2019s character sometimes makes things trying for you, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Prince Andrew asked suddenly.\n\nPrincess Mary was first surprised and then aghast at this question.\n\n\u201cFor me? For me?... Trying for me!...\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cHe always was rather harsh; and now I should think he\u2019s getting very trying,\u201d said Prince Andrew, apparently speaking lightly of their father in order to puzzle or test his sister.\n\n\u201cYou are good in every way, Andrew, but you have a kind of intellectual pride,\u201d said the princess, following the train of her own thoughts rather than the trend of the conversation\u2014\u201cand that\u2019s a great sin. How can one judge Father? But even if one might, what feeling except veneration could such a man as my father evoke? And I am so contented and happy with him. I only wish you were all as happy as I am.\u201d\n\nHer brother shook his head incredulously.\n\n\u201cThe only thing that is hard for me... I will tell you the truth, Andrew... is Father\u2019s way of treating religious subjects. I don\u2019t understand how a man of his immense intellect can fail to see what is as clear as day, and can go so far astray. That is the only thing that makes me unhappy. But even in this I can see lately a shade of improvement. His satire has been less bitter of late, and there was a monk he received and had a long talk with.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! my dear, I am afraid you and your monk are wasting your powder,\u201d said Prince Andrew banteringly yet tenderly.\n\n\u201cAh! mon ami, I only pray, and hope that God will hear me. Andrew...\u201d she said timidly after a moment\u2019s silence, \u201cI have a great favor to ask of you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, dear?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo\u2014promise that you will not refuse! It will give you no trouble and is nothing unworthy of you, but it will comfort me. Promise, Andr\u00fasha!...\u201d said she, putting her hand in her reticule but not yet taking out what she was holding inside it, as if what she held were the subject of her request and must not be shown before the request was granted.\n\nShe looked timidly at her brother.\n\n\u201cEven if it were a great deal of trouble...\u201d answered Prince Andrew, as if guessing what it was about.\n\n\u201cThink what you please! I know you are just like Father. Think as you please, but do this for my sake! Please do! Father\u2019s father, our grandfather, wore it in all his wars.\u201d (She still did not take out what she was holding in her reticule.) \u201cSo you promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course. What is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cAndrew, I bless you with this icon and you must promise me you will never take it off. Do you promise?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it does not weigh a hundredweight and won\u2019t break my neck... To please you...\u201d said Prince Andrew. But immediately, noticing the pained expression his joke had brought to his sister\u2019s face, he repented and added: \u201cI am glad; really, dear, I am very glad.\u201d\n\n\u201cAgainst your will He will save and have mercy on you and bring you to Himself, for in Him alone is truth and peace,\u201d said she in a voice trembling with emotion, solemnly holding up in both hands before her brother a small, oval, antique, dark-faced icon of the Saviour in a gold setting, on a finely wrought silver chain.\n\nShe crossed herself, kissed the icon, and handed it to Andrew.\n\n\u201cPlease, Andrew, for my sake!...\u201d\n\nRays of gentle light shone from her large, timid eyes. Those eyes lit up the whole of her thin, sickly face and made it beautiful. Her brother would have taken the icon, but she stopped him. Andrew understood, crossed himself and kissed the icon. There was a look of tenderness, for he was touched, but also a gleam of irony on his face.\n\n\u201cThank you, my dear.\u201d She kissed him on the forehead and sat down again on the sofa. They were silent for a while.\n\n\u201cAs I was saying to you, Andrew, be kind and generous as you always used to be. Don\u2019t judge Lise harshly,\u201d she began. \u201cShe is so sweet, so good-natured, and her position now is a very hard one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not think I have complained of my wife to you, M\u00e1sha, or blamed her. Why do you say all this to me?\u201d\n\nRed patches appeared on Princess Mary\u2019s face and she was silent as if she felt guilty.\n\n\u201cI have said nothing to you, but you have already been talked to. And I am sorry for that,\u201d he went on.\n\nThe patches grew deeper on her forehead, neck, and cheeks. She tried to say something but could not. Her brother had guessed right: the little princess had been crying after dinner and had spoken of her forebodings about her confinement, and how she dreaded it, and had complained of her fate, her father-in-law, and her husband. After crying she had fallen asleep. Prince Andrew felt sorry for his sister.\n\n\u201cKnow this, M\u00e1sha: I can\u2019t reproach, have not reproached, and never shall reproach my wife with anything, and I cannot reproach myself with anything in regard to her; and that always will be so in whatever circumstances I may be placed. But if you want to know the truth... if you want to know whether I am happy? No! Is she happy? No! But why this is so I don\u2019t know...\u201d\n\nAs he said this he rose, went to his sister, and, stooping, kissed her forehead. His fine eyes lit up with a thoughtful, kindly, and unaccustomed brightness, but he was looking not at his sister but over her head toward the darkness of the open doorway.\n\n\u201cLet us go to her, I must say good-by. Or\u2014go and wake and I\u2019ll come in a moment. Petr\u00fashka!\u201d he called to his valet: \u201cCome here, take these away. Put this on the seat and this to the right.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary rose and moved to the door, then stopped and said: \u201cAndrew, if you had faith you would have turned to God and asked Him to give you the love you do not feel, and your prayer would have been answered.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, maybe!\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cGo, M\u00e1sha; I\u2019ll come immediately.\u201d\n\nOn the way to his sister\u2019s room, in the passage which connected one wing with the other, Prince Andrew met Mademoiselle Bourienne smiling sweetly. It was the third time that day that, with an ecstatic and artless smile, she had met him in secluded passages.\n\n\u201cOh! I thought you were in your room,\u201d she said, for some reason blushing and dropping her eyes.\n\nPrince Andrew looked sternly at her and an expression of anger suddenly came over his face. He said nothing to her but looked at her forehead and hair, without looking at her eyes, with such contempt that the Frenchwoman blushed and went away without a word. When he reached his sister\u2019s room his wife was already awake and her merry voice, hurrying one word after another, came through the open door. She was speaking as usual in French, and as if after long self-restraint she wished to make up for lost time.\n\n\u201cNo, but imagine the old Countess Z\u00fabova, with false curls and her mouth full of false teeth, as if she were trying to cheat old age.... Ha, ha, ha! Mary!\u201d\n\nThis very sentence about Countess Z\u00fabova and this same laugh Prince Andrew had already heard from his wife in the presence of others some five times. He entered the room softly. The little princess, plump and rosy, was sitting in an easy chair with her work in her hands, talking incessantly, repeating Petersburg reminiscences and even phrases. Prince Andrew came up, stroked her hair, and asked if she felt rested after their journey. She answered him and continued her chatter.\n\nThe coach with six horses was waiting at the porch. It was an autumn night, so dark that the coachman could not see the carriage pole. Servants with lanterns were bustling about in the porch. The immense house was brilliant with lights shining through its lofty windows. The domestic serfs were crowding in the hall, waiting to bid good-by to the young prince. The members of the household were all gathered in the reception hall: Michael Iv\u00e1novich, Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary, and the little princess. Prince Andrew had been called to his father\u2019s study as the latter wished to say good-by to him alone. All were waiting for them to come out.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew entered the study the old man in his old-age spectacles and white dressing gown, in which he received no one but his son, sat at the table writing. He glanced round.\n\n\u201cGoing?\u201d And he went on writing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to say good-by.\u201d\n\n\u201cKiss me here,\u201d and he touched his cheek: \u201cThanks, thanks!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you thank me for?\u201d\n\n\u201cFor not dilly-dallying and not hanging to a woman\u2019s apron strings. The Service before everything. Thanks, thanks!\u201d And he went on writing, so that his quill spluttered and squeaked. \u201cIf you have anything to say, say it. These two things can be done together,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cAbout my wife... I am ashamed as it is to leave her on your hands....\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy talk nonsense? Say what you want.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen her confinement is due, send to Moscow for an accoucheur.... Let him be here....\u201d\n\nThe old prince stopped writing and, as if not understanding, fixed his stern eyes on his son.\n\n\u201cI know that no one can help if nature does not do her work,\u201d said Prince Andrew, evidently confused. \u201cI know that out of a million cases only one goes wrong, but it is her fancy and mine. They have been telling her things. She has had a dream and is frightened.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm... Hm...\u201d muttered the old prince to himself, finishing what he was writing. \u201cI\u2019ll do it.\u201d\n\nHe signed with a flourish and suddenly turning to his son began to laugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad business, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is bad, Father?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wife!\u201d said the old prince, briefly and significantly.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand!\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cNo, it can\u2019t be helped, lad,\u201d said the prince. \u201cThey\u2019re all like that; one can\u2019t unmarry. Don\u2019t be afraid; I won\u2019t tell anyone, but you know it yourself.\u201d\n\nHe seized his son by the hand with small bony fingers, shook it, looked straight into his son\u2019s face with keen eyes which seemed to see through him, and again laughed his frigid laugh.\n\nThe son sighed, thus admitting that his father had understood him. The old man continued to fold and seal his letter, snatching up and throwing down the wax, the seal, and the paper, with his accustomed rapidity.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s to be done? She\u2019s pretty! I will do everything. Make your mind easy,\u201d said he in abrupt sentences while sealing his letter.\n\nAndrew did not speak; he was both pleased and displeased that his father understood him. The old man got up and gave the letter to his son.\n\n\u201cListen!\u201d said he; \u201cdon\u2019t worry about your wife: what can be done shall be. Now listen! Give this letter to Michael Ilari\u00f3novich. I have written that he should make use of you in proper places and not keep you long as an adjutant: a bad position! Tell him I remember and like him. Write and tell me how he receives you. If he is all right\u2014serve him. Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s son need not serve under anyone if he is in disfavor. Now come here.\u201d\n\nHe spoke so rapidly that he did not finish half his words, but his son was accustomed to understand him. He led him to the desk, raised the lid, drew out a drawer, and took out an exercise book filled with his bold, tall, close handwriting.\n\n\u201cI shall probably die before you. So remember, these are my memoirs; hand them to the Emperor after my death. Now here is a Lombard bond and a letter; it is a premium for the man who writes a history of Suv\u00f3rov\u2019s wars. Send it to the Academy. Here are some jottings for you to read when I am gone. You will find them useful.\u201d\n\nAndrew did not tell his father that he would no doubt live a long time yet. He felt that he must not say it.\n\n\u201cI will do it all, Father,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWell, now, good-by!\u201d He gave his son his hand to kiss, and embraced him. \u201cRemember this, Prince Andrew, if they kill you it will hurt me, your old father...\u201d he paused unexpectedly, and then in a querulous voice suddenly shrieked: \u201cbut if I hear that you have not behaved like a son of Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski, I shall be ashamed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou need not have said that to me, Father,\u201d said the son with a smile.\n\nThe old man was silent.\n\n\u201cI also wanted to ask you,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cif I\u2019m killed and if I have a son, do not let him be taken away from you\u2014as I said yesterday... let him grow up with you.... Please.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot let the wife have him?\u201d said the old man, and laughed.\n\nThey stood silent, facing one another. The old man\u2019s sharp eyes were fixed straight on his son\u2019s. Something twitched in the lower part of the old prince\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve said good-by. Go!\u201d he suddenly shouted in a loud, angry voice, opening his door.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? What?\u201d asked both princesses when they saw for a moment at the door Prince Andrew and the figure of the old man in a white dressing gown, spectacled and wigless, shouting in an angry voice.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and made no reply.\n\n\u201cWell!\u201d he said, turning to his wife.\n\nAnd this \u201cWell!\u201d sounded coldly ironic, as if he were saying: \u201cNow go through your performance.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndrew, already!\u201d said the little princess, turning pale and looking with dismay at her husband.\n\nHe embraced her. She screamed and fell unconscious on his shoulder.\n\nHe cautiously released the shoulder she leaned on, looked into her face, and carefully placed her in an easy chair.\n\n\u201cAdieu, Mary,\u201d said he gently to his sister, taking her by the hand and kissing her, and then he left the room with rapid steps.\n\nThe little princess lay in the armchair, Mademoiselle Bourienne chafing her temples. Princess Mary, supporting her sister-in-law, still looked with her beautiful eyes full of tears at the door through which Prince Andrew had gone and made the sign of the cross in his direction. From the study, like pistol shots, came the frequent sound of the old man angrily blowing his nose. Hardly had Prince Andrew gone when the study door opened quickly and the stern figure of the old man in the white dressing gown looked out.\n\n\u201cGone? That\u2019s all right!\u201d said he; and looking angrily at the unconscious little princess, he shook his head reprovingly and slammed the door.\n\n\n\nBOOK TWO: 1805\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn October, 1805, a Russian army was occupying the villages and towns of the Archduchy of Austria, and yet other regiments freshly arriving from Russia were settling near the fortress of Braunau and burdening the inhabitants on whom they were quartered. Braunau was the headquarters of the commander in chief, Kut\u00fazov.\n\nOn October 11, 1805, one of the infantry regiments that had just reached Braunau had halted half a mile from the town, waiting to be inspected by the commander in chief. Despite the un-Russian appearance of the locality and surroundings\u2014fruit gardens, stone fences, tiled roofs, and hills in the distance\u2014and despite the fact that the inhabitants (who gazed with curiosity at the soldiers) were not Russians, the regiment had just the appearance of any Russian regiment preparing for an inspection anywhere in the heart of Russia.\n\nOn the evening of the last day\u2019s march an order had been received that the commander in chief would inspect the regiment on the march. Though the words of the order were not clear to the regimental commander, and the question arose whether the troops were to be in marching order or not, it was decided at a consultation between the battalion commanders to present the regiment in parade order, on the principle that it is always better to \u201cbow too low than not bow low enough.\u201d So the soldiers, after a twenty-mile march, were kept mending and cleaning all night long without closing their eyes, while the adjutants and company commanders calculated and reckoned, and by morning the regiment\u2014instead of the straggling, disorderly crowd it had been on its last march the day before\u2014presented a well-ordered array of two thousand men each of whom knew his place and his duty, had every button and every strap in place, and shone with cleanliness. And not only externally was all in order, but had it pleased the commander in chief to look under the uniforms he would have found on every man a clean shirt, and in every knapsack the appointed number of articles, \u201cawl, soap, and all,\u201d as the soldiers say. There was only one circumstance concerning which no one could be at ease. It was the state of the soldiers\u2019 boots. More than half the men\u2019s boots were in holes. But this defect was not due to any fault of the regimental commander, for in spite of repeated demands boots had not been issued by the Austrian commissariat, and the regiment had marched some seven hundred miles.\n\nThe commander of the regiment was an elderly, choleric, stout, and thick-set general with grizzled eyebrows and whiskers, and wider from chest to back than across the shoulders. He had on a brand-new uniform showing the creases where it had been folded and thick gold epaulettes which seemed to stand rather than lie down on his massive shoulders. He had the air of a man happily performing one of the most solemn duties of his life. He walked about in front of the line and at every step pulled himself up, slightly arching his back. It was plain that the commander admired his regiment, rejoiced in it, and that his whole mind was engrossed by it, yet his strut seemed to indicate that, besides military matters, social interests and the fair sex occupied no small part of his thoughts.\n\n\u201cWell, Michael M\u00edtrich, sir?\u201d he said, addressing one of the battalion commanders who smilingly pressed forward (it was plain that they both felt happy). \u201cWe had our hands full last night. However, I think the regiment is not a bad one, eh?\u201d\n\nThe battalion commander perceived the jovial irony and laughed.\n\n\u201cIt would not be turned off the field even on the Tsar\u00edtsin Meadow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked the commander.\n\nAt that moment, on the road from the town on which signalers had been posted, two men appeared on horse back. They were an aide-de-camp followed by a Cossack.\n\nThe aide-de-camp was sent to confirm the order which had not been clearly worded the day before, namely, that the commander in chief wished to see the regiment just in the state in which it had been on the march: in their greatcoats, and packs, and without any preparation whatever.\n\nA member of the Hofkriegsrath from Vienna had come to Kut\u00fazov the day before with proposals and demands for him to join up with the army of the Archduke Ferdinand and Mack, and Kut\u00fazov, not considering this junction advisable, meant, among other arguments in support of his view, to show the Austrian general the wretched state in which the troops arrived from Russia. With this object he intended to meet the regiment; so the worse the condition it was in, the better pleased the commander in chief would be. Though the aide-de-camp did not know these circumstances, he nevertheless delivered the definite order that the men should be in their greatcoats and in marching order, and that the commander in chief would otherwise be dissatisfied. On hearing this the regimental commander hung his head, silently shrugged his shoulders, and spread out his arms with a choleric gesture.\n\n\u201cA fine mess we\u2019ve made of it!\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cThere now! Didn\u2019t I tell you, Michael M\u00edtrich, that if it was said \u2018on the march\u2019 it meant in greatcoats?\u201d said he reproachfully to the battalion commander. \u201cOh, my God!\u201d he added, stepping resolutely forward. \u201cCompany commanders!\u201d he shouted in a voice accustomed to command. \u201cSergeants major!... How soon will he be here?\u201d he asked the aide-de-camp with a respectful politeness evidently relating to the personage he was referring to.\n\n\u201cIn an hour\u2019s time, I should say.\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we have time to change clothes?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, General....\u201d\n\nThe regimental commander, going up to the line himself, ordered the soldiers to change into their greatcoats. The company commanders ran off to their companies, the sergeants major began bustling (the greatcoats were not in very good condition), and instantly the squares that had up to then been in regular order and silent began to sway and stretch and hum with voices. On all sides soldiers were running to and fro, throwing up their knapsacks with a jerk of their shoulders and pulling the straps over their heads, unstrapping their overcoats and drawing the sleeves on with upraised arms.\n\nIn half an hour all was again in order, only the squares had become gray instead of black. The regimental commander walked with his jerky steps to the front of the regiment and examined it from a distance.\n\n\u201cWhatever is this? This!\u201d he shouted and stood still. \u201cCommander of the third company!\u201d\n\n\u201cCommander of the third company wanted by the general!... commander to the general... third company to the commander.\u201d The words passed along the lines and an adjutant ran to look for the missing officer.\n\nWhen the eager but misrepeated words had reached their destination in a cry of: \u201cThe general to the third company,\u201d the missing officer appeared from behind his company and, though he was a middle-aged man and not in the habit of running, trotted awkwardly stumbling on his toes toward the general. The captain\u2019s face showed the uneasiness of a schoolboy who is told to repeat a lesson he has not learned. Spots appeared on his nose, the redness of which was evidently due to intemperance, and his mouth twitched nervously. The general looked the captain up and down as he came up panting, slackening his pace as he approached.\n\n\u201cYou will soon be dressing your men in petticoats! What is this?\u201d shouted the regimental commander, thrusting forward his jaw and pointing at a soldier in the ranks of the third company in a greatcoat of bluish cloth, which contrasted with the others. \u201cWhat have you been after? The commander in chief is expected and you leave your place? Eh? I\u2019ll teach you to dress the men in fancy coats for a parade.... Eh...?\u201d\n\nThe commander of the company, with his eyes fixed on his superior, pressed two fingers more and more rigidly to his cap, as if in this pressure lay his only hope of salvation.\n\n\u201cWell, why don\u2019t you speak? Whom have you got there dressed up as a Hungarian?\u201d said the commander with an austere gibe.\n\n\u201cYour excellency...\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, your excellency, what? Your excellency! But what about your excellency?... nobody knows.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour excellency, it\u2019s the officer D\u00f3lokhov, who has been reduced to the ranks,\u201d said the captain softly.\n\n\u201cWell? Has he been degraded into a field marshal, or into a soldier? If a soldier, he should be dressed in regulation uniform like the others.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour excellency, you gave him leave yourself, on the march.\u201d\n\n\u201cGave him leave? Leave? That\u2019s just like you young men,\u201d said the regimental commander cooling down a little. \u201cLeave indeed.... One says a word to you and you... What?\u201d he added with renewed irritation, \u201cI beg you to dress your men decently.\u201d\n\nAnd the commander, turning to look at the adjutant, directed his jerky steps down the line. He was evidently pleased at his own display of anger and walking up to the regiment wished to find a further excuse for wrath. Having snapped at an officer for an unpolished badge, at another because his line was not straight, he reached the third company.\n\n\u201cH-o-o-w are you standing? Where\u2019s your leg? Your leg?\u201d shouted the commander with a tone of suffering in his voice, while there were still five men between him and D\u00f3lokhov with his bluish-gray uniform.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov slowly straightened his bent knee, looking straight with his clear, insolent eyes in the general\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhy a blue coat? Off with it... Sergeant major! Change his coat... the ras...\u201d he did not finish.\n\n\u201cGeneral, I must obey orders, but I am not bound to endure...\u201d D\u00f3lokhov hurriedly interrupted.\n\n\u201cNo talking in the ranks!... No talking, no talking!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot bound to endure insults,\u201d D\u00f3lokhov concluded in loud, ringing tones.\n\nThe eyes of the general and the soldier met. The general became silent, angrily pulling down his tight scarf.\n\n\u201cI request you to have the goodness to change your coat,\u201d he said as he turned away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d shouted the signaler at that moment.\n\nThe regimental commander, flushing, ran to his horse, seized the stirrup with trembling hands, threw his body across the saddle, righted himself, drew his saber, and with a happy and resolute countenance, opening his mouth awry, prepared to shout. The regiment fluttered like a bird preening its plumage and became motionless.\n\n\u201cAtt-ention!\u201d shouted the regimental commander in a soul-shaking voice which expressed joy for himself, severity for the regiment, and welcome for the approaching chief.\n\nAlong the broad country road, edged on both sides by trees, came a high, light blue Viennese cal\u00e8che, slightly creaking on its springs and drawn by six horses at a smart trot. Behind the cal\u00e8che galloped the suite and a convoy of Croats. Beside Kut\u00fazov sat an Austrian general, in a white uniform that looked strange among the Russian black ones. The cal\u00e8che stopped in front of the regiment. Kut\u00fazov and the Austrian general were talking in low voices and Kut\u00fazov smiled slightly as treading heavily he stepped down from the carriage just as if those two thousand men breathlessly gazing at him and the regimental commander did not exist.\n\nThe word of command rang out, and again the regiment quivered, as with a jingling sound it presented arms. Then amidst a dead silence the feeble voice of the commander in chief was heard. The regiment roared, \u201cHealth to your ex... len... len... lency!\u201d and again all became silent. At first Kut\u00fazov stood still while the regiment moved; then he and the general in white, accompanied by the suite, walked between the ranks.\n\nFrom the way the regimental commander saluted the commander in chief and devoured him with his eyes, drawing himself up obsequiously, and from the way he walked through the ranks behind the generals, bending forward and hardly able to restrain his jerky movements, and from the way he darted forward at every word or gesture of the commander in chief, it was evident that he performed his duty as a subordinate with even greater zeal than his duty as a commander. Thanks to the strictness and assiduity of its commander the regiment, in comparison with others that had reached Braunau at the same time, was in splendid condition. There were only 217 sick and stragglers. Everything was in good order except the boots.\n\nKut\u00fazov walked through the ranks, sometimes stopping to say a few friendly words to officers he had known in the Turkish war, sometimes also to the soldiers. Looking at their boots he several times shook his head sadly, pointing them out to the Austrian general with an expression which seemed to say that he was not blaming anyone, but could not help noticing what a bad state of things it was. The regimental commander ran forward on each such occasion, fearing to miss a single word of the commander in chief\u2019s regarding the regiment. Behind Kut\u00fazov, at a distance that allowed every softly spoken word to be heard, followed some twenty men of his suite. These gentlemen talked among themselves and sometimes laughed. Nearest of all to the commander in chief walked a handsome adjutant. This was Prince Bolk\u00f3nski. Beside him was his comrade Nesv\u00edtski, a tall staff officer, extremely stout, with a kindly, smiling, handsome face and moist eyes. Nesv\u00edtski could hardly keep from laughter provoked by a swarthy hussar officer who walked beside him. This hussar, with a grave face and without a smile or a change in the expression of his fixed eyes, watched the regimental commander\u2019s back and mimicked his every movement. Each time the commander started and bent forward, the hussar started and bent forward in exactly the same manner. Nesv\u00edtski laughed and nudged the others to make them look at the wag.\n\nKut\u00fazov walked slowly and languidly past thousands of eyes which were starting from their sockets to watch their chief. On reaching the third company he suddenly stopped. His suite, not having expected this, involuntarily came closer to him.\n\n\u201cAh, Tim\u00f3khin!\u201d said he, recognizing the red-nosed captain who had been reprimanded on account of the blue greatcoat.\n\nOne would have thought it impossible for a man to stretch himself more than Tim\u00f3khin had done when he was reprimanded by the regimental commander, but now that the commander in chief addressed him he drew himself up to such an extent that it seemed he could not have sustained it had the commander in chief continued to look at him, and so Kut\u00fazov, who evidently understood his case and wished him nothing but good, quickly turned away, a scarcely perceptible smile flitting over his scarred and puffy face.\n\n\u201cAnother Ismail comrade,\u201d said he. \u201cA brave officer! Are you satisfied with him?\u201d he asked the regimental commander.\n\nAnd the latter\u2014unconscious that he was being reflected in the hussar officer as in a looking glass\u2014started, moved forward, and answered: \u201cHighly satisfied, your excellency!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe all have our weaknesses,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov smiling and walking away from him. \u201cHe used to have a predilection for Bacchus.\u201d\n\nThe regimental commander was afraid he might be blamed for this and did not answer. The hussar at that moment noticed the face of the red-nosed captain and his drawn-in stomach, and mimicked his expression and pose with such exactitude that Nesv\u00edtski could not help laughing. Kut\u00fazov turned round. The officer evidently had complete control of his face, and while Kut\u00fazov was turning managed to make a grimace and then assume a most serious, deferential, and innocent expression.\n\nThe third company was the last, and Kut\u00fazov pondered, apparently trying to recollect something. Prince Andrew stepped forward from among the suite and said in French:\n\n\u201cYou told me to remind you of the officer D\u00f3lokhov, reduced to the ranks in this regiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is D\u00f3lokhov?\u201d asked Kut\u00fazov.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov, who had already changed into a soldier\u2019s gray greatcoat, did not wait to be called. The shapely figure of the fair-haired soldier, with his clear blue eyes, stepped forward from the ranks, went up to the commander in chief, and presented arms.\n\n\u201cHave you a complaint to make?\u201d Kut\u00fazov asked with a slight frown.\n\n\u201cThis is D\u00f3lokhov,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov. \u201cI hope this will be a lesson to you. Do your duty. The Emperor is gracious, and I shan\u2019t forget you if you deserve well.\u201d\n\nThe clear blue eyes looked at the commander in chief just as boldly as they had looked at the regimental commander, seeming by their expression to tear open the veil of convention that separates a commander in chief so widely from a private.\n\n\u201cOne thing I ask of your excellency,\u201d D\u00f3lokhov said in his firm, ringing, deliberate voice. \u201cI ask an opportunity to atone for my fault and prove my devotion to His Majesty the Emperor and to Russia!\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov turned away. The same smile of the eyes with which he had turned from Captain Tim\u00f3khin again flitted over his face. He turned away with a grimace as if to say that everything D\u00f3lokhov had said to him and everything he could say had long been known to him, that he was weary of it and it was not at all what he wanted. He turned away and went to the carriage.\n\nThe regiment broke up into companies, which went to their appointed quarters near Braunau, where they hoped to receive boots and clothes and to rest after their hard marches.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t bear me a grudge, Prokh\u00f3r Ign\u00e1tych?\u201d said the regimental commander, overtaking the third company on its way to its quarters and riding up to Captain Tim\u00f3khin who was walking in front. (The regimental commander\u2019s face now that the inspection was happily over beamed with irrepressible delight.) \u201cIt\u2019s in the Emperor\u2019s service... it can\u2019t be helped... one is sometimes a bit hasty on parade... I am the first to apologize, you know me!... He was very pleased!\u201d And he held out his hand to the captain.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention it, General, as if I\u2019d be so bold!\u201d replied the captain, his nose growing redder as he gave a smile which showed where two front teeth were missing that had been knocked out by the butt end of a gun at Ismail.\n\n\u201cAnd tell Mr. D\u00f3lokhov that I won\u2019t forget him\u2014he may be quite easy. And tell me, please\u2014I\u2019ve been meaning to ask\u2014how is he behaving himself, and in general...\u201d\n\n\u201cAs far as the service goes he is quite punctilious, your excellency; but his character...\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin.\n\n\u201cAnd what about his character?\u201d asked the regimental commander.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s different on different days,\u201d answered the captain. \u201cOne day he is sensible, well educated, and good-natured, and the next he\u2019s a wild beast.... In Poland, if you please, he nearly killed a Jew.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, well!\u201d remarked the regimental commander. \u201cStill, one must have pity on a young man in misfortune. You know he has important connections... Well, then, you just...\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, your excellency,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin, showing by his smile that he understood his commander\u2019s wish.\n\n\u201cWell, of course, of course!\u201d\n\nThe regimental commander sought out D\u00f3lokhov in the ranks and, reining in his horse, said to him:\n\n\u201cAfter the next affair... epaulettes.\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov looked round but did not say anything, nor did the mocking smile on his lips change.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all right,\u201d continued the regimental commander. \u201cA cup of vodka for the men from me,\u201d he added so that the soldiers could hear. \u201cI thank you all! God be praised!\u201d and he rode past that company and overtook the next one.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s really a good fellow, one can serve under him,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin to the subaltern beside him.\n\n\u201cIn a word, a hearty one...\u201d said the subaltern, laughing (the regimental commander was nicknamed King of Hearts).\n\nThe cheerful mood of their officers after the inspection infected the soldiers. The company marched on gaily. The soldiers\u2019 voices could be heard on every side.\n\n\u201cAnd they said Kut\u00fazov was blind of one eye?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so he is! Quite blind!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, friend, he is sharper-eyed than you are. Boots and leg bands... he noticed everything...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he looked at my feet, friend... well, thinks I...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that other one with him, the Austrian, looked as if he were smeared with chalk\u2014as white as flour! I suppose they polish him up as they do the guns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, F\u00e9deshon!... Did he say when the battles are to begin? You were near him. Everybody said that Buonaparte himself was at Braunau.\u201d\n\n\u201cBuonaparte himself!... Just listen to the fool, what he doesn\u2019t know! The Prussians are up in arms now. The Austrians, you see, are putting them down. When they\u2019ve been put down, the war with Buonaparte will begin. And he says Buonaparte is in Braunau! Shows you\u2019re a fool. You\u2019d better listen more carefully!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat devils these quartermasters are! See, the fifth company is turning into the village already... they will have their buckwheat cooked before we reach our quarters.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me a biscuit, you devil!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd did you give me tobacco yesterday? That\u2019s just it, friend! Ah, well, never mind, here you are.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey might call a halt here or we\u2019ll have to do another four miles without eating.\u201d\n\n\u201cWasn\u2019t it fine when those Germans gave us lifts! You just sit still and are drawn along.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd here, friend, the people are quite beggarly. There they all seemed to be Poles\u2014all under the Russian crown\u2014but here they\u2019re all regular Germans.\u201d\n\n\u201cSingers to the front\u201d came the captain\u2019s order.\n\nAnd from the different ranks some twenty men ran to the front. A drummer, their leader, turned round facing the singers, and flourishing his arm, began a long-drawn-out soldiers\u2019 song, commencing with the words: \u201cMorning dawned, the sun was rising,\u201d and concluding: \u201cOn then, brothers, on to glory, led by Father K\u00e1menski.\u201d This song had been composed in the Turkish campaign and now being sung in Austria, the only change being that the words \u201cFather K\u00e1menski\u201d were replaced by \u201cFather Kut\u00fazov.\u201d\n\nHaving jerked out these last words as soldiers do and waved his arms as if flinging something to the ground, the drummer\u2014a lean, handsome soldier of forty\u2014looked sternly at the singers and screwed up his eyes. Then having satisfied himself that all eyes were fixed on him, he raised both arms as if carefully lifting some invisible but precious object above his head and, holding it there for some seconds, suddenly flung it down and began:\n\n\u201cOh, my bower, oh, my bower...!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my bower new...!\u201d chimed in twenty voices, and the castanet player, in spite of the burden of his equipment, rushed out to the front and, walking backwards before the company, jerked his shoulders and flourished his castanets as if threatening someone. The soldiers, swinging their arms and keeping time spontaneously, marched with long steps. Behind the company the sound of wheels, the creaking of springs, and the tramp of horses\u2019 hoofs were heard. Kut\u00fazov and his suite were returning to the town. The commander in chief made a sign that the men should continue to march at ease, and he and all his suite showed pleasure at the sound of the singing and the sight of the dancing soldier and the gay and smartly marching men. In the second file from the right flank, beside which the carriage passed the company, a blue-eyed soldier involuntarily attracted notice. It was D\u00f3lokhov marching with particular grace and boldness in time to the song and looking at those driving past as if he pitied all who were not at that moment marching with the company. The hussar cornet of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suite who had mimicked the regimental commander, fell back from the carriage and rode up to D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nHussar cornet Zherk\u00f3v had at one time, in Petersburg, belonged to the wild set led by D\u00f3lokhov. Zherk\u00f3v had met D\u00f3lokhov abroad as a private and had not seen fit to recognize him. But now that Kut\u00fazov had spoken to the gentleman ranker, he addressed him with the cordiality of an old friend.\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, how are you?\u201d said he through the singing, making his horse keep pace with the company.\n\n\u201cHow am I?\u201d D\u00f3lokhov answered coldly. \u201cI am as you see.\u201d\n\nThe lively song gave a special flavor to the tone of free and easy gaiety with which Zherk\u00f3v spoke, and to the intentional coldness of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s reply.\n\n\u201cAnd how do you get on with the officers?\u201d inquired Zherk\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cAll right. They are good fellows. And how have you wriggled onto the staff?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was attached; I\u2019m on duty.\u201d\n\nBoth were silent.\n\n\u201cShe let the hawk fly upward from her wide right sleeve,\u201d went the song, arousing an involuntary sensation of courage and cheerfulness. Their conversation would probably have been different but for the effect of that song.\n\n\u201cIs it true that Austrians have been beaten?\u201d asked D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cThe devil only knows! They say so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad,\u201d answered D\u00f3lokhov briefly and clearly, as the song demanded.\n\n\u201cI say, come round some evening and we\u2019ll have a game of faro!\u201d said Zherk\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWhy, have you too much money?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t. I\u2019ve sworn not to. I won\u2019t drink and won\u2019t play till I get reinstated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s only till the first engagement.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall see.\u201d\n\nThey were again silent.\n\n\u201cCome if you need anything. One can at least be of use on the staff...\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov smiled. \u201cDon\u2019t trouble. If I want anything, I won\u2019t beg\u2014I\u2019ll take it!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, never mind; I only...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I only...\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-by.\u201d\n\n\u201cGood health...\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long, long way.\nTo my native land...\u201d\n\n\nZherk\u00f3v touched his horse with the spurs; it pranced excitedly from foot to foot uncertain with which to start, then settled down, galloped past the company, and overtook the carriage, still keeping time to the song.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn returning from the review, Kut\u00fazov took the Austrian general into his private room and, calling his adjutant, asked for some papers relating to the condition of the troops on their arrival, and the letters that had come from the Archduke Ferdinand, who was in command of the advanced army. Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski came into the room with the required papers. Kut\u00fazov and the Austrian member of the Hofkriegsrath were sitting at the table on which a plan was spread out.\n\n\u201cAh!...\u201d said Kut\u00fazov glancing at Bolk\u00f3nski as if by this exclamation he was asking the adjutant to wait, and he went on with the conversation in French.\n\n\u201cAll I can say, General,\u201d said he with a pleasant elegance of expression and intonation that obliged one to listen to each deliberately spoken word. It was evident that Kut\u00fazov himself listened with pleasure to his own voice. \u201cAll I can say, General, is that if the matter depended on my personal wishes, the will of His Majesty the Emperor Francis would have been fulfilled long ago. I should long ago have joined the archduke. And believe me on my honour that to me personally it would be a pleasure to hand over the supreme command of the army into the hands of a better informed and more skillful general\u2014of whom Austria has so many\u2014and to lay down all this heavy responsibility. But circumstances are sometimes too strong for us, General.\u201d\n\nAnd Kut\u00fazov smiled in a way that seemed to say, \u201cYou are quite at liberty not to believe me and I don\u2019t even care whether you do or not, but you have no grounds for telling me so. And that is the whole point.\u201d\n\nThe Austrian general looked dissatisfied, but had no option but to reply in the same tone.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary,\u201d he said, in a querulous and angry tone that contrasted with his flattering words, \u201con the contrary, your excellency\u2019s participation in the common action is highly valued by His Majesty; but we think the present delay is depriving the splendid Russian troops and their commander of the laurels they have been accustomed to win in their battles,\u201d he concluded his evidently prearranged sentence.\n\nKut\u00fazov bowed with the same smile.\n\n\u201cBut that is my conviction, and judging by the last letter with which His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand has honored me, I imagine that the Austrian troops, under the direction of so skillful a leader as General Mack, have by now already gained a decisive victory and no longer need our aid,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov.\n\nThe general frowned. Though there was no definite news of an Austrian defeat, there were many circumstances confirming the unfavorable rumors that were afloat, and so Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suggestion of an Austrian victory sounded much like irony. But Kut\u00fazov went on blandly smiling with the same expression, which seemed to say that he had a right to suppose so. And, in fact, the last letter he had received from Mack\u2019s army informed him of a victory and stated strategically the position of the army was very favorable.\n\n\u201cGive me that letter,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov turning to Prince Andrew. \u201cPlease have a look at it\u201d\u2014and Kut\u00fazov with an ironical smile about the corners of his mouth read to the Austrian general the following passage, in German, from the Archduke Ferdinand\u2019s letter:\n\nWe have fully concentrated forces of nearly seventy thousand men with which to attack and defeat the enemy should he cross the Lech. Also, as we are masters of Ulm, we cannot be deprived of the advantage of commanding both sides of the Danube, so that should the enemy not cross the Lech, we can cross the Danube, throw ourselves on his line of communications, recross the river lower down, and frustrate his intention should he try to direct his whole force against our faithful ally. We shall therefore confidently await the moment when the Imperial Russian army will be fully equi", "sequence": 2}, {"offset": 300000, "text": "pped, and shall then, in conjunction with it, easily find a way to prepare for the enemy the fate he deserves.\n\nKut\u00fazov sighed deeply on finishing this paragraph and looked at the member of the Hofkriegsrath mildly and attentively.\n\n\u201cBut you know the wise maxim your excellency, advising one to expect the worst,\u201d said the Austrian general, evidently wishing to have done with jests and to come to business. He involuntarily looked round at the aide-de-camp.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, General,\u201d interrupted Kut\u00fazov, also turning to Prince Andrew. \u201cLook here, my dear fellow, get from Kozl\u00f3vski all the reports from our scouts. Here are two letters from Count Nostitz and here is one from His Highness the Archduke Ferdinand and here are these,\u201d he said, handing him several papers, \u201cmake a neat memorandum in French out of all this, showing all the news we have had of the movements of the Austrian army, and then give it to his excellency.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew bowed his head in token of having understood from the first not only what had been said but also what Kut\u00fazov would have liked to tell him. He gathered up the papers and with a bow to both, stepped softly over the carpet and went out into the waiting room.\n\nThough not much time had passed since Prince Andrew had left Russia, he had changed greatly during that period. In the expression of his face, in his movements, in his walk, scarcely a trace was left of his former affected languor and indolence. He now looked like a man who has time to think of the impression he makes on others, but is occupied with agreeable and interesting work. His face expressed more satisfaction with himself and those around him, his smile and glance were brighter and more attractive.\n\nKut\u00fazov, whom he had overtaken in Poland, had received him very kindly, promised not to forget him, distinguished him above the other adjutants, and had taken him to Vienna and given him the more serious commissions. From Vienna Kut\u00fazov wrote to his old comrade, Prince Andrew\u2019s father.\n\nYour son bids fair to become an officer distinguished by his industry, firmness, and expedition. I consider myself fortunate to have such a subordinate by me.\n\nOn Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff, among his fellow officers and in the army generally, Prince Andrew had, as he had had in Petersburg society, two quite opposite reputations. Some, a minority, acknowledged him to be different from themselves and from everyone else, expected great things of him, listened to him, admired, and imitated him, and with them Prince Andrew was natural and pleasant. Others, the majority, disliked him and considered him conceited, cold, and disagreeable. But among these people Prince Andrew knew how to take his stand so that they respected and even feared him.\n\nComing out of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s room into the waiting room with the papers in his hand Prince Andrew came up to his comrade, the aide-de-camp on duty, Kozl\u00f3vski, who was sitting at the window with a book.\n\n\u201cWell, Prince?\u201d asked Kozl\u00f3vski.\n\n\u201cI am ordered to write a memorandum explaining why we are not advancing.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why is it?\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cAny news from Mack?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were true that he has been beaten, news would have come.\u201d\n\n\u201cProbably,\u201d said Prince Andrew moving toward the outer door.\n\nBut at that instant a tall Austrian general in a greatcoat, with the order of Maria Theresa on his neck and a black bandage round his head, who had evidently just arrived, entered quickly, slamming the door. Prince Andrew stopped short.\n\n\u201cCommander in Chief Kut\u00fazov?\u201d said the newly arrived general speaking quickly with a harsh German accent, looking to both sides and advancing straight toward the inner door.\n\n\u201cThe commander in chief is engaged,\u201d said Kozl\u00f3vski, going hurriedly up to the unknown general and blocking his way to the door. \u201cWhom shall I announce?\u201d\n\nThe unknown general looked disdainfully down at Kozl\u00f3vski, who was rather short, as if surprised that anyone should not know him.\n\n\u201cThe commander in chief is engaged,\u201d repeated Kozl\u00f3vski calmly.\n\nThe general\u2019s face clouded, his lips quivered and trembled. He took out a notebook, hurriedly scribbled something in pencil, tore out the leaf, gave it to Kozl\u00f3vski, stepped quickly to the window, and threw himself into a chair, gazing at those in the room as if asking, \u201cWhy do they look at me?\u201d Then he lifted his head, stretched his neck as if he intended to say something, but immediately, with affected indifference, began to hum to himself, producing a queer sound which immediately broke off. The door of the private room opened and Kut\u00fazov appeared in the doorway. The general with the bandaged head bent forward as though running away from some danger, and, making long, quick strides with his thin legs, went up to Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cVous voyez le malheureux Mack,\u201d he uttered in a broken voice.\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s face as he stood in the open doorway remained perfectly immobile for a few moments. Then wrinkles ran over his face like a wave and his forehead became smooth again, he bowed his head respectfully, closed his eyes, silently let Mack enter his room before him, and closed the door himself behind him.\n\nThe report which had been circulated that the Austrians had been beaten and that the whole army had surrendered at Ulm proved to be correct. Within half an hour adjutants had been sent in various directions with orders which showed that the Russian troops, who had hitherto been inactive, would also soon have to meet the enemy.\n\nPrince Andrew was one of those rare staff officers whose chief interest lay in the general progress of the war. When he saw Mack and heard the details of his disaster he understood that half the campaign was lost, understood all the difficulties of the Russian army\u2019s position, and vividly imagined what awaited it and the part he would have to play. Involuntarily he felt a joyful agitation at the thought of the humiliation of arrogant Austria and that in a week\u2019s time he might, perhaps, see and take part in the first Russian encounter with the French since Suv\u00f3rov met them. He feared that Bonaparte\u2019s genius might outweigh all the courage of the Russian troops, and at the same time could not admit the idea of his hero being disgraced.\n\nExcited and irritated by these thoughts Prince Andrew went toward his room to write to his father, to whom he wrote every day. In the corridor he met Nesv\u00edtski, with whom he shared a room, and the wag Zherk\u00f3v; they were as usual laughing.\n\n\u201cWhy are you so glum?\u201d asked Nesv\u00edtski noticing Prince Andrew\u2019s pale face and glittering eyes.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gay about,\u201d answered Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\nJust as Prince Andrew metJust as Prince Andrew met Nesv\u00edtski and Zherk\u00f3v, there came toward them from the other end of the corridor, Strauch, an Austrian general who was on Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff in charge of the provisioning of the Russian army, and the member of the Hofkriegsrath who had arrived the previous evening. There was room enough in the wide corridor for the generals to pass the three officers quite easily, but Zherk\u00f3v, pushing Nesv\u00edtski aside with his arm, said in a breathless voice,\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re coming!... they\u2019re coming!... Stand aside, make way, please make way!\u201d\n\nThe generals were passing by, looking as if they wished to avoid embarrassing attentions. On the face of the wag Zherk\u00f3v there suddenly appeared a stupid smile of glee which he seemed unable to suppress.\n\n\u201cYour excellency,\u201d said he in German, stepping forward and addressing the Austrian general, \u201cI have the honor to congratulate you.\u201d\n\nHe bowed his head and scraped first with one foot and then with the other, awkwardly, like a child at a dancing lesson.\n\nThe member of the Hofkriegsrath looked at him severely but, seeing the seriousness of his stupid smile, could not but give him a moment\u2019s attention. He screwed up his eyes showing that he was listening.\n\n\u201cI have the honor to congratulate you. General Mack has arrived, quite well, only a little bruised just here,\u201d he added, pointing with a beaming smile to his head.\n\nThe general frowned, turned away, and went on.\n\n\u201cGott, wie naiv!\u201d said he angrily, after he had gone a few steps.\n\nNesv\u00edtski with a laugh threw his arms round Prince Andrew, but Bolk\u00f3nski, turning still paler, pushed him away with an angry look and turned to Zherk\u00f3v. The nervous irritation aroused by the appearance of Mack, the news of his defeat, and the thought of what lay before the Russian army found vent in anger at Zherk\u00f3v\u2019s untimely jest.\n\n\u201cIf you, sir, choose to make a buffoon of yourself,\u201d he said sharply, with a slight trembling of the lower jaw, \u201cI can\u2019t prevent your doing so; but I warn you that if you dare to play the fool in my presence, I will teach you to behave yourself.\u201d\n\nNesv\u00edtski and Zherk\u00f3v were so surprised by this outburst that they gazed at Bolk\u00f3nski silently with wide-open eyes.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter? I only congratulated them,\u201d said Zherk\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cI am not jesting with you; please be silent!\u201d cried Bolk\u00f3nski, and taking Nesv\u00edtski\u2019s arm he left Zherk\u00f3v, who did not know what to say.\n\n\u201cCome, what\u2019s the matter, old fellow?\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski trying to soothe him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d exclaimed Prince Andrew standing still in his excitement. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that either we are officers serving our Tsar and our country, rejoicing in the successes and grieving at the misfortunes of our common cause, or we are merely lackeys who care nothing for their master\u2019s business. Quarante mille hommes massacr\u00e9s et l\u2019arm\u00e9e de nos alli\u00e9s d\u00e9truite, et vous trouvez l\u00e0 le mot pour rire,\u201d he said, as if strengthening his views by this French sentence. \u201cC\u2019est bien pour un gar\u00e7on de rien comme cet individu dont vous avez fait un ami, mais pas pour vous, pas pour vous. Only a hobbledehoy could amuse himself in this way,\u201d he added in Russian\u2014but pronouncing the word with a French accent\u2014having noticed that Zherk\u00f3v could still hear him.\n\nHe waited a moment to see whether the cornet would answer, but he turned and went out of the corridor.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe P\u00e1vlograd Hussars were stationed two miles from Braunau. The squadron in which Nicholas Rost\u00f3v served as a cadet was quartered in the German village of Salzeneck. The best quarters in the village were assigned to cavalry-captain Den\u00edsov, the squadron commander, known throughout the whole cavalry division as V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov. Cadet Rost\u00f3v, ever since he had overtaken the regiment in Poland, had lived with the squadron commander.\n\nOn October 11, the day when all was astir at headquarters over the news of Mack\u2019s defeat, the camp life of the officers of this squadron was proceeding as usual. Den\u00edsov, who had been losing at cards all night, had not yet come home when Rost\u00f3v rode back early in the morning from a foraging expedition. Rost\u00f3v in his cadet uniform, with a jerk to his horse, rode up to the porch, swung his leg over the saddle with a supple youthful movement, stood for a moment in the stirrup as if loathe to part from his horse, and at last sprang down and called to his orderly.\n\n\u201cAh, Bondar\u00e9nko, dear friend!\u201d said he to the hussar who rushed up headlong to the horse. \u201cWalk him up and down, my dear fellow,\u201d he continued, with that gay brotherly cordiality which goodhearted young people show to everyone when they are happy.\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency,\u201d answered the Ukrainian gaily, tossing his head.\n\n\u201cMind, walk him up and down well!\u201d\n\nAnother hussar also rushed toward the horse, but Bondar\u00e9nko had already thrown the reins of the snaffle bridle over the horse\u2019s head. It was evident that the cadet was liberal with his tips and that it paid to serve him. Rost\u00f3v patted the horse\u2019s neck and then his flank, and lingered for a moment.\n\n\u201cSplendid! What a horse he will be!\u201d he thought with a smile, and holding up his saber, his spurs jingling, he ran up the steps of the porch. His landlord, who in a waistcoat and a pointed cap, pitchfork in hand, was clearing manure from the cowhouse, looked out, and his face immediately brightened on seeing Rost\u00f3v. \u201cSch\u00f6n gut Morgen! Sch\u00f6n gut Morgen!\u201d he said winking with a merry smile, evidently pleased to greet the young man.\n\n\u201cSchon fleissig?\u201d said Rost\u00f3v with the same gay brotherly smile which did not leave his eager face. \u201cHoch Oestreicher! Hoch Russen! Kaiser Alexander hoch!\u201d said he, quoting words often repeated by the German landlord.\n\nThe German laughed, came out of the cowshed, pulled off his cap, and waving it above his head cried:\n\n\u201cUnd die ganze Welt hoch!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v waved his cap above his head like the German and cried laughing, \u201cUnd vivat die ganze Welt!\u201d Though neither the German cleaning his cowshed nor Rost\u00f3v back with his platoon from foraging for hay had any reason for rejoicing, they looked at each other with joyful delight and brotherly love, wagged their heads in token of their mutual affection, and parted smiling, the German returning to his cowshed and Rost\u00f3v going to the cottage he occupied with Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cWhat about your master?\u201d he asked Lavr\u00fashka, Den\u00edsov\u2019s orderly, whom all the regiment knew for a rogue.\n\n\u201cHasn\u2019t been in since the evening. Must have been losing,\u201d answered Lavr\u00fashka. \u201cI know by now, if he wins he comes back early to brag about it, but if he stays out till morning it means he\u2019s lost and will come back in a rage. Will you have coffee?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, bring some.\u201d\n\nTen minutes later Lavr\u00fashka brought the coffee. \u201cHe\u2019s coming!\u201d said he. \u201cNow for trouble!\u201d Rost\u00f3v looked out of the window and saw Den\u00edsov coming home. Den\u00edsov was a small man with a red face, sparkling black eyes, and black tousled mustache and hair. He wore an unfastened cloak, wide breeches hanging down in creases, and a crumpled shako on the back of his head. He came up to the porch gloomily, hanging his head.\n\n\u201cLavw\u00faska!\u201d he shouted loudly and angrily, \u201ctake it off, blockhead!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I am taking it off,\u201d replied Lavr\u00fashka\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re up already,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, entering the room.\n\n\u201cLong ago,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v, \u201cI have already been for the hay, and have seen Fr\u00e4ulein Mathilde.\u201d\n\n\u201cWeally! And I\u2019ve been losing, bwother. I lost yesterday like a damned fool!\u201d cried Den\u00edsov, not pronouncing his r\u2019s. \u201cSuch ill luck! Such ill luck. As soon as you left, it began and went on. Hullo there! Tea!\u201d\n\nPuckering up his face though smiling, and showing his short strong teeth, he began with stubby fingers of both hands to ruffle up his thick tangled black hair.\n\n\u201cAnd what devil made me go to that wat?\u201d (an officer nicknamed \u201cthe rat\u201d) he said, rubbing his forehead and whole face with both hands. \u201cJust fancy, he didn\u2019t let me win a single cahd, not one cahd.\u201d\n\nHe took the lighted pipe that was offered to him, gripped it in his fist, and tapped it on the floor, making the sparks fly, while he continued to shout.\n\n\u201cHe lets one win the singles and collahs it as soon as one doubles it; gives the singles and snatches the doubles!\u201d\n\nHe scattered the burning tobacco, smashed the pipe, and threw it away. Then he remained silent for a while, and all at once looked cheerfully with his glittering, black eyes at Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cIf at least we had some women here; but there\u2019s nothing foh one to do but dwink. If we could only get to fighting soon. Hullo, who\u2019s there?\u201d he said, turning to the door as he heard a tread of heavy boots and the clinking of spurs that came to a stop, and a respectful cough.\n\n\u201cThe squadron quartermaster!\u201d said Lavr\u00fashka.\n\nDen\u00edsov\u2019s face puckered still more.\n\n\u201cWetched!\u201d he muttered, throwing down a purse with some gold in it. \u201cWost\u00f3v, deah fellow, just see how much there is left and shove the purse undah the pillow,\u201d he said, and went out to the quartermaster.\n\nRost\u00f3v took the money and, mechanically arranging the old and new coins in separate piles, began counting them.\n\n\u201cAh! Tely\u00e1nin! How d\u2019ye do? They plucked me last night,\u201d came Den\u00edsov\u2019s voice from the next room.\n\n\u201cWhere? At Bykov\u2019s, at the rat\u2019s... I knew it,\u201d replied a piping voice, and Lieutenant Tely\u00e1nin, a small officer of the same squadron, entered the room.\n\nRost\u00f3v thrust the purse under the pillow and shook the damp little hand which was offered him. Tely\u00e1nin for some reason had been transferred from the Guards just before this campaign. He behaved very well in the regiment but was not liked; Rost\u00f3v especially detested him and was unable to overcome or conceal his groundless antipathy to the man.\n\n\u201cWell, young cavalryman, how is my Rook behaving?\u201d he asked. (Rook was a young horse Tely\u00e1nin had sold to Rost\u00f3v.)\n\nThe lieutenant never looked the man he was speaking to straight in the face; his eyes continually wandered from one object to another.\n\n\u201cI saw you riding this morning...\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s all right, a good horse,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v, though the horse for which he had paid seven hundred rubbles was not worth half that sum. \u201cHe\u2019s begun to go a little lame on the left foreleg,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cThe hoof\u2019s cracked! That\u2019s nothing. I\u2019ll teach you what to do and show you what kind of rivet to use.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, please do,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show you, I\u2019ll show you! It\u2019s not a secret. And it\u2019s a horse you\u2019ll thank me for.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019ll have it brought round,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v wishing to avoid Tely\u00e1nin, and he went out to give the order.\n\nIn the passage Den\u00edsov, with a pipe, was squatting on the threshold facing the quartermaster who was reporting to him. On seeing Rost\u00f3v, Den\u00edsov screwed up his face and pointing over his shoulder with his thumb to the room where Tely\u00e1nin was sitting, he frowned and gave a shudder of disgust.\n\n\u201cUgh! I don\u2019t like that fellow,\u201d he said, regardless of the quartermaster\u2019s presence.\n\nRost\u00f3v shrugged his shoulders as much as to say: \u201cNor do I, but what\u2019s one to do?\u201d and, having given his order, he returned to Tely\u00e1nin.\n\nTely\u00e1nin was sitting in the same indolent pose in which Rost\u00f3v had left him, rubbing his small white hands.\n\n\u201cWell there certainly are disgusting people,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v as he entered.\n\n\u201cHave you told them to bring the horse?\u201d asked Tely\u00e1nin, getting up and looking carelessly about him.\n\n\u201cI have.\u201d\n\n\u201cLet us go ourselves. I only came round to ask Den\u00edsov about yesterday\u2019s order. Have you got it, Den\u00edsov?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot yet. But where are you off to?\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to teach this young man how to shoe a horse,\u201d said Tely\u00e1nin.\n\nThey went through the porch and into the stable. The lieutenant explained how to rivet the hoof and went away to his own quarters.\n\nWhen Rost\u00f3v went back there was a bottle of vodka and a sausage on the table. Den\u00edsov was sitting there scratching with his pen on a sheet of paper. He looked gloomily in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face and said: \u201cI am witing to her.\u201d\n\nHe leaned his elbows on the table with his pen in his hand and, evidently glad of a chance to say quicker in words what he wanted to write, told Rost\u00f3v the contents of his letter.\n\n\u201cYou see, my fwiend,\u201d he said, \u201cwe sleep when we don\u2019t love. We are childwen of the dust... but one falls in love and one is a God, one is pua\u2019 as on the fihst day of cweation... Who\u2019s that now? Send him to the devil, I\u2019m busy!\u201d he shouted to Lavr\u00fashka, who went up to him not in the least abashed.\n\n\u201cWho should it be? You yourself told him to come. It\u2019s the quartermaster for the money.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov frowned and was about to shout some reply but stopped.\n\n\u201cWetched business,\u201d he muttered to himself. \u201cHow much is left in the puhse?\u201d he asked, turning to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cSeven new and three old imperials.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s wetched! Well, what are you standing there for, you sca\u2019cwow? Call the quahtehmasteh,\u201d he shouted to Lavr\u00fashka.\n\n\u201cPlease, Den\u00edsov, let me lend you some: I have some, you know,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, blushing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t like bowwowing from my own fellows, I don\u2019t,\u201d growled Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cBut if you won\u2019t accept money from me like a comrade, you will offend me. Really I have some,\u201d Rost\u00f3v repeated.\n\n\u201cNo, I tell you.\u201d\n\nAnd Den\u00edsov went to the bed to get the purse from under the pillow.\n\n\u201cWhere have you put it, Wost\u00f3v?\u201d\n\n\u201cUnder the lower pillow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not there.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov threw both pillows on the floor. The purse was not there.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a miwacle.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait, haven\u2019t you dropped it?\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, picking up the pillows one at a time and shaking them.\n\nHe pulled off the quilt and shook it. The purse was not there.\n\n\u201cDear me, can I have forgotten? No, I remember thinking that you kept it under your head like a treasure,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI put it just here. Where is it?\u201d he asked, turning to Lavr\u00fashka.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been in the room. It must be where you put it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it isn\u2019t?...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always like that; you thwow a thing down anywhere and forget it. Feel in your pockets.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, if I hadn\u2019t thought of it being a treasure,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, \u201cbut I remember putting it there.\u201d\n\nLavr\u00fashka turned all the bedding over, looked under the bed and under the table, searched everywhere, and stood still in the middle of the room. Den\u00edsov silently watched Lavr\u00fashka\u2019s movements, and when the latter threw up his arms in surprise saying it was nowhere to be found Den\u00edsov glanced at Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWost\u00f3v, you\u2019ve not been playing schoolboy twicks...\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v felt Den\u00edsov\u2019s gaze fixed on him, raised his eyes, and instantly dropped them again. All the blood which had seemed congested somewhere below his throat rushed to his face and eyes. He could not draw breath.\n\n\u201cAnd there hasn\u2019t been anyone in the room except the lieutenant and yourselves. It must be here somewhere,\u201d said Lavr\u00fashka.\n\n\u201cNow then, you devil\u2019s puppet, look alive and hunt for it!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, suddenly, turning purple and rushing at the man with a threatening gesture. \u201cIf the purse isn\u2019t found I\u2019ll flog you, I\u2019ll flog you all.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, his eyes avoiding Den\u00edsov, began buttoning his coat, buckled on his saber, and put on his cap.\n\n\u201cI must have that purse, I tell you,\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, shaking his orderly by the shoulders and knocking him against the wall.\n\n\u201cDen\u00edsov, let him alone, I know who has taken it,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, going toward the door without raising his eyes. Den\u00edsov paused, thought a moment, and, evidently understanding what Rost\u00f3v hinted at, seized his arm.\n\n\u201cNonsense!\u201d he cried, and the veins on his forehead and neck stood out like cords. \u201cYou are mad, I tell you. I won\u2019t allow it. The purse is here! I\u2019ll flay this scoundwel alive, and it will be found.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know who has taken it,\u201d repeated Rost\u00f3v in an unsteady voice, and went to the door.\n\n\u201cAnd I tell you, don\u2019t you dahe to do it!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, rushing at the cadet to restrain him.\n\nBut Rost\u00f3v pulled away his arm and, with as much anger as though Den\u00edsov were his worst enemy, firmly fixed his eyes directly on his face.\n\n\u201cDo you understand what you\u2019re saying?\u201d he said in a trembling voice. \u201cThere was no one else in the room except myself. So that if it is not so, then...\u201d\n\nHe could not finish, and ran out of the room.\n\n\u201cAh, may the devil take you and evewybody,\u201d were the last words Rost\u00f3v heard.\n\nRost\u00f3v went to Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s quarters.\n\n\u201cThe master is not in, he\u2019s gone to headquarters,\u201d said Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s orderly. \u201cHas something happened?\u201d he added, surprised at the cadet\u2019s troubled face.\n\n\u201cNo, nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve only just missed him,\u201d said the orderly.\n\nThe headquarters were situated two miles away from Salzeneck, and Rost\u00f3v, without returning home, took a horse and rode there. There was an inn in the village which the officers frequented. Rost\u00f3v rode up to it and saw Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s horse at the porch.\n\nIn the second room of the inn the lieutenant was sitting over a dish of sausages and a bottle of wine.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019ve come here too, young man!\u201d he said, smiling and raising his eyebrows.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v as if it cost him a great deal to utter the word; and he sat down at the nearest table.\n\nBoth were silent. There were two Germans and a Russian officer in the room. No one spoke and the only sounds heard were the clatter of knives and the munching of the lieutenant.\n\nWhen Tely\u00e1nin had finished his lunch he took out of his pocket a double purse and, drawing its rings aside with his small, white, turned-up fingers, drew out a gold imperial, and lifting his eyebrows gave it to the waiter.\n\n\u201cPlease be quick,\u201d he said.\n\nThe coin was a new one. Rost\u00f3v rose and went up to Tely\u00e1nin.\n\n\u201cAllow me to look at your purse,\u201d he said in a low, almost inaudible, voice.\n\nWith shifting eyes but eyebrows still raised, Tely\u00e1nin handed him the purse.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s a nice purse. Yes, yes,\u201d he said, growing suddenly pale, and added, \u201cLook at it, young man.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v took the purse in his hand, examined it and the money in it, and looked at Tely\u00e1nin. The lieutenant was looking about in his usual way and suddenly seemed to grow very merry.\n\n\u201cIf we get to Vienna I\u2019ll get rid of it there but in these wretched little towns there\u2019s nowhere to spend it,\u201d said he. \u201cWell, let me have it, young man, I\u2019m going.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v did not speak.\n\n\u201cAnd you? Are you going to have lunch too? They feed you quite decently here,\u201d continued Tely\u00e1nin. \u201cNow then, let me have it.\u201d\n\nHe stretched out his hand to take hold of the purse. Rost\u00f3v let go of it. Tely\u00e1nin took the purse and began carelessly slipping it into the pocket of his riding breeches, with his eyebrows lifted and his mouth slightly open, as if to say, \u201cYes, yes, I am putting my purse in my pocket and that\u2019s quite simple and is no one else\u2019s business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, young man?\u201d he said with a sigh, and from under his lifted brows he glanced into Rost\u00f3v\u2019s eyes.\n\nSome flash as of an electric spark shot from Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s eyes to Rost\u00f3v\u2019s and back, and back again and again in an instant.\n\n\u201cCome here,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, catching hold of Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s arm and almost dragging him to the window. \u201cThat money is Den\u00edsov\u2019s; you took it...\u201d he whispered just above Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s ear.\n\n\u201cWhat? What? How dare you? What?\u201d said Tely\u00e1nin.\n\nBut these words came like a piteous, despairing cry and an entreaty for pardon. As soon as Rost\u00f3v heard them, an enormous load of doubt fell from him. He was glad, and at the same instant began to pity the miserable man who stood before him, but the task he had begun had to be completed.\n\n\u201cHeaven only knows what the people here may imagine,\u201d muttered Tely\u00e1nin, taking up his cap and moving toward a small empty room. \u201cWe must have an explanation...\u201d\n\n\u201cI know it and shall prove it,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cI...\u201d\n\nEvery muscle of Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s pale, terrified face began to quiver, his eyes still shifted from side to side but with a downward look not rising to Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face, and his sobs were audible.\n\n\u201cCount!... Don\u2019t ruin a young fellow... here is this wretched money, take it...\u201d He threw it on the table. \u201cI have an old father and mother!...\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v took the money, avoiding Tely\u00e1nin\u2019s eyes, and went out of the room without a word. But at the door he stopped and then retraced his steps. \u201cO God,\u201d he said with tears in his eyes, \u201chow could you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cCount...\u201d said Tely\u00e1nin drawing nearer to him.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t touch me,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, drawing back. \u201cIf you need it, take the money,\u201d and he threw the purse to him and ran out of the inn.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThat same evening there was an animated discussion among the squadron\u2019s officers in Den\u00edsov\u2019s quarters.\n\n\u201cAnd I tell you, Rost\u00f3v, that you must apologize to the colonel!\u201d said a tall, grizzly-haired staff captain, with enormous mustaches and many wrinkles on his large features, to Rost\u00f3v who was crimson with excitement.\n\nThe staff captain, K\u00edrsten, had twice been reduced to the ranks for affairs of honor and had twice regained his commission.\n\n\u201cI will allow no one to call me a liar!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cHe told me I lied, and I told him he lied. And there it rests. He may keep me on duty every day, or may place me under arrest, but no one can make me apologize, because if he, as commander of this regiment, thinks it beneath his dignity to give me satisfaction, then...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just wait a moment, my dear fellow, and listen,\u201d interrupted the staff captain in his deep bass, calmly stroking his long mustache. \u201cYou tell the colonel in the presence of other officers that an officer has stolen...\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not to blame that the conversation began in the presence of other officers. Perhaps I ought not to have spoken before them, but I am not a diplomatist. That\u2019s why I joined the hussars, thinking that here one would not need finesse; and he tells me that I am lying\u2014so let him give me satisfaction...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all right. No one thinks you a coward, but that\u2019s not the point. Ask Den\u00edsov whether it is not out of the question for a cadet to demand satisfaction of his regimental commander?\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov sat gloomily biting his mustache and listening to the conversation, evidently with no wish to take part in it. He answered the staff captain\u2019s question by a disapproving shake of his head.\n\n\u201cYou speak to the colonel about this nasty business before other officers,\u201d continued the staff captain, \u201cand Bogd\u00e1nich\u201d (the colonel was called Bogd\u00e1nich) \u201cshuts you up.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did not shut me up, he said I was telling an untruth.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, have it so, and you talked a lot of nonsense to him and must apologize.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot on any account!\u201d exclaimed Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cI did not expect this of you,\u201d said the staff captain seriously and severely. \u201cYou don\u2019t wish to apologize, but, man, it\u2019s not only to him but to the whole regiment\u2014all of us\u2014you\u2019re to blame all round. The case is this: you ought to have thought the matter over and taken advice; but no, you go and blurt it all straight out before the officers. Now what was the colonel to do? Have the officer tried and disgrace the whole regiment? Disgrace the whole regiment because of one scoundrel? Is that how you look at it? We don\u2019t see it like that. And Bogd\u00e1nich was a brick: he told you you were saying what was not true. It\u2019s not pleasant, but what\u2019s to be done, my dear fellow? You landed yourself in it. And now, when one wants to smooth the thing over, some conceit prevents your apologizing, and you wish to make the whole affair public. You are offended at being put on duty a bit, but why not apologize to an old and honorable officer? Whatever Bogd\u00e1nich may be, anyway he is an honorable and brave old colonel! You\u2019re quick at taking offense, but you don\u2019t mind disgracing the whole regiment!\u201d The staff captain\u2019s voice began to tremble. \u201cYou have been in the regiment next to no time, my lad, you\u2019re here today and tomorrow you\u2019ll be appointed adjutant somewhere and can snap your fingers when it is said \u2018There are thieves among the P\u00e1vlograd officers!\u2019 But it\u2019s not all the same to us! Am I not right, Den\u00edsov? It\u2019s not the same!\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov remained silent and did not move, but occasionally looked with his glittering black eyes at Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cYou value your own pride and don\u2019t wish to apologize,\u201d continued the staff captain, \u201cbut we old fellows, who have grown up in and, God willing, are going to die in the regiment, we prize the honor of the regiment, and Bogd\u00e1nich knows it. Oh, we do prize it, old fellow! And all this is not right, it\u2019s not right! You may take offense or not but I always stick to mother truth. It\u2019s not right!\u201d\n\nAnd the staff captain rose and turned away from Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s twue, devil take it!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, jumping up. \u201cNow then, Wost\u00f3v, now then!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, growing red and pale alternately, looked first at one officer and then at the other.\n\n\u201cNo, gentlemen, no... you mustn\u2019t think... I quite understand. You\u2019re wrong to think that of me... I... for me... for the honor of the regiment I\u2019d... Ah well, I\u2019ll show that in action, and for me the honor of the flag... Well, never mind, it\u2019s true I\u2019m to blame, to blame all round. Well, what else do you want?...\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, that\u2019s right, Count!\u201d cried the staff captain, turning round and clapping Rost\u00f3v on the shoulder with his big hand.\n\n\u201cI tell you,\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, \u201che\u2019s a fine fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s better, Count,\u201d said the staff captain, beginning to address Rost\u00f3v by his title, as if in recognition of his confession. \u201cGo and apologize, your excellency. Yes, go!\u201d\n\n\u201cGentlemen, I\u2019ll do anything. No one shall hear a word from me,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v in an imploring voice, \u201cbut I can\u2019t apologize, by God I can\u2019t, do what you will! How can I go and apologize like a little boy asking forgiveness?\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov began to laugh.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019ll be worse for you. Bogd\u00e1nich is vindictive and you\u2019ll pay for your obstinacy,\u201d said K\u00edrsten.\n\n\u201cNo, on my word it\u2019s not obstinacy! I can\u2019t describe the feeling. I can\u2019t...\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, it\u2019s as you like,\u201d said the staff captain. \u201cAnd what has become of that scoundrel?\u201d he asked Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cHe has weported himself sick, he\u2019s to be stwuck off the list tomowwow,\u201d muttered Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cIt is an illness, there\u2019s no other way of explaining it,\u201d said the staff captain.\n\n\u201cIllness or not, he\u2019d better not cwoss my path. I\u2019d kill him!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov in a bloodthirsty tone.\n\nJust then Zherk\u00f3v entered the room.\n\n\u201cWhat brings you here?\u201d cried the officers turning to the newcomer.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re to go into action, gentlemen! Mack has surrendered with his whole army.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen him myself!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Saw the real Mack? With hands and feet?\u201d\n\n\u201cInto action! Into action! Bring him a bottle for such news! But how did you come here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been sent back to the regiment all on account of that devil, Mack. An Austrian general complained of me. I congratulated him on Mack\u2019s arrival... What\u2019s the matter, Rost\u00f3v? You look as if you\u2019d just come out of a hot bath.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my dear fellow, we\u2019re in such a stew here these last two days.\u201d\n\nThe regimental adjutant came in and confirmed the news brought by Zherk\u00f3v. They were under orders to advance next day.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going into action, gentlemen!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thank God! We\u2019ve been sitting here too long!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nKut\u00fazov fell back toward Vienna, destroying behind him the bridges over the rivers Inn (at Braunau) and Traun (near Linz). On October 23 the Russian troops were crossing the river Enns. At midday the Russian baggage train, the artillery, and columns of troops were defiling through the town of Enns on both sides of the bridge.\n\nIt was a warm, rainy, autumnal day. The wide expanse that opened out before the heights on which the Russian batteries stood guarding the bridge was at times veiled by a diaphanous curtain of slanting rain, and then, suddenly spread out in the sunlight, far-distant objects could be clearly seen glittering as though freshly varnished. Down below, the little town could be seen with its white, red-roofed houses, its cathedral, and its bridge, on both sides of which streamed jostling masses of Russian troops. At the bend of the Danube, vessels, an island, and a castle with a park surrounded by the waters of the confluence of the Enns and the Danube became visible, and the rocky left bank of the Danube covered with pine forests, with a mystic background of green treetops and bluish gorges. The turrets of a convent stood out beyond a wild virgin pine forest, and far away on the other side of the Enns the enemy\u2019s horse patrols could be discerned.\n\nAmong the field guns on the brow of the hill the general in command of the rearguard stood with a staff officer, scanning the country through his fieldglass. A little behind them Nesv\u00edtski, who had been sent to the rearguard by the commander in chief, was sitting on the trail of a gun carriage. A Cossack who accompanied him had handed him a knapsack and a flask, and Nesv\u00edtski was treating some officers to pies and real doppelk\u00fcmmel. The officers gladly gathered round him, some on their knees, some squatting Turkish fashion on the wet grass.\n\n\u201cYes, the Austrian prince who built that castle was no fool. It\u2019s a fine place! Why are you not eating anything, gentlemen?\u201d Nesv\u00edtski was saying.\n\n\u201cThank you very much, Prince,\u201d answered one of the officers, pleased to be talking to a staff officer of such importance. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely place! We passed close to the park and saw two deer... and what a splendid house!\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, Prince,\u201d said another, who would have dearly liked to take another pie but felt shy, and therefore pretended to be examining the countryside\u2014\u201cSee, our infantrymen have already got there. Look there in the meadow behind the village, three of them are dragging something. They\u2019ll ransack that castle,\u201d he remarked with evident approval.\n\n\u201cSo they will,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski. \u201cNo, but what I should like,\u201d added he, munching a pie in his moist-lipped handsome mouth, \u201cwould be to slip in over there.\u201d\n\nHe pointed with a smile to a turreted nunnery, and his eyes narrowed and gleamed.\n\n\u201cThat would be fine, gentlemen!\u201d\n\nThe officers laughed.\n\n\u201cJust to flutter the nuns a bit. They say there are Italian girls among them. On my word I\u2019d give five years of my life for it!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey must be feeling dull, too,\u201d said one of the bolder officers, laughing.\n\nMeanwhile the staff officer standing in front pointed out something to the general, who looked through his field glass.\n\n\u201cYes, so it is, so it is,\u201d said the general angrily, lowering the field glass and shrugging his shoulders, \u201cso it is! They\u2019ll be fired on at the crossing. And why are they dawdling there?\u201d\n\nOn the opposite side the enemy could be seen by the naked eye, and from their battery a milk-white cloud arose. Then came the distant report of a shot, and our troops could be seen hurrying to the crossing.\n\nNesv\u00edtski rose, puffing, and went up to the general, smiling.\n\n\u201cWould not your excellency like a little refreshment?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bad business,\u201d said the general without answering him, \u201cour men have been wasting time.\u201d\n\n\u201cHadn\u2019t I better ride over, your excellency?\u201d asked Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cYes, please do,\u201d answered the general, and he repeated the order that had already once been given in detail: \u201cand tell the hussars that they are to cross last and to fire the bridge as I ordered; and the inflammable material on the bridge must be reinspected.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery good,\u201d answered Nesv\u00edtski.\n\nHe called the Cossack with his horse, told him to put away the knapsack and flask, and swung his heavy person easily into the saddle.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll really call in on the nuns,\u201d he said to the officers who watched him smilingly, and he rode off by the winding path down the hill.\n\n\u201cNow then, let\u2019s see how far it will carry, Captain. Just try!\u201d said the general, turning to an artillery officer. \u201cHave a little fun to pass the time.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrew, to your guns!\u201d commanded the officer.\n\nIn a moment the men came running gaily from their campfires and began loading.\n\n\u201cOne!\u201d came the command.\n\nNumber one jumped briskly aside. The gun rang out with a deafening metallic roar, and a whistling grenade flew above the heads of our troops below the hill and fell far short of the enemy, a little smoke showing the spot where it burst.\n\nThe faces of officers and men brightened up at the sound. Everyone got up and began watching the movements of our troops below, as plainly visible as if but a stone\u2019s throw away, and the movements of the approaching enemy farther off. At the same instant the sun came fully out from behind the clouds, and the clear sound of the solitary shot and the brilliance of the bright sunshine merged in a single joyous and spirited impression.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTwo of the enemy\u2019s shots had already flown across the bridge, where there was a crush. Halfway across stood Prince Nesv\u00edtski, who had alighted from his horse and whose big body was jammed against the railings. He looked back laughing to the Cossack who stood a few steps behind him holding two horses by their bridles. Each time Prince Nesv\u00edtski tried to move on, soldiers and carts pushed him back again and pressed him against the railings, and all he could do was to smile.\n\n\u201cWhat a fine fellow you are, friend!\u201d said the Cossack to a convoy soldier with a wagon, who was pressing onto the infantrymen who were crowded together close to his wheels and his horses. \u201cWhat a fellow! You can\u2019t wait a moment! Don\u2019t you see the general wants to pass?\u201d\n\nBut the convoyman took no notice of the word \u201cgeneral\u201d and shouted at the soldiers who were blocking his way. \u201cHi there, boys! Keep to the left! Wait a bit.\u201d But the soldiers, crowded together shoulder to shoulder, their bayonets interlocking, moved over the bridge in a dense mass. Looking down over the rails Prince Nesv\u00edtski saw the rapid, noisy little waves of the Enns, which rippling and eddying round the piles of the bridge chased each other along. Looking on the bridge he saw equally uniform living waves of soldiers, shoulder straps, covered shakos, knapsacks, bayonets, long muskets, and, under the shakos, faces with broad cheekbones, sunken cheeks, and listless tired expressions, and feet that moved through the sticky mud that covered the planks of the bridge. Sometimes through the monotonous waves of men, like a fleck of white foam on the waves of the Enns, an officer, in a cloak and with a type of face different from that of the men, squeezed his way along; sometimes like a chip of wood whirling in the river, an hussar on foot, an orderly, or a townsman was carried through the waves of infantry; and sometimes like a log floating down the river, an officers\u2019 or company\u2019s baggage wagon, piled high, leather covered, and hemmed in on all sides, moved across the bridge.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as if a dam had burst,\u201d said the Cossack hopelessly. \u201cAre there many more of you to come?\u201d\n\n\u201cA million all but one!\u201d replied a waggish soldier in a torn coat, with a wink, and passed on followed by another, an old man.\n\n\u201cIf he\u201d (he meant the enemy) \u201cbegins popping at the bridge now,\u201d said the old soldier dismally to a comrade, \u201cyou\u2019ll forget to scratch yourself.\u201d\n\nThat soldier passed on, and after him came another sitting on a cart.\n\n\u201cWhere the devil have the leg bands been shoved to?\u201d said an orderly, running behind the cart and fumbling in the back of it.\n\nAnd he also passed on with the wagon. Then came some merry soldiers who had evidently been drinking.\n\n\u201cAnd then, old fellow, he gives him one in the teeth with the butt end of his gun...\u201d a soldier whose greatcoat was well tucked up said gaily, with a wide swing of his arm.\n\n\u201cYes, the ham was just delicious...\u201d answered another with a loud laugh. And they, too, passed on, so that Nesv\u00edtski did not learn who had been struck on the teeth, or what the ham had to do with it.\n\n\u201cBah! How they scurry. He just sends a ball and they think they\u2019ll all be killed,\u201d a sergeant was saying angrily and reproachfully.\n\n\u201cAs it flies past me, Daddy, the ball I mean,\u201d said a young soldier with an enormous mouth, hardly refraining from laughing, \u201cI felt like dying of fright. I did, \u2018pon my word, I got that frightened!\u201d said he, as if bragging of having been frightened.\n\nThat one also passed. Then followed a cart unlike any that had gone before. It was a German cart with a pair of horses led by a German, and seemed loaded with a whole houseful of effects. A fine brindled cow with a large udder was attached to the cart behind. A woman with an unweaned baby, an old woman, and a healthy German girl with bright red cheeks were sitting on some feather beds. Evidently these fugitives were allowed to pass by special permission. The eyes of all the soldiers turned toward the women, and while the vehicle was passing at foot pace all the soldiers\u2019 remarks related to the two young ones. Every face bore almost the same smile, expressing unseemly thoughts about the women.\n\n\u201cJust see, the German sausage is making tracks, too!\u201d\n\n\u201cSell me the missis,\u201d said another soldier, addressing the German, who, angry and frightened, strode energetically along with downcast eyes.\n\n\u201cSee how smart she\u2019s made herself! Oh, the devils!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, Fed\u00f3tov, you should be quartered on them!\u201d\n\n\u201cI have seen as much before now, mate!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d asked an infantry officer who was eating an apple, also half smiling as he looked at the handsome girl.\n\nThe German closed his eyes, signifying that he did not understand.\n\n\u201cTake it if you like,\u201d said the officer, giving the girl an apple.\n\nThe girl smiled and took it. Nesv\u00edtski like the rest of the men on the bridge did not take his eyes off the women till they had passed. When they had gone by, the same stream of soldiers followed, with the same kind of talk, and at last all stopped. As often happens, the horses of a convoy wagon became restive at the end of the bridge, and the whole crowd had to wait.\n\n\u201cAnd why are they stopping? There\u2019s no proper order!\u201d said the soldiers. \u201cWhere are you shoving to? Devil take you! Can\u2019t you wait? It\u2019ll be worse if he fires the bridge. See, here\u2019s an officer jammed in too\u201d\u2014different voices were saying in the crowd, as the men looked at one another, and all pressed toward the exit from the bridge.\n\nLooking down at the waters of the Enns under the bridge, Nesv\u00edtski suddenly heard a sound new to him, of something swiftly approaching... something big, that splashed into the water.\n\n\u201cJust see where it carries to!\u201d a soldier near by said sternly, looking round at the sound.\n\n\u201cEncouraging us to get along quicker,\u201d said another uneasily.\n\nThe crowd moved on again. Nesv\u00edtski realized that it was a cannon ball.\n\n\u201cHey, Cossack, my horse!\u201d he said. \u201cNow, then, you there! get out of the way! Make way!\u201d\n\nWith great difficulty he managed to get to his horse, and shouting continually he moved on. The soldiers squeezed themselves to make way for him, but again pressed on him so that they jammed his leg, and those nearest him were not to blame for they were themselves pressed still harder from behind.\n\n\u201cNesv\u00edtski, Nesv\u00edtski! you numskull!\u201d came a hoarse voice from behind him.\n\nNesv\u00edtski looked round and saw, some fifteen paces away but separated by the living mass of moving infantry, V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov, red and shaggy, with his cap on the back of his black head and a cloak hanging jauntily over his shoulder.\n\n\u201cTell these devils, these fiends, to let me pass!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov evidently in a fit of rage, his coal-black eyes with their bloodshot whites glittering and rolling as he waved his sheathed saber in a small bare hand as red as his face.\n\n\u201cAh, V\u00e1ska!\u201d joyfully replied Nesv\u00edtski. \u201cWhat\u2019s up with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe squadwon can\u2019t pass,\u201d shouted V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov, showing his white teeth fiercely and spurring his black thoroughbred Arab, which twitched its ears as the bayonets touched it, and snorted, spurting white foam from his bit, tramping the planks of the bridge with his hoofs, and apparently ready to jump over the railings had his rider let him. \u201cWhat is this? They\u2019re like sheep! Just like sheep! Out of the way!... Let us pass!... Stop there, you devil with the cart! I\u2019ll hack you with my saber!\u201d he shouted, actually drawing his saber from its scabbard and flourishing it.\n\nThe soldiers crowded against one another with terrified faces, and Den\u00edsov joined Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s it you\u2019re not drunk today?\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski when the other had ridden up to him.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even give one time to dwink!\u201d answered V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov. \u201cThey keep dwagging the wegiment to and fwo all day. If they mean to fight, let\u2019s fight. But the devil knows what this is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a dandy you are today!\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski, looking at Den\u00edsov\u2019s new cloak and saddlecloth.\n\nDen\u00edsov smiled, took out of his sabretache a handkerchief that diffused a smell of perfume, and put it to Nesv\u00edtski\u2019s nose.\n\n\u201cOf course. I\u2019m going into action! I\u2019ve shaved, bwushed my teeth, and scented myself.\u201d\n\nThe imposing figure of Nesv\u00edtski followed by his Cossack, and the determination of Den\u00edsov who flourished his sword and shouted frantically, had such an effect that they managed to squeeze through to the farther side of the bridge and stopped the infantry. Beside the bridge Nesv\u00edtski found the colonel to whom he had to deliver the order, and having done this he rode back.\n\nHaving cleared the way Den\u00edsov stopped at the end of the bridge. Carelessly holding in his stallion that was neighing and pawing the ground, eager to rejoin its fellows, he watched his squadron draw nearer. Then the clang of hoofs, as of several horses galloping, resounded on the planks of the bridge, and the squadron, officers in front and men four abreast, spread across the bridge and began to emerge on his side of it.\n\nThe infantry who had been stopped crowded near the bridge in the trampled mud and gazed with that particular feeling of ill-will, estrangement, and ridicule with which troops of different arms usually encounter one another at the clean, smart hussars who moved past them in regular order.\n\n\u201cSmart lads! Only fit for a fair!\u201d said one.\n\n\u201cWhat good are they? They\u2019re led about just for show!\u201d remarked another.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t kick up the dust, you infantry!\u201d jested an hussar whose prancing horse had splashed mud over some foot soldiers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d like to put you on a two days\u2019 march with a knapsack! Your fine cords would soon get a bit rubbed,\u201d said an infantryman, wiping the mud off his face with his sleeve. \u201cPerched up there, you\u2019re more like a bird than a man.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now, Z\u00edkin, they ought to put you on a horse. You\u2019d look fine,\u201d said a corporal, chaffing a thin little soldier who bent under the weight of his knapsack.\n\n\u201cTake a stick between your legs, that\u2019ll suit you for a horse!\u201d the hussar shouted back.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe last of the infantry hurriedly crossed the bridge, squeezing together as they approached it as if passing through a funnel. At last the baggage wagons had all crossed, the crush was less, and the last battalion came onto the bridge. Only Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron of hussars remained on the farther side of the bridge facing the enemy, who could be seen from the hill on the opposite bank but was not yet visible from the bridge, for the horizon as seen from the valley through which the river flowed was formed by the rising ground only half a mile away. At the foot of the hill lay wasteland over which a few groups of our Cossack scouts were moving. Suddenly on the road at the top of the high ground, artillery and troops in blue uniform were seen. These were the French. A group of Cossack scouts retired down the hill at a trot. All the officers and men of Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron, though they tried to talk of other things and to look in other directions, thought only of what was there on the hilltop, and kept constantly looking at the patches appearing on the skyline, which they knew to be the enemy\u2019s troops. The weather had cleared again since noon and the sun was descending brightly upon the Danube and the dark hills around it. It was calm, and at intervals the bugle calls and the shouts of the enemy could be heard from the hill. There was no one now between the squadron and the enemy except a few scattered skirmishers. An empty space of some seven hundred yards was all that separated them. The enemy ceased firing, and that stern, threatening, inaccessible, and intangible line which separates two hostile armies was all the more clearly felt.\n\n\u201cOne step beyond that boundary line which resembles the line dividing the living from the dead lies uncertainty, suffering, and death. And what is there? Who is there?\u2014there beyond that field, that tree, that roof lit up by the sun? No one knows, but one wants to know. You fear and yet long to cross that line, and know that sooner or later it must be crossed and you will have to find out what is there, just as you will inevitably have to learn what lies the other side of death. But you are strong, healthy, cheerful, and excited, and are surrounded by other such excitedly animated and healthy men.\u201d So thinks, or at any rate feels, anyone who comes in sight of the enemy, and that feeling gives a particular glamour and glad keenness of impression to everything that takes place at such moments.\n\nOn the high ground where the enemy was, the smoke of a cannon rose, and a ball flew whistling over the heads of the hussar squadron. The officers who had been standing together rode off to their places. The hussars began carefully aligning their horses. Silence fell on the whole squadron. All were looking at the enemy in front and at the squadron commander, awaiting the word of command. A second and a third cannon ball flew past. Evidently they were firing at the hussars, but the balls with rapid rhythmic whistle flew over the heads of the horsemen and fell somewhere beyond them. The hussars did not look round, but at the sound of each shot, as at the word of command, the whole squadron with its rows of faces so alike yet so different, holding its breath while the ball flew past, rose in the stirrups and sank back again. The soldiers without turning their heads glanced at one another, curious to see their comrades\u2019 impression. Every face, from Den\u00edsov\u2019s to that of the bugler, showed one common expression of conflict, irritation, and excitement, around chin and mouth. The quartermaster frowned, looking at the soldiers as if threatening to punish them. Cadet Mir\u00f3nov ducked every time a ball flew past. Rost\u00f3v on the left flank, mounted on his Rook\u2014a handsome horse despite its game leg\u2014had the happy air of a schoolboy called up before a large audience for an examination in which he feels sure he will distinguish himself. He was glancing at everyone with a clear, bright expression, as if asking them to notice how calmly he sat under fire. But despite himself, on his face too that same indication of something new and stern showed round the mouth.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that curtseying there? Cadet Miw\u00f3nov! That\u2019s not wight! Look at me,\u201d cried Den\u00edsov who, unable to keep still on one spot, kept turning his horse in front of the squadron.\n\nThe black, hairy, snub-nosed face of V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov, and his whole short sturdy figure with the sinewy hairy hand and stumpy fingers in which he held the hilt of his naked saber, looked just as it usually did, especially toward evening when he had emptied his second bottle; he was only redder than usual. With his shaggy head thrown back like birds when they drink, pressing his spurs mercilessly into the sides of his good horse, Bedouin, and sitting as though falling backwards in the saddle, he galloped to the other flank of the squadron and shouted in a hoarse voice to the men to look to their pistols. He rode up to K\u00edrsten. The staff captain on his broad-backed, steady mare came at a walk to meet him. His face with its long mustache was serious as always, only his eyes were brighter than usual.\n\n\u201cWell, what about it?\u201d said he to Den\u00edsov. \u201cIt won\u2019t come to a fight. You\u2019ll see\u2014we shall retire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe devil only knows what they\u2019re about!\u201d muttered Den\u00edsov. \u201cAh, Wost\u00f3v,\u201d he cried noticing the cadet\u2019s bright face, \u201cyou\u2019ve got it at last.\u201d\n\nAnd he smiled approvingly, evidently pleased with the cadet. Rost\u00f3v felt perfectly happy. Just then the commander appeared on the bridge. Den\u00edsov galloped up to him.\n\n\u201cYour excellency! Let us attack them! I\u2019ll dwive them off.\u201d\n\n\u201cAttack indeed!\u201d said the colonel in a bored voice, puckering up his face as if driving off a troublesome fly. \u201cAnd why are you stopping here? Don\u2019t you see the skirmishers are retreating? Lead the squadron back.\u201d\n\nThe squadron crossed the bridge and drew out of range of fire without having lost a single man. The second squadron that had been in the front line followed them across and the last Cossacks quitted the farther side of the river.\n\nThe two P\u00e1vlograd squadrons, having crossed the bridge, retired up the hill one after the other. Their colonel, Karl Bogd\u00e1nich Schubert, came up to Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron and rode at a footpace not far from Rost\u00f3v, without taking any notice of him although they were now meeting for the first time since their encounter concerning Tely\u00e1nin. Rost\u00f3v, feeling that he was at the front and in the power of a man toward whom he now admitted that he had been to blame, did not lift his eyes from the colonel\u2019s athletic back, his nape covered with light hair, and his red neck. It seemed to Rost\u00f3v that Bogd\u00e1nich was only pretending not to notice him, and that his whole aim now was to test the cadet\u2019s courage, so he drew himself up and looked around him merrily; then it seemed to him that Bogd\u00e1nich rode so near in order to show him his courage. Next he thought that his enemy would send the squadron on a desperate attack just to punish him\u2014Rost\u00f3v. Then he imagined how, after the attack, Bogd\u00e1nich would come up to him as he lay wounded and would magnanimously extend the hand of reconciliation.\n\nThe high-shouldered figure of Zherk\u00f3v, familiar to the P\u00e1vlograds as he had but recently left their regiment, rode up to the colonel. After his dismissal from headquarters Zherk\u00f3v had not remained in the regiment, saying he was not such a fool as to slave at the front when he could get more rewards by doing nothing on the staff, and had succeeded in attaching himself as an orderly officer to Prince Bagrati\u00f3n. He now came to his former chief with an order from the commander of the rear guard.\n\n\u201cColonel,\u201d he said, addressing Rost\u00f3v\u2019s enemy with an air of gloomy gravity and glancing round at his comrades, \u201cthere is an order to stop and fire the bridge.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn order to who?\u201d asked the colonel morosely.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t myself know \u2018to who,\u2019\u201d replied the cornet in a serious tone, \u201cbut the prince told me to \u2018go and tell the colonel that the hussars must return quickly and fire the bridge.\u2019\u201d\n\nZherk\u00f3v was followed by an officer of the suite who rode up to the colonel of hussars with the same order. After him the stout Nesv\u00edtski came galloping up on a Cossack horse that could scarcely carry his weight.\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s this, Colonel?\u201d he shouted as he approached. \u201cI told you to fire the bridge, and now someone has gone and blundered; they are all beside themselves over there and one can\u2019t make anything out.\u201d\n\nThe colonel deliberately stopped the regiment and turned to Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cYou spoke to me of inflammable material,\u201d said he, \u201cbut you said nothing about firing it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, my dear sir,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski as he drew up, taking off his cap and smoothing his hair wet with perspiration with his plump hand, \u201cwasn\u2019t I telling you to fire the bridge, when inflammable material had been put in position?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not your \u2018dear sir,\u2019 Mr. Staff Officer, and you did not tell me to burn the bridge! I know the service, and it is my habit orders strictly to obey. You said the bridge would be burned, but who would burn it, I could not know by the holy spirit!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s always the way!\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski with a wave of the hand. \u201cHow did you get here?\u201d said he, turning to Zherk\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cOn the same business. But you are damp! Let me wring you out!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were saying, Mr. Staff Officer...\u201d continued the colonel in an offended tone.\n\n\u201cColonel,\u201d interrupted the officer of the suite, \u201cYou must be quick or the enemy will bring up his guns to use grapeshot.\u201d\n\nThe colonel looked silently at the officer of the suite, at the stout staff officer, and at Zherk\u00f3v, and he frowned.\n\n\u201cI will the bridge fire,\u201d he said in a solemn tone as if to announce that in spite of all the unpleasantness he had to endure he would still do the right thing.\n\nStriking his horse with his long muscular legs as if it were to blame for everything, the colonel moved forward and ordered the second squadron, that in which Rost\u00f3v was serving under Den\u00edsov, to return to the bridge.\n\n\u201cThere, it\u2019s just as I thought,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v to himself. \u201cHe wishes to test me!\u201d His heart contracted and the blood rushed to his face. \u201cLet him see whether I am a coward!\u201d he thought.\n\nAgain on all the bright faces of the squadron the serious expression appeared that they had worn when under fire. Rost\u00f3v watched his enemy, the colonel, closely\u2014to find in his face confirmation of his own conjecture, but the colonel did not once glance at Rost\u00f3v, and looked as he always did when at the front, solemn and stern. Then came the word of command.\n\n\u201cLook sharp! Look sharp!\u201d several voices repeated around him.\n\nTheir sabers catching in the bridles and their spurs jingling, the hussars hastily dismounted, not knowing what they were to do. The men were crossing themselves. Rost\u00f3v no longer looked at the colonel, he had no time. He was afraid of falling behind the hussars, so much afraid that his heart stood still. His hand trembled as he gave his horse into an orderly\u2019s charge, and he felt the blood rush to his heart with a thud. Den\u00edsov rode past him, leaning back and shouting something. Rost\u00f3v saw nothing but the hussars running all around him, their spurs catching and their sabers clattering.\n\n\u201cStretchers!\u201d shouted someone behind him.\n\nRost\u00f3v did not think what this call for stretchers meant; he ran on, trying only to be ahead of the others; but just at the bridge, not looking at the ground, he came on some sticky, trodden mud, stumbled, and fell on his hands. The others outstripped him.\n\n\u201cAt boss zides, Captain,\u201d he heard the voice of the colonel, who, having ridden ahead, had pulled up his horse near the bridge, with a triumphant, cheerful face.\n\nRost\u00f3v wiping his muddy hands on his breeches looked at his enemy and was about to run on, thinking that the farther he went to the front the better. But Bogd\u00e1nich, without looking at or recognizing Rost\u00f3v, shouted to him:\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that running on the middle of the bridge? To the right! Come back, Cadet!\u201d he cried angrily; and turning to Den\u00edsov, who, showing off his courage, had ridden on to the planks of the bridge:\n\n\u201cWhy run risks, Captain? You should dismount,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, every bullet has its billet,\u201d answered V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov, turning in his saddle.\n\n\nMeanwhile Nesv\u00edtski, Zherk\u00f3v, and the officer of the suite were standing together out of range of the shots, watching, now the small group of men with yellow shakos, dark-green jackets braided with cord, and blue riding breeches, who were swarming near the bridge, and then at what was approaching in the distance from the opposite side\u2014the blue uniforms and groups with horses, easily recognizable as artillery.\n\n\u201cWill they burn the bridge or not? Who\u2019ll get there first? Will they get there and fire the bridge or will the French get within grapeshot range and wipe them out?\u201d These were the questions each man of the troops on the high ground above the bridge involuntarily asked himself with a sinking heart\u2014watching the bridge and the hussars in the bright evening light and the blue tunics advancing from the other side with their bayonets and guns.\n\n\u201cUgh. The hussars will get it hot!\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski; \u201cthey are within grapeshot range now.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe shouldn\u2019t have taken so many men,\u201d said the officer of the suite.\n\n\u201cTrue enough,\u201d answered Nesv\u00edtski; \u201ctwo smart fellows could have done the job just as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, your excellency,\u201d put in Zherk\u00f3v, his eyes fixed on the hussars, but still with that na\u00efve air that made it impossible to know whether he was speaking in jest or in earnest. \u201cAh, your excellency! How you look at things! Send two men? And who then would give us the Vlad\u00edmir medal and ribbon? But now, even if they do get peppered, the squadron may be recommended for honors and he may get a ribbon. Our Bogd\u00e1nich knows how things are done.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now!\u201d said the officer of the suite, \u201cthat\u2019s grapeshot.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to the French guns, the limbers of which were being detached and hurriedly removed.\n\nOn the French side, amid the groups with cannon, a cloud of smoke appeared, then a second and a third almost simultaneously, and at the moment when the first report was heard a fourth was seen. Then two reports one after another, and a third.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh!\u201d groaned Nesv\u00edtski as if in fierce pain, seizing the officer of the suite by the arm. \u201cLook! A man has fallen! Fallen, fallen!\u201d\n\n\u201cTwo, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were Tsar I would never go to war,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski, turning away.\n\nThe French guns were hastily reloaded. The infantry in their blue uniforms advanced toward the bridge at a run. Smoke appeared again but at irregular intervals, and grapeshot cracked and rattled onto the bridge. But this time Nesv\u00edtski could not see what was happening there, as a dense cloud of smoke arose from it. The hussars had succeeded in setting it on fire and the French batteries were now firing at them, no longer to hinder them but because the guns were trained and there was someone to fire at.\n\nThe French had time to fire three rounds of grapeshot before the hussars got back to their horses. Two were misdirected and the shot went too high, but the last round fell in the midst of a group of hussars and knocked three of them over.\n\nRost\u00f3v, absorbed by his relations with Bogd\u00e1nich, had paused on the bridge not knowing what to do. There was no one to hew down (as he had always imagined battles to himself), nor could he help to fire the bridge because he had not brought any burning straw with him like the other soldiers. He stood looking about him, when suddenly he heard a rattle on the bridge as if nuts were being spilt, and the hussar nearest to him fell against the rails with a groan. Rost\u00f3v ran up to him with the others. Again someone shouted, \u201cStretchers!\u201d Four men seized the hussar and began lifting him.\n\n\u201cOooh! For Christ\u2019s sake let me alone!\u201d cried the wounded man, but still he was lifted and laid on the stretcher.\n\nNicholas Rost\u00f3v turned away and, as if searching for something, gazed into the distance, at the waters of the Danube, at the sky, and at the sun. How beautiful the sky looked; how blue, how calm, and how deep! How bright and glorious was the setting sun! With what soft glitter the waters of the distant Danube shone. And fairer still were the faraway blue mountains beyond the river, the nunnery, the mysterious gorges, and the pine forests veiled in the mist of their summits... There was peace and happiness... \u201cI should wish for nothing else, nothing, if only I were there,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIn myself alone and in that sunshine there is so much happiness; but here... groans, suffering, fear, and this uncertainty and hurry... There\u2014they are shouting again, and again are all running back somewhere, and I shall run with them, and it, death, is here above me and around... Another instant and I shall never again see the sun, this water, that gorge!...\u201d\n\nAt that instant the sun began to hide behind the clouds, and other stretchers came into view before Rost\u00f3v. And the fear of death and of the stretchers, and love of the sun and of life, all merged into one feeling of sickening agitation.\n\n\u201cO Lord God! Thou who art in that heaven, save, forgive, and protect me!\u201d Rost\u00f3v whispered.\n\nThe hussars ran back to the men who held their horses; their voices sounded louder and calmer, the stretchers disappeared from sight.\n\n\u201cWell, fwiend? So you\u2019ve smelt powdah!\u201d shouted V\u00e1ska Den\u00edsov just above his ear.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all over; but I am a coward\u2014yes, a coward!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, and sighing deeply he took Rook, his horse, which stood resting one foot, from the orderly and began to mount.\n\n\u201cWas that grapeshot?\u201d he asked Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cYes and no mistake!\u201d cried Den\u00edsov. \u201cYou worked like wegular bwicks and it\u2019s nasty work! An attack\u2019s pleasant work! Hacking away at the dogs! But this sort of thing is the very devil, with them shooting at you like a target.\u201d\n\nAnd Den\u00edsov rode up to a group that had stopped near Rost\u00f3v, composed of the colonel, Nesv\u00edtski, Zherk\u00f3v, and the officer from the suite.\n\n\u201cWell, it seems that no one has noticed,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. And this was true. No one had taken any notice, for everyone knew the sensation which the cadet under fire for the first time had experienced.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s something for you to report,\u201d said Zherk\u00f3v. \u201cSee if I don\u2019t get promoted to a sublieutenancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cInform the prince that I the bridge fired!\u201d said the colonel triumphantly and gaily.\n\n\u201cAnd if he asks about the losses?\u201d\n\n\u201cA trifle,\u201d said the colonel in his bass voice: \u201ctwo hussars wounded, and one knocked out,\u201d he added, unable to restrain a happy smile, and pronouncing the phrase \u201cknocked out\u201d with ringing distinctness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPursued by the French army of a hundred thousand men under the command of Bonaparte, encountering a population that was unfriendly to it, losing confidence in its allies, suffering from shortness of supplies, and compelled to act under conditions of war unlike anything that had been foreseen, the Russian army of thirty-five thousand men commanded by Kut\u00fazov was hurriedly retreating along the Danube, stopping where overtaken by the enemy and fighting rearguard actions only as far as necessary to enable it to retreat without losing its heavy equipment. There had been actions at Lambach, Amstetten, and Melk; but despite the courage and endurance\u2014acknowledged even by the enemy\u2014with which the Russians fought, the only consequence of these actions was a yet more rapid retreat. Austrian troops that had escaped capture at Ulm and had joined Kut\u00fazov at Braunau now separated from the Russian army, and Kut\u00fazov was left with only his own weak and exhausted forces. The defense of Vienna was no longer to be thought of. Instead of an offensive, the plan of which, carefully prepared in accord with the modern science of strategics, had been handed to Kut\u00fazov when he was in Vienna by the Austrian Hofkriegsrath, the sole and almost unattainable aim remaining for him was to effect a junction with the forces that were advancing from Russia, without losing his army as Mack had done at Ulm.\n\nOn the twenty-eighth of October Kut\u00fazov with his army crossed to the left bank of the Danube and took up a position for the first time with the river between himself and the main body of the French. On the thirtieth he attacked Mortier\u2019s division, which was on the left bank, and broke it up. In this action for the first time trophies were taken: banners, cannon, and two enemy generals. For the first time, after a fortnight\u2019s retreat, the Russian troops had halted and after a fight had not only held the field but had repulsed the French. Though the troops were ill-clad, exhausted, and had lost a third of their number in killed, wounded, sick, and stragglers; though a number of sick and wounded had been abandoned on the other side of the Danube with a letter in which Kut\u00fazov entrusted them to the humanity of the enemy; and though the big hospitals and the houses in Krems converted into military hospitals could no longer accommodate all the sick and wounded, yet the stand made at Krems and the victory over Mortier raised the spirits of the army considerably. Throughout the whole army and at headquarters most joyful though erroneous rumors were rife of the imaginary approach of columns from Russia, of some victory gained by the Austrians, and of the retreat of the frightened Bonaparte.\n\nPrince Andrew during the battle had been in attendance on the Austrian General Schmidt, who was killed in the action. His horse had been wounded under him and his own arm slightly grazed by a bullet. As a mark of the commander in chief\u2019s special favor he was sent with the news of this victory to the Austrian court, now no longer at Vienna (which was threatened by the French) but at Br\u00fcnn. Despite his apparently delicate build Prince Andrew could endure physical fatigue far better than many very muscular men, and on the night of the battle, having arrived at Krems excited but not weary, with dispatches from Dokht\u00farov to Kut\u00fazov, he was sent immediately with a special dispatch to Br\u00fcnn. To be so sent meant not only a reward but an important step toward promotion.\n\nThe night was dark but starry, the road showed black in the snow that had fallen the previous day\u2014the day of the battle. Reviewing his impressions of the recent battle, picturing pleasantly to himself the impression his news of a victory would create, or recalling the send-off given him by the commander in chief and his fellow officers, Prince Andrew was galloping along in a post chaise enjoying the feelings of a man who has at length begun to attain a long-desired happiness. As soon as he closed his eyes his ears seemed filled with the rattle of the wheels and the sensation of victory. Then he began to imagine that the Russians were running away and that he himself was killed, but he quickly roused himself with a feeling of joy, as if learning afresh that this was not so but that on the contrary the French had run away. He again recalled all the details of the victory and his own calm courage during the battle, and feeling reassured he dozed off.... The dark starry night was followed by a bright cheerful morning. The snow was thawing in the sunshine, the horses galloped quickly, and on both sides of the road were forests of different kinds, fields, and villages.\n\nAt one of the post stations he overtook a convoy of Russian wounded. The Russian officer in charge of the transport lolled back in the front cart, shouting and scolding a soldier with coarse abuse. In each of the long German carts six or more pale, dirty, bandaged men were being jolted over the stony road. Some of them were talking (he heard Russian words), others were eating bread; the more severely wounded looked silently, with the languid interest of sick children, at the envoy hurrying past them.\n\nPrince Andrew told his driver to stop, and asked a soldier in what action they had been wounded. \u201cDay before yesterday, on the Danube,\u201d answered the soldier. Prince Andrew took out his purse and gave the soldier three gold pieces.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for them all,\u201d he said to the officer who came up.\n\n\u201cGet well soon, lads!\u201d he continued, turning to the soldiers. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty to do still.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat news, sir?\u201d asked the officer, evidently anxious to start a conversation.\n\n\u201cGood news!... Go on!\u201d he shouted to the driver, and they galloped on.\n\nIt was already quite dark when Prince Andrew rattled over the paved streets of Br\u00fcnn and found himself surrounded by high buildings, the lights of shops, houses, and street lamps, fine carriages, and all that atmosphere of a large and active town which is always so attractive to a soldier after camp life. Despite his rapid journey and sleepless night, Prince Andrew when he drove up to the palace felt even more vigorous and alert than he had done the day before. Only his eyes gleamed feverishly and his thoughts followed one another with extraordinary clearness and rapidity. He again vividly recalled the details of the battle, no longer dim, but definite and in the concise form in which he imagined himself stating them to the Emperor Francis. He vividly imagined the casual questions that might be put to him and the answers he would give. He expected to be at once presented to the Emperor. At the chief entrance to the palace, however, an official came running out to meet him, and learning that he was a special messenger led him to another entrance.\n\n\u201cTo the right from the corridor, Euer Hochgeboren! There you will find the adjutant on duty,\u201d said the official. \u201cHe will conduct you to the Minister of War.\u201d\n\nThe adjutant on duty, meeting Prince Andrew, asked him to wait, and went in to the Minister of War. Five minutes later he returned and bowing with particular courtesy ushered Prince Andrew before him along a corridor to the cabinet where the Minister of War was at work. The adjutant by his elaborate courtesy appeared to wish to ward off any attempt at familiarity on the part of the Russian messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s joyous feeling was considerably weakened as he approached the door of the minister\u2019s room. He felt offended, and without his noticing it the feeling of offense immediately turned into one of disdain which was quite uncalled for. His fertile mind instantly suggested to him a point of view which gave him a right to despise the adjutant and the minister. \u201cAway from the smell of powder, they probably think it easy to gain victories!\u201d he thought. His eyes narrowed disdainfully, he entered the room of the Minister of War with peculiarly deliberate steps. This feeling of disdain was heightened when he saw the minister seated at a large table reading some papers and making pencil notes on them, and for the first two or three minutes taking no notice of his arrival. A wax candle stood at each side of the minister\u2019s bent bald head with its gray temples. He went on reading to the end, without raising his eyes at the opening of the door and the sound of footsteps.\n\n\u201cTake this and deliver it,\u201d said he to his adjutant, handing him the papers and still taking no notice of the special messenger.\n\nPrince Andrew felt that either the actions of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s army interested the Minister of War less than any of the other matters he was concerned with, or he wanted to give the Russian special messenger that impression. \u201cBut that is a matter of perfect indifference to me,\u201d he thought. The minister drew the remaining papers together, arranged them evenly, and then raised his head. He had an intellectual and distinctive head, but the instant he turned to Prince Andrew the firm, intelligent expression on his face changed in a way evidently deliberate and habitual to him. His face took on the stupid artificial smile (which does not even attempt to hide its artificiality) of a man who is continually receiving many petitioners one after another.\n\n\u201cFrom General Field Marshal Kut\u00fazov?\u201d he asked. \u201cI hope it is good news? There has been an encounter with Mortier? A victory? It was high time!\u201d\n\nHe took the dispatch which was addressed to him and began to read it with a mournful expression.\n\n\u201cOh, my God! My God! Schmidt!\u201d he exclaimed in German. \u201cWhat a calamity! What a calamity!\u201d\n\nHaving glanced through the dispatch he laid it on the table and looked at Prince Andrew, evidently considering something.\n\n\u201cAh what a calamity! You say the affair was decisive? But Mortier is not captured.\u201d Again he pondered. \u201cI am very glad you have brought good news, though Schmidt\u2019s death is a heavy price to pay for the victory. His Majesty will no doubt wish to see you, but not today. I thank you! You must have a rest. Be at the levee tomorrow after the parade. However, I will let you know.\u201d\n\nThe stupid smile, which had left his face while he was speaking, reappeared.\n\n\u201cAu revoir! Thank you very much. His Majesty will probably desire to see you,\u201d he added, bowing his head.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew left the palace he felt that all the interest and happiness the victory had afforded him had been now left in the indifferent hands of the Minister of War and the polite adjutant. The whole tenor of his thoughts instantaneously changed; the battle seemed the memory of a remote event long past.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPrince Andrew stayed at Br\u00fcnn with Bil\u00edbin, a Russian acquaintance of his in the diplomatic service.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear prince! I could not have a more welcome visitor,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin as he came out to meet Prince Andrew. \u201cFranz, put the prince\u2019s things in my bedroom,\u201d said he to the servant who was ushering Bolk\u00f3nski in. \u201cSo you\u2019re a messenger of victory, eh? Splendid! And I am sitting here ill, as you see.\u201d\n\nAfter washing and dressing, Prince Andrew came into the diplomat\u2019s luxurious study and sat down to the dinner prepared for him. Bil\u00edbin settled down comfortably beside the fire.\n\nAfter his journey and the campaign during which he had been deprived of all the comforts of cleanliness and all the refinements of life, Prince Andrew felt a pleasant sense of repose among luxurious surroundings such as he had been accustomed to from childhood. Besides it was pleasant, after his reception by the Austrians, to speak if not in Russian (for they were speaking French) at least with a Russian who would, he supposed, share the general Russian antipathy to the Austrians which was then particularly strong.\n\nBil\u00edbin was a man of thirty-five, a bachelor, and of the same circle as Prince Andrew. They had known each other previously in Petersburg, but had become more intimate when Prince Andrew was in Vienna with Kut\u00fazov. Just as Prince Andrew was a young man who gave promise of rising high in the military profession, so to an even greater extent Bil\u00edbin gave promise of rising in his diplomatic career. He was still a young man but no longer a young diplomat, as he had entered the service at the age of sixteen, had been in Paris and Copenhagen, and now held a rather important post in Vienna. Both the foreign minister and our ambassador in Vienna knew him and valued him. He was not one of those many diplomats who are esteemed because they have certain negative qualities, avoid doing certain things, and speak French. He was one of those, who, liking work, knew how to do it, and despite his indolence would sometimes spend a whole night at his writing table. He worked well whatever the import of his work. It was not the question \u201cWhat for?\u201d but the question \u201cHow?\u201d that interested him. What the diplomatic matter might be he did not care, but it gave him great pleasure to prepare a circular, memorandum, or report, skillfully, pointedly, and elegantly. Bil\u00edbin\u2019s services were valued not only for what he wrote, but also for his skill in dealing and conversing with those in the highest spheres.\n\nBil\u00edbin liked conversation as he liked work, only when it could be made elegantly witty. In society he always awaited an opportunity to say something striking and took part in a conversation only when that was possible. His conversation was always sprinkled with wittily original, finished phrases of general interest. These sayings were prepared in the inner laboratory of his mind in a portable form as if intentionally, so that insignificant society people might carry them from drawing room to drawing room. And, in fact, Bil\u00edbin\u2019s witticisms were hawked about in the Viennese drawing rooms and often had an influence on matters considered important.\n\nHis thin, worn, sallow face was covered with deep wrinkles, which always looked as clean and well washed as the tips of one\u2019s fingers after a Russian bath. The movement of these wrinkles formed the principal play of expression on his face. Now his forehead would pucker into deep folds and his eyebrows were lifted, then his eyebrows would descend and deep wrinkles would crease his cheeks. His small, deep-set eyes always twinkled and looked out straight.\n\n\u201cWell, now tell me about your exploits,\u201d said he.\n\nBolk\u00f3nski, very modestly without once mentioning himself, described the engagement and his reception by the Minister of War.\n\n\u201cThey received me and my news as one receives a dog in a game of skittles,\u201d said he in conclusion.\n\nBil\u00edbin smiled and the wrinkles on his face disappeared.\n\n\u201cCependant, mon cher,\u201d he remarked, examining his nails from a distance and puckering the skin above his left eye, \u201cmalgr\u00e9 la haute estime que je professe pour the Orthodox Russian army, j\u2019avoue que votre victoire n\u2019est pas des plus victorieuses.\u201d\n\nHe went on talking in this way in French, uttering only those words in Russian on which he wished to put a contemptuous emphasis.\n\n\u201cCome now! You with all your forces fall on the unfortunate Mortier and his one division, and even then Mortier slips through your fingers! Where\u2019s the victory?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut seriously,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cwe can at any rate say without boasting that it was a little better than at Ulm...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you capture one, just one, marshal for us?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause not everything happens as one expects or with the smoothness of a parade. We had expected, as I told you, to get at their rear by seven in the morning but had not reached it by five in the afternoon.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you do it at seven in the morning? You ought to have been there at seven in the morning,\u201d returned Bil\u00edbin with a smile. \u201cYou ought to have been there at seven in the morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did you not succeed in impressing on Bonaparte by diplomatic methods that he had better leave Genoa alone?\u201d retorted Prince Andrew in the same tone.\n\n\u201cI know,\u201d interrupted Bil\u00edbin, \u201cyou\u2019re thinking it\u2019s very easy to take marshals, sitting on a sofa by the fire! That is true, but still why didn\u2019t you capture him? So don\u2019t be surprised if not only the Minister of War but also his Most August Majesty the Emperor and King Francis is not much delighted by your victory. Even I, a poor secretary of the Russian Embassy, do not feel any need in token of my joy to give my Franz a thaler, or let him go with his Liebchen to the Prater... True, we have no Prater here...\u201d\n\nHe looked straight at Prince Andrew and suddenly unwrinkled his forehead.\n\n\u201cIt is now my turn to ask you \u2018why?\u2019 mon cher,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cI confess I do not understand: perhaps there are diplomatic subtleties here beyond my feeble intelligence, but I can\u2019t make it out. Mack loses a whole army, the Archduke Ferdinand and the Archduke Karl give no signs of life and make blunder after blunder. Kut\u00fazov alone at last gains a real victory, destroying the spell of the invincibility of the French, and the Minister of War does not even care to hear the details.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it, my dear fellow. You see it\u2019s hurrah for the Tsar, for Russia, for the Orthodox Greek faith! All that is beautiful, but what do we, I mean the Austrian court, care for your victories? Bring us nice news of a victory by the Archduke Karl or Ferdinand (one archduke\u2019s as good as another, as you know) and even if it is only over a fire brigade of Bonaparte\u2019s, that will be another story and we\u2019ll fire off some cannon! But this sort of thing seems done on purpose to vex us. The Archduke Karl does nothing, the Archduke Ferdinand disgraces himself. You abandon Vienna, give up its defense\u2014as much as to say: \u2018Heaven is with us, but heaven help you and your capital!\u2019 The one general whom we all loved, Schmidt, you expose to a bullet, and then you congratulate us on the victory! Admit that more irritating news than yours could not have been conceived. It\u2019s as if it had been done on purpose, on purpose. Besides, suppose you did gain a brilliant victory, if even the Archduke Karl gained a victory, what effect would that have on the general course of events? It\u2019s too late now when Vienna is occupied by the French army!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Occupied? Vienna occupied?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only occupied, but Bonaparte is at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, and the count, our dear Count Vrbna, goes to him for orders.\u201d\n\nAfter the fatigues and impressions of the journey, his reception, and especially after having dined, Bolk\u00f3nski felt that he could not take in the full significance of the words he heard.\n\n\u201cCount Lichtenfels was here this morning,\u201d Bil\u00edbin continued, \u201cand showed me a letter in which the parade of the French in Vienna was fully described: Prince Murat et tout le tremblement... You see that your victory is not a matter for great rejoicing and that you can\u2019t be received as a savior.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally I don\u2019t care about that, I don\u2019t care at all,\u201d said Prince Andrew, beginning to understand that his news of the battle before Krems was really of small importance in view of such events as the fall of Austria\u2019s capital. \u201cHow is it Vienna was taken? What of the bridge and its celebrated bridgehead and Prince Auersperg? We heard reports that Prince Auersperg was defending Vienna?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cPrince Auersperg is on this, on our side of the river, and is defending us\u2014doing it very badly, I think, but still he is defending us. But Vienna is on the other side. No, the bridge has not yet been taken and I hope it will not be, for it is mined and orders have been given to blow it up. Otherwise we should long ago have been in the mountains of Bohemia, and you and your army would have spent a bad quarter of an hour between two fires.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut still this does not mean that the campaign is over,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWell, I think it is. The bigwigs here think so too, but they daren\u2019t say so. It will be as I said at the beginning of the campaign, it won\u2019t be your skirmishing at D\u00fcrrenstein, or gunpowder at all, that will decide the matter, but those who devised it,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin quoting one of his own mots, releasing the wrinkles on his forehead, and pausing. \u201cThe only question is what will come of the meeting between the Emperor Alexander and the King of Prussia in Berlin? If Prussia joins the Allies, Austria\u2019s hand will be forced and there will be war. If not it is merely a question of settling where the preliminaries of the new Campo Formio are to be drawn up.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat an extraordinary genius!\u201d Prince Andrew suddenly exclaimed, clenching his small hand and striking the table with it, \u201cand what luck the man has!\u201d\n\n\u201cBuonaparte?\u201d said Bil\u00edbin inquiringly, puckering up his forehead to indicate that he was about to say something witty. \u201cBuonaparte?\u201d he repeated, accentuating the u: \u201cI think, however, now that he lays down laws for Austria at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, il faut lui faire gr\u00e2ce de l\u2019u! I shall certainly adopt an innovation and call him simply Bonaparte!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut joking apart,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cdo you really think the campaign is over?\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what I think. Austria has been made a fool of, and she is not used to it. She will retaliate. And she has been fooled in the first place because her provinces have been pillaged\u2014they say the Holy Russian army loots terribly\u2014her army is destroyed, her capital taken, and all this for the beaux yeux of His Sardinian Majesty. And therefore\u2014this is between ourselves\u2014I instinctively feel that we are being deceived, my instinct tells me of negotiations with France and projects for peace, a secret peace concluded separately.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d cried Prince Andrew. \u201cThat would be too base.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we live we shall see,\u201d replied Bil\u00edbin, his face again becoming smooth as a sign that the conversation was at an end.\n\nWhen Prince Andrew reached the room prepared for him and lay down in a clean shirt on the feather bed with its warmed and fragrant pillows, he felt that the battle of which he had brought tidings was far, far away from him. The alliance with Prussia, Austria\u2019s treachery, Bonaparte\u2019s new triumph, tomorrow\u2019s levee and parade, and the audience with the Emperor Francis occupied his thoughts.\n\nHe closed his eyes, and immediately a sound of cannonading, of musketry and the rattling of carriage wheels seemed to fill his ears, and now again drawn out in a thin line the musketeers were descending the hill, the French were firing, and he felt his heart palpitating as he rode forward beside Schmidt with the bullets merrily whistling all around, and he experienced tenfold the joy of living, as he had not done since childhood.\n\nHe woke up...\n\n\u201cYes, that all happened!\u201d he said, and, smiling happily to himself like a child, he fell into a deep, youthful slumber.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day he woke late. Recalling his recent impressions, the first thought that came into his mind was that today he had to be presented to the Emperor Francis; he remembered the Minister of War, the polite Austrian adjutant, Bil\u00edbin, and last night\u2019s conversation. Having dressed for his attendance at court in full parade uniform, which he had not worn for a long time, he went into Bil\u00edbin\u2019s study fresh, animated, and handsome, with his hand bandaged. In the study were four gentlemen of the diplomatic corps. With Prince Hippolyte Kur\u00e1gin, who was a secretary to the embassy, Bolk\u00f3nski was already acquainted. Bil\u00edbin introduced him to the others.\n\nThe gentlemen assembled at Bil\u00edbin\u2019s were young, wealthy, gay society men, who here, as in Vienna, formed a special set which Bil\u00edbin, their leader, called les n\u00f4tres. This set, consisting almost exclusively of diplomats, evidently had its own interests which had nothing to do with war or politics but related to high society, to certain women, and to the official side of the service. These gentlemen received Prince Andrew as one of themselves, an honor they did not extend to many. From politeness and to start conversation, they asked him a few questions about the army and the battle, and then the talk went off into merry jests and gossip.\n\n\u201cBut the best of it was,\u201d said one, telling of the misfortune of a fellow diplomat, \u201cthat the Chancellor told him flatly that his appointment to London was a promotion and that he was so to regard it. Can you fancy the figure he cut?...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the worst of it, gentlemen\u2014I am giving Kur\u00e1gin away to you\u2014is that that man suffers, and this Don Juan, wicked fellow, is taking advantage of it!\u201d\n\nPrince Hippolyte was lolling in a lounge chair with his legs over its arm. He began to laugh.\n\n\u201cTell me about that!\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cOh, you Don Juan! You serpent!\u201d cried several voices.\n\n\u201cYou, Bolk\u00f3nski, don\u2019t know,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin turning to Prince Andrew, \u201cthat all the atrocities of the French army (I nearly said of the Russian army) are nothing compared to what this man has been doing among the women!\u201d\n\n\u201cLa femme est la compagne de l\u2019homme,\u201d announced Prince Hippolyte, and began looking through a lorgnette at his elevated legs.\n\nBil\u00edbin and the rest of \u201cours\u201d burst out laughing in Hippolyte\u2019s face, and Prince Andrew saw that Hippolyte, of whom\u2014he had to admit\u2014he had almost been jealous on his wife\u2019s account, was the butt of this set.\n\n\u201cOh, I must give you a treat,\u201d Bil\u00edbin whispered to Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cKur\u00e1gin is exquisite when he discusses politics\u2014you should see his gravity!\u201d\n\nHe sat down beside Hippolyte and wrinkling his forehead began talking to him about politics. Prince Andrew and the others gathered round these two.\n\n\u201cThe Berlin cabinet cannot express a feeling of alliance,\u201d began Hippolyte gazing round with importance at the others, \u201cwithout expressing... as in its last note... you understand... Besides, unless His Majesty the Emperor derogates from the principle of our alliance...\n\n\u201cWait, I have not finished...\u201d he said to Prince Andrew, seizing him by the arm, \u201cI believe that intervention will be stronger than nonintervention. And...\u201d he paused. \u201cFinally one cannot impute the nonreceipt of our dispatch of November 18. That is how it will end.\u201d And he released Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s arm to indicate that he had now quite finished.\n\n\u201cDemosthenes, I know thee by the pebble thou secretest in thy golden mouth!\u201d said Bil\u00edbin, and the mop of hair on his head moved with satisfaction.\n\nEverybody laughed, and Hippolyte louder than anyone. He was evidently distressed, and breathed painfully, but could not restrain the wild laughter that convulsed his usually impassive features.\n\n\u201cWell now, gentlemen,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin, \u201cBolk\u00f3nski is my guest in this house and in Br\u00fcnn itself. I want to entertain him as far as I can, with all the pleasures of life here. If we were in Vienna it would be easy, but here, in this wretched Moravian hole, it is more difficult, and I beg you all to help me. Br\u00fcnn\u2019s attractions must be shown him. You can undertake the theater, I society, and you, Hippolyte, of course the women.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must let him see Amelie, she\u2019s exquisite!\u201d said one of \u201cours,\u201d kissing his finger tips.\n\n\u201cIn general we must turn this bloodthirsty soldier to more humane interests,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin.\n\n\u201cI shall scarcely be able to avail myself of your hospitality, gentlemen, it is already time for me to go,\u201d replied Prince Andrew looking at his watch.\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Emperor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! Oh! Oh!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, au revoir, Bolk\u00f3nski! Au revoir, Prince! Come back early to dinner,\u201d cried several voices. \u201cWe\u2019ll take you in hand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen speaking to the Emperor, try as far as you can to praise the way that provisions are supplied and the routes indicated,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin, accompanying him to the hall.\n\n\u201cI should like to speak well of them, but as far as I know the facts, I can\u2019t,\u201d replied Bolk\u00f3nski, smiling.\n\n\u201cWell, talk as much as you can, anyway. He has a passion for giving audiences, but he does not like talking himself and can\u2019t do it, as you will see.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAt the levee Prince Andrew stood among the Austrian officers as he had been told to, and the Emperor Francis merely looked fixedly into his face and just nodded to him with his long head. But after it was over, the adjutant he had seen the previous day ceremoniously informed Bolk\u00f3nski that the Emperor desired to give him an audience. The Emperor Francis received him standing in the middle of the room. Before the conversation began Prince Andrew was struck by the fact that the Emperor seemed confused and blushed as if not knowing what to say.\n\n\u201cTell me, when did the battle begin?\u201d he asked hurriedly.\n\nPrince Andrew replied. Then followed other questions just as simple: \u201cWas Kut\u00fazov well? When had he left Krems?\u201d and so on. The Emperor spoke as if his sole aim were to put a given number of questions\u2014the answers to these questions, as was only too evident, did not interest him.\n\n\u201cAt what o\u2019clock did the battle begin?\u201d asked the Emperor.\n\n\u201cI cannot inform Your Majesty at what o\u2019clock the battle began at the front, but at D\u00fcrrenstein, where I was, our attack began after five in the afternoon,\u201d replied Bolk\u00f3nski growing more animated and expecting that he would have a chance to give a reliable account, which he had ready in his mind, of all he knew and had seen. But the Emperor smiled and interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHow many miles?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom where to where, Your Majesty?\u201d\n\n\u201cFrom D\u00fcrrenstein to Krems.\u201d\n\n\u201cThree and a half miles, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe French have abandoned the left bank?\u201d\n\n\u201cAccording to the scouts the last of them crossed on rafts during the night.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs there sufficient forage in Krems?\u201d\n\n\u201cForage has not been supplied to the extent...\u201d\n\nThe Emperor interrupted him.\n\n\u201cAt what o\u2019clock was General Schmidt killed?\u201d\n\n\u201cAt seven o\u2019clock, I believe.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt seven o\u2019clock? It\u2019s very sad, very sad!\u201d\n\nThe Emperor thanked Prince Andrew and bowed. Prince Andrew withdrew and was immediately surrounded by courtiers on all sides. Everywhere he saw friendly looks and heard friendly words. Yesterday\u2019s adjutant reproached him for not having stayed at the palace, and offered him his own house. The Minister of War came up and congratulated him on the Maria Theresa Order of the third grade, which the Emperor was conferring on him. The Empress\u2019 chamberlain invited him to see Her Majesty. The archduchess also wished to see him. He did not know whom to answer, and for a few seconds collected his thoughts. Then the Russian ambassador took him by the shoulder, led him to the window, and began to talk to him.\n\nContrary to Bil\u00edbin\u2019s forecast the news he had brought was joyfully received. A thanksgiving service was arranged, Kut\u00fazov was awarded the Grand Cross of Maria Theresa, and the whole army received rewards. Bolk\u00f3nski was invited everywhere, and had to spend the whole morning calling on the principal Austrian dignitaries. Between four and five in the afternoon, having made all his calls, he was returning to Bil\u00edbin\u2019s house thinking out a letter to his father about the battle and his visit to Br\u00fcnn. At the door he found a vehicle half full of luggage. Franz, Bil\u00edbin\u2019s man, was dragging a portmanteau with some difficulty out of the front door.\n\nBefore returning to Bil\u00edbin\u2019s Prince Andrew had gone to a bookshop to provide himself with some books for the campaign, and had spent some time in the shop.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOh, your excellency!\u201d said Franz, with difficulty rolling the portmanteau into the vehicle, \u201cwe are to move on still farther. The scoundrel is again at our heels!\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? What?\u201d asked Prince Andrew.\n\nBil\u00edbin came out to meet him. His usually calm face showed excitement.\n\n\u201cThere now! Confess that this is delightful,\u201d said he. \u201cThis affair of the Thabor Bridge, at Vienna.... They have crossed without striking a blow!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew could not understand.\n\n\u201cBut where do you come from not to know what every coachman in the town knows?\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from the archduchess\u2019. I heard nothing there.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you didn\u2019t see that everybody is packing up?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not... What is it all about?\u201d inquired Prince Andrew impatiently.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s it all about? Why, the French have crossed the bridge that Auersperg was defending, and the bridge was not blown up: so Murat is now rushing along the road to Br\u00fcnn and will be here in a day or two.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? Here? But why did they not blow up the bridge, if it was mined?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what I ask you. No one, not even Bonaparte, knows why.\u201d\n\nBolk\u00f3nski shrugged his shoulders.\n\n\u201cBut if the bridge is crossed it means that the army too is lost? It will be cut off,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d answered Bil\u00edbin. \u201cListen! The French entered Vienna as I told you. Very well. Next day, which was yesterday, those gentlemen, messieurs les mar\u00e9chaux, Murat, Lannes, and Belliard, mount and ride to the bridge. (Observe that all three are Gascons.) \u2018Gentlemen,\u2019 says one of them, \u2018you know the Thabor Bridge is mined and doubly mined and that", "sequence": 3}, {"offset": 400000, "text": " there are menacing fortifications at its head and an army of fifteen thousand men has been ordered to blow up the bridge and not let us cross? But it will please our sovereign the Emperor Napoleon if we take this bridge, so let us three go and take it!\u2019 \u2018Yes, let\u2019s!\u2019 say the others. And off they go and take the bridge, cross it, and now with their whole army are on this side of the Danube, marching on us, you, and your lines of communication.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop jesting,\u201d said Prince Andrew sadly and seriously. This news grieved him and yet he was pleased.\n\nAs soon as he learned that the Russian army was in such a hopeless situation it occurred to him that it was he who was destined to lead it out of this position; that here was the Toulon that would lift him from the ranks of obscure officers and offer him the first step to fame! Listening to Bil\u00edbin he was already imagining how on reaching the army he would give an opinion at the war council which would be the only one that could save the army, and how he alone would be entrusted with the executing of the plan.\n\n\u201cStop this jesting,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI am not jesting,\u201d Bil\u00edbin went on. \u201cNothing is truer or sadder. These gentlemen ride onto the bridge alone and wave white handkerchiefs; they assure the officer on duty that they, the marshals, are on their way to negotiate with Prince Auersperg. He lets them enter the t\u00eate-de-pont. They spin him a thousand gasconades, saying that the war is over, that the Emperor Francis is arranging a meeting with Bonaparte, that they desire to see Prince Auersperg, and so on. The officer sends for Auersperg; these gentlemen embrace the officers, crack jokes, sit on the cannon, and meanwhile a French battalion gets to the bridge unobserved, flings the bags of incendiary material into the water, and approaches the t\u00eate-de-pont. At length appears the lieutenant general, our dear Prince Auersperg von Mautern himself. \u2018Dearest foe! Flower of the Austrian army, hero of the Turkish wars! Hostilities are ended, we can shake one another\u2019s hand.... The Emperor Napoleon burns with impatience to make Prince Auersperg\u2019s acquaintance.\u2019 In a word, those gentlemen, Gascons indeed, so bewildered him with fine words, and he is so flattered by his rapidly established intimacy with the French marshals, and so dazzled by the sight of Murat\u2019s mantle and ostrich plumes, qu\u2019il n\u2019y voit que du feu, et oublie celui qu\u2019il devait faire faire sur l\u2019ennemi!\u201d In spite of the animation of his speech, Bil\u00edbin did not forget to pause after this mot to give time for its due appreciation. \u201cThe French battalion rushes to the bridgehead, spikes the guns, and the bridge is taken! But what is best of all,\u201d he went on, his excitement subsiding under the delightful interest of his own story, \u201cis that the sergeant in charge of the cannon which was to give the signal to fire the mines and blow up the bridge, this sergeant, seeing that the French troops were running onto the bridge, was about to fire, but Lannes stayed his hand. The sergeant, who was evidently wiser than his general, goes up to Auersperg and says: \u2018Prince, you are being deceived, here are the French!\u2019 Murat, seeing that all is lost if the sergeant is allowed to speak, turns to Auersperg with feigned astonishment (he is a true Gascon) and says: \u2018I don\u2019t recognize the world-famous Austrian discipline, if you allow a subordinate to address you like that!\u2019 It was a stroke of genius. Prince Auersperg feels his dignity at stake and orders the sergeant to be arrested. Come, you must own that this affair of the Thabor Bridge is delightful! It is not exactly stupidity, nor rascality....\u201d\n\n\u201cIt may be treachery,\u201d said Prince Andrew, vividly imagining the gray overcoats, wounds, the smoke of gunpowder, the sounds of firing, and the glory that awaited him.\n\n\u201cNot that either. That puts the court in too bad a light,\u201d replied Bil\u00edbin. \u201cIt\u2019s not treachery nor rascality nor stupidity: it is just as at Ulm... it is...\u201d\u2014he seemed to be trying to find the right expression. \u201cC\u2019est... c\u2019est du Mack. Nous sommes mack\u00e9s (It is... it is a bit of Mack. We are Macked),\u201d he concluded, feeling that he had produced a good epigram, a fresh one that would be repeated. His hitherto puckered brow became smooth as a sign of pleasure, and with a slight smile he began to examine his nails.\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d he said suddenly to Prince Andrew who had risen and was going toward his room.\n\n\u201cI am going away.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the army.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you meant to stay another two days?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut now I am off at once.\u201d\n\nAnd Prince Andrew after giving directions about his departure went to his room.\n\n\u201cDo you know, mon cher,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin following him, \u201cI have been thinking about you. Why are you going?\u201d\n\nAnd in proof of the conclusiveness of his opinion all the wrinkles vanished from his face.\n\nPrince Andrew looked inquiringly at him and gave no reply.\n\n\u201cWhy are you going? I know you think it your duty to gallop back to the army now that it is in danger. I understand that. Mon cher, it is heroism!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cBut as you are a philosopher, be a consistent one, look at the other side of the question and you will see that your duty, on the contrary, is to take care of yourself. Leave it to those who are no longer fit for anything else.... You have not been ordered to return and have not been dismissed from here; therefore, you can stay and go with us wherever our ill luck takes us. They say we are going to Olm\u00fctz, and Olm\u00fctz is a very decent town. You and I will travel comfortably in my cal\u00e8che.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo stop joking, Bil\u00edbin,\u201d cried Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cI am speaking sincerely as a friend! Consider! Where and why are you going, when you might remain here? You are faced by one of two things,\u201d and the skin over his left temple puckered, \u201ceither you will not reach your regiment before peace is concluded, or you will share defeat and disgrace with Kut\u00fazov\u2019s whole army.\u201d\n\nAnd Bil\u00edbin unwrinkled his temple, feeling that the dilemma was insoluble.\n\n\u201cI cannot argue about it,\u201d replied Prince Andrew coldly, but he thought: \u201cI am going to save the army.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, you are a hero!\u201d said Bil\u00edbin.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThat same night, having taken leave of the Minister of War, Bolk\u00f3nski set off to rejoin the army, not knowing where he would find it and fearing to be captured by the French on the way to Krems.\n\nIn Br\u00fcnn everybody attached to the court was packing up, and the heavy baggage was already being dispatched to Olm\u00fctz. Near Hetzelsdorf Prince Andrew struck the high road along which the Russian army was moving with great haste and in the greatest disorder. The road was so obstructed with carts that it was impossible to get by in a carriage. Prince Andrew took a horse and a Cossack from a Cossack commander, and hungry and weary, making his way past the baggage wagons, rode in search of the commander in chief and of his own luggage. Very sinister reports of the position of the army reached him as he went along, and the appearance of the troops in their disorderly flight confirmed these rumors.\n\n\u201cCette arm\u00e9e russe que l\u2019or de l\u2019Angleterre a transport\u00e9e des extr\u00e9mit\u00e9s de l\u2019univers, nous allons lui faire \u00e9prouver le m\u00eame sort\u2014(le sort de l\u2019arm\u00e9e d\u2019Ulm).\u201d He remembered these words in Bonaparte\u2019s address to his army at the beginning of the campaign, and they awoke in him astonishment at the genius of his hero, a feeling of wounded pride, and a hope of glory. \u201cAnd should there be nothing left but to die?\u201d he thought. \u201cWell, if need be, I shall do it no worse than others.\u201d\n\nHe looked with disdain at the endless confused mass of detachments, carts, guns, artillery, and again baggage wagons and vehicles of all kinds overtaking one another and blocking the muddy road, three and sometimes four abreast. From all sides, behind and before, as far as ear could reach, there were the rattle of wheels, the creaking of carts and gun carriages, the tramp of horses, the crack of whips, shouts, the urging of horses, and the swearing of soldiers, orderlies, and officers. All along the sides of the road fallen horses were to be seen, some flayed, some not, and broken-down carts beside which solitary soldiers sat waiting for something, and again soldiers straggling from their companies, crowds of whom set off to the neighboring villages, or returned from them dragging sheep, fowls, hay, and bulging sacks. At each ascent or descent of the road the crowds were yet denser and the din of shouting more incessant. Soldiers floundering knee-deep in mud pushed the guns and wagons themselves. Whips cracked, hoofs slipped, traces broke, and lungs were strained with shouting. The officers directing the march rode backward and forward between the carts. Their voices were but feebly heard amid the uproar and one saw by their faces that they despaired of the possibility of checking this disorder.\n\n\u201cHere is our dear Orthodox Russian army,\u201d thought Bolk\u00f3nski, recalling Bil\u00edbin\u2019s words.\n\nWishing to find out where the commander in chief was, he rode up to a convoy. Directly opposite to him came a strange one-horse vehicle, evidently rigged up by soldiers out of any available materials and looking like something between a cart, a cabriolet, and a cal\u00e8che. A soldier was driving, and a woman enveloped in shawls sat behind the apron under the leather hood of the vehicle. Prince Andrew rode up and was just putting his question to a soldier when his attention was diverted by the desperate shrieks of the woman in the vehicle. An officer in charge of transport was beating the soldier who was driving the woman\u2019s vehicle for trying to get ahead of others, and the strokes of his whip fell on the apron of the equipage. The woman screamed piercingly. Seeing Prince Andrew she leaned out from behind the apron and, waving her thin arms from under the woolen shawl, cried:\n\n\u201cMr. Aide-de-camp! Mr. Aide-de-camp!... For heaven\u2019s sake... Protect me! What will become of us? I am the wife of the doctor of the Seventh Chasseurs.... They won\u2019t let us pass, we are left behind and have lost our people...\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll flatten you into a pancake!\u201d shouted the angry officer to the soldier. \u201cTurn back with your slut!\u201d\n\n\u201cMr. Aide-de-camp! Help me!... What does it all mean?\u201d screamed the doctor\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cKindly let this cart pass. Don\u2019t you see it\u2019s a woman?\u201d said Prince Andrew riding up to the officer.\n\nThe officer glanced at him, and without replying turned again to the soldier. \u201cI\u2019ll teach you to push on!... Back!\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them pass, I tell you!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew, compressing his lips.\n\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d cried the officer, turning on him with tipsy rage, \u201cwho are you? Are you in command here? Eh? I am commander here, not you! Go back or I\u2019ll flatten you into a pancake,\u201d repeated he. This expression evidently pleased him.\n\n\u201cThat was a nice snub for the little aide-de-camp,\u201d came a voice from behind.\n\nPrince Andrew saw that the officer was in that state of senseless, tipsy rage when a man does not know what he is saying. He saw that his championship of the doctor\u2019s wife in her queer trap might expose him to what he dreaded more than anything in the world\u2014to ridicule; but his instinct urged him on. Before the officer finished his sentence Prince Andrew, his face distorted with fury, rode up to him and raised his riding whip.\n\n\u201cKind...ly let\u2014them\u2014pass!\u201d\n\nThe officer flourished his arm and hastily rode away.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the fault of these fellows on the staff that there\u2019s this disorder,\u201d he muttered. \u201cDo as you like.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew without lifting his eyes rode hastily away from the doctor\u2019s wife, who was calling him her deliverer, and recalling with a sense of disgust the minutest details of this humiliating scene he galloped on to the village where he was told who the commander in chief was.\n\nOn reaching the village he dismounted and went to the nearest house, intending to rest if but for a moment, eat something, and try to sort out the stinging and tormenting thoughts that confused his mind. \u201cThis is a mob of scoundrels and not an army,\u201d he was thinking as he went up to the window of the first house, when a familiar voice called him by name.\n\nHe turned round. Nesv\u00edtski\u2019s handsome face looked out of the little window. Nesv\u00edtski, moving his moist lips as he chewed something, and flourishing his arm, called him to enter.\n\n\u201cBolk\u00f3nski! Bolk\u00f3nski!... Don\u2019t you hear? Eh? Come quick...\u201d he shouted.\n\nEntering the house, Prince Andrew saw Nesv\u00edtski and another adjutant having something to eat. They hastily turned round to him asking if he had any news. On their familiar faces he read agitation and alarm. This was particularly noticeable on Nesv\u00edtski\u2019s usually laughing countenance.\n\n\u201cWhere is the commander in chief?\u201d asked Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cHere, in that house,\u201d answered the adjutant.\n\n\u201cWell, is it true that it\u2019s peace and capitulation?\u201d asked Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cI was going to ask you. I know nothing except that it was all I could do to get here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd we, my dear boy! It\u2019s terrible! I was wrong to laugh at Mack, we\u2019re getting it still worse,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski. \u201cBut sit down and have something to eat.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t be able to find either your baggage or anything else now, Prince. And God only knows where your man Peter is,\u201d said the other adjutant.\n\n\u201cWhere are headquarters?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are to spend the night in Znaim.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I have got all I need into packs for two horses,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski. \u201cThey\u2019ve made up splendid packs for me\u2014fit to cross the Bohemian mountains with. It\u2019s a bad lookout, old fellow! But what\u2019s the matter with you? You must be ill to shiver like that,\u201d he added, noticing that Prince Andrew winced as at an electric shock.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing,\u201d replied Prince Andrew.\n\nHe had just remembered his recent encounter with the doctor\u2019s wife and the convoy officer.\n\n\u201cWhat is the commander in chief doing here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t make out at all,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cWell, all I can make out is that everything is abominable, abominable, quite abominable!\u201d said Prince Andrew, and he went off to the house where the commander in chief was.\n\nPassing by Kut\u00fazov\u2019s carriage and the exhausted saddle horses of his suite, with their Cossacks who were talking loudly together, Prince Andrew entered the passage. Kut\u00fazov himself, he was told, was in the house with Prince Bagrati\u00f3n and Weyrother. Weyrother was the Austrian general who had succeeded Schmidt. In the passage little Kozl\u00f3vski was squatting on his heels in front of a clerk. The clerk, with cuffs turned up, was hastily writing at a tub turned bottom upwards. Kozl\u00f3vski\u2019s face looked worn\u2014he too had evidently not slept all night. He glanced at Prince Andrew and did not even nod to him.\n\n\u201cSecond line... have you written it?\u201d he continued dictating to the clerk. \u201cThe Kiev Grenadiers, Podolian...\u201d\n\n\u201cOne can\u2019t write so fast, your honor,\u201d said the clerk, glancing angrily and disrespectfully at Kozl\u00f3vski.\n\nThrough the door came the sounds of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s voice, excited and dissatisfied, interrupted by another, an unfamiliar voice. From the sound of these voices, the inattentive way Kozl\u00f3vski looked at him, the disrespectful manner of the exhausted clerk, the fact that the clerk and Kozl\u00f3vski were squatting on the floor by a tub so near to the commander in chief, and from the noisy laughter of the Cossacks holding the horses near the window, Prince Andrew felt that something important and disastrous was about to happen.\n\nHe turned to Kozl\u00f3vski with urgent questions.\n\n\u201cImmediately, Prince,\u201d said Kozl\u00f3vski. \u201cDispositions for Bagrati\u00f3n.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about capitulation?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing of the sort. Orders are issued for a battle.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew moved toward the door from whence voices were heard. Just as he was going to open it the sounds ceased, the door opened, and Kut\u00fazov with his eagle nose and puffy face appeared in the doorway. Prince Andrew stood right in front of Kut\u00fazov but the expression of the commander in chief\u2019s one sound eye showed him to be so preoccupied with thoughts and anxieties as to be oblivious of his presence. He looked straight at his adjutant\u2019s face without recognizing him.\n\n\u201cWell, have you finished?\u201d said he to Kozl\u00f3vski.\n\n\u201cOne moment, your excellency.\u201d\n\nBagrati\u00f3n, a gaunt middle-aged man of medium height with a firm, impassive face of Oriental type, came out after the commander in chief.\n\n\u201cI have the honor to present myself,\u201d repeated Prince Andrew rather loudly, handing Kut\u00fazov an envelope.\n\n\u201cAh, from Vienna? Very good. Later, later!\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov went out into the porch with Bagrati\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by, Prince,\u201d said he to Bagrati\u00f3n. \u201cMy blessing, and may Christ be with you in your great endeavor!\u201d\n\nHis face suddenly softened and tears came into his eyes. With his left hand he drew Bagrati\u00f3n toward him, and with his right, on which he wore a ring, he made the sign of the cross over him with a gesture evidently habitual, offering his puffy cheek, but Bagrati\u00f3n kissed him on the neck instead.\n\n\u201cChrist be with you!\u201d Kut\u00fazov repeated and went toward his carriage. \u201cGet in with me,\u201d said he to Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, I should like to be of use here. Allow me to remain with Prince Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s detachment.\u201d\n\n\u201cGet in,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, and noticing that Bolk\u00f3nski still delayed, he added: \u201cI need good officers myself, need them myself!\u201d\n\nThey got into the carriage and drove for a few minutes in silence.\n\n\u201cThere is still much, much before us,\u201d he said, as if with an old man\u2019s penetration he understood all that was passing in Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s mind. \u201cIf a tenth part of his detachment returns I shall thank God,\u201d he added as if speaking to himself.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Kut\u00fazov\u2019s face only a foot distant from him and involuntarily noticed the carefully washed seams of the scar near his temple, where an Ismail bullet had pierced his skull, and the empty eye socket. \u201cYes, he has a right to speak so calmly of those men\u2019s death,\u201d thought Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cThat is why I beg to be sent to that detachment,\u201d he said.\n\nKut\u00fazov did not reply. He seemed to have forgotten what he had been saying, and sat plunged in thought. Five minutes later, gently swaying on the soft springs of the carriage, he turned to Prince Andrew. There was not a trace of agitation on his face. With delicate irony he questioned Prince Andrew about the details of his interview with the Emperor, about the remarks he had heard at court concerning the Krems affair, and about some ladies they both knew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nOn November 1 Kut\u00fazov had received, through a spy, news that the army he commanded was in an almost hopeless position. The spy reported that the French, after crossing the bridge at Vienna, were advancing in immense force upon Kut\u00fazov\u2019s line of communication with the troops that were arriving from Russia. If Kut\u00fazov decided to remain at Krems, Napoleon\u2019s army of one hundred and fifty thousand men would cut him off completely and surround his exhausted army of forty thousand, and he would find himself in the position of Mack at Ulm. If Kut\u00fazov decided to abandon the road connecting him with the troops arriving from Russia, he would have to march with no road into unknown parts of the Bohemian mountains, defending himself against superior forces of the enemy and abandoning all hope of a junction with Buxh\u00f6wden. If Kut\u00fazov decided to retreat along the road from Krems to Olm\u00fctz, to unite with the troops arriving from Russia, he risked being forestalled on that road by the French who had crossed the Vienna bridge, and encumbered by his baggage and transport, having to accept battle on the march against an enemy three times as strong, who would hem him in from two sides.\n\nKut\u00fazov chose this latter course.\n\nThe French, the spy reported, having crossed the Vienna bridge, were advancing by forced marches toward Znaim, which lay sixty-six miles off on the line of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s retreat. If he reached Znaim before the French, there would be great hope of saving the army; to let the French forestall him at Znaim meant the exposure of his whole army to a disgrace such as that of Ulm, or to utter destruction. But to forestall the French with his whole army was impossible. The road for the French from Vienna to Znaim was shorter and better than the road for the Russians from Krems to Znaim.\n\nThe night he received the news, Kut\u00fazov sent Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s vanguard, four thousand strong, to the right across the hills from the Krems-Znaim to the Vienna-Znaim road. Bagrati\u00f3n was to make this march without resting, and to halt facing Vienna with Znaim to his rear, and if he succeeded in forestalling the French he was to delay them as long as possible. Kut\u00fazov himself with all his transport took the road to Znaim.\n\nMarching thirty miles that stormy night across roadless hills, with his hungry, ill-shod soldiers, and losing a third of his men as stragglers by the way, Bagrati\u00f3n came out on the Vienna-Znaim road at Hollabr\u00fcnn a few hours ahead of the French who were approaching Hollabr\u00fcnn from Vienna. Kut\u00fazov with his transport had still to march for some days before he could reach Znaim. Hence Bagrati\u00f3n with his four thousand hungry, exhausted men would have to detain for days the whole enemy army that came upon him at Hollabr\u00fcnn, which was clearly impossible. But a freak of fate made the impossible possible. The success of the trick that had placed the Vienna bridge in the hands of the French without a fight led Murat to try to deceive Kut\u00fazov in a similar way. Meeting Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s weak detachment on the Znaim road he supposed it to be Kut\u00fazov\u2019s whole army. To be able to crush it absolutely he awaited the arrival of the rest of the troops who were on their way from Vienna, and with this object offered a three days\u2019 truce on condition that both armies should remain in position without moving. Murat declared that negotiations for peace were already proceeding, and that he therefore offered this truce to avoid unnecessary bloodshed. Count Nostitz, the Austrian general occupying the advanced posts, believed Murat\u2019s emissary and retired, leaving Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s division exposed. Another emissary rode to the Russian line to announce the peace negotiations and to offer the Russian army the three days\u2019 truce. Bagrati\u00f3n replied that he was not authorized either to accept or refuse a truce and sent his adjutant to Kut\u00fazov to report the offer he had received.\n\nA truce was Kut\u00fazov\u2019s sole chance of gaining time, giving Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s exhausted troops some rest, and letting the transport and heavy convoys (whose movements were concealed from the French) advance if but one stage nearer Znaim. The offer of a truce gave the only, and a quite unexpected, chance of saving the army. On receiving the news he immediately dispatched Adjutant General Wintzingerode, who was in attendance on him, to the enemy camp. Wintzingerode was not merely to agree to the truce but also to offer terms of capitulation, and meanwhile Kut\u00fazov sent his adjutants back to hasten to the utmost the movements of the baggage trains of the entire army along the Krems-Znaim road. Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s exhausted and hungry detachment, which alone covered this movement of the transport and of the whole army, had to remain stationary in face of an enemy eight times as strong as itself.\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s expectations that the proposals of capitulation (which were in no way binding) might give time for part of the transport to pass, and also that Murat\u2019s mistake would very soon be discovered, proved correct. As soon as Bonaparte (who was at Sch\u00f6nbrunn, sixteen miles from Hollabr\u00fcnn) received Murat\u2019s dispatch with the proposal of a truce and a capitulation, he detected a ruse and wrote the following letter to Murat:\n\nSch\u00f6nbrunn, 25th Brumaire, 1805,\n\nat eight o\u2019clock in the morning\n\nTo PRINCE MURAT,\n\nI cannot find words to express to you my displeasure. You command only my advance guard, and have no right to arrange an armistice without my order. You are causing me to lose the fruits of a campaign. Break the armistice immediately and march on the enemy. Inform him that the general who signed that capitulation had no right to do so, and that no one but the Emperor of Russia has that right.\n\nIf, however, the Emperor of Russia ratifies that convention, I will ratify it; but it is only a trick. March on, destroy the Russian army.... You are in a position to seize its baggage and artillery.\n\nThe Russian Emperor\u2019s aide-de-camp is an impostor. Officers are nothing when they have no powers; this one had none.... The Austrians let themselves be tricked at the crossing of the Vienna bridge, you are letting yourself be tricked by an aide-de-camp of the Emperor.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\nBonaparte\u2019s adjutant rode full gallop with this menacing letter to Murat. Bonaparte himself, not trusting to his generals, moved with all the Guards to the field of battle, afraid of letting a ready victim escape, and Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s four thousand men merrily lighted campfires, dried and warmed themselves, cooked their porridge for the first time for three days, and not one of them knew or imagined what was in store for him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nBetween three and four o\u2019clock in the afternoon Prince Andrew, who had persisted in his request to Kut\u00fazov, arrived at Grunth and reported himself to Bagrati\u00f3n. Bonaparte\u2019s adjutant had not yet reached Murat\u2019s detachment and the battle had not yet begun. In Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s detachment no one knew anything of the general position of affairs. They talked of peace but did not believe in its possibility; others talked of a battle but also disbelieved in the nearness of an engagement. Bagrati\u00f3n, knowing Bolk\u00f3nski to be a favorite and trusted adjutant, received him with distinction and special marks of favor, explaining to him that there would probably be an engagement that day or the next, and giving him full liberty to remain with him during the battle or to join the rearguard and have an eye on the order of retreat, \u201cwhich is also very important.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, there will hardly be an engagement today,\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n as if to reassure Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cIf he is one of the ordinary little staff dandies sent to earn a medal he can get his reward just as well in the rearguard, but if he wishes to stay with me, let him... he\u2019ll be of use here if he\u2019s a brave officer,\u201d thought Bagrati\u00f3n. Prince Andrew, without replying, asked the prince\u2019s permission to ride round the position to see the disposition of the forces, so as to know his bearings should he be sent to execute an order. The officer on duty, a handsome, elegantly dressed man with a diamond ring on his forefinger, who was fond of speaking French though he spoke it badly, offered to conduct Prince Andrew.\n\nOn all sides they saw rain-soaked officers with dejected faces who seemed to be seeking something, and soldiers dragging doors, benches, and fencing from the village.\n\n\u201cThere now, Prince! We can\u2019t stop those fellows,\u201d said the staff officer pointing to the soldiers. \u201cThe officers don\u2019t keep them in hand. And there,\u201d he pointed to a sutler\u2019s tent, \u201cthey crowd in and sit. This morning I turned them all out and now look, it\u2019s full again. I must go there, Prince, and scare them a bit. It won\u2019t take a moment.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, let\u2019s go in and I will get myself a roll and some cheese,\u201d said Prince Andrew who had not yet had time to eat anything.\n\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019t you mention it, Prince? I would have offered you something.\u201d\n\nThey dismounted and entered the tent. Several officers, with flushed and weary faces, were sitting at the table eating and drinking.\n\n\u201cNow what does this mean, gentlemen?\u201d said the staff officer, in the reproachful tone of a man who has repeated the same thing more than once. \u201cYou know it won\u2019t do to leave your posts like this. The prince gave orders that no one should leave his post. Now you, Captain,\u201d and he turned to a thin, dirty little artillery officer who without his boots (he had given them to the canteen keeper to dry), in only his stockings, rose when they entered, smiling not altogether comfortably.\n\n\u201cWell, aren\u2019t you ashamed of yourself, Captain T\u00fashin?\u201d he continued. \u201cOne would think that as an artillery officer you would set a good example, yet here you are without your boots! The alarm will be sounded and you\u2019ll be in a pretty position without your boots!\u201d (The staff officer smiled.) \u201cKindly return to your posts, gentlemen, all of you, all!\u201d he added in a tone of command.\n\nPrince Andrew smiled involuntarily as he looked at the artillery officer T\u00fashin, who silent and smiling, shifting from one stockinged foot to the other, glanced inquiringly with his large, intelligent, kindly eyes from Prince Andrew to the staff officer.\n\n\u201cThe soldiers say it feels easier without boots,\u201d said Captain T\u00fashin smiling shyly in his uncomfortable position, evidently wishing to adopt a jocular tone. But before he had finished he felt that his jest was unacceptable and had not come off. He grew confused.\n\n\u201cKindly return to your posts,\u201d said the staff officer trying to preserve his gravity.\n\nPrince Andrew glanced again at the artillery officer\u2019s small figure. There was something peculiar about it, quite unsoldierly, rather comic, but extremely attractive.\n\nThe staff officer and Prince Andrew mounted their horses and rode on.\n\nHaving ridden beyond the village, continually meeting and overtaking soldiers and officers of various regiments, they saw on their left some entrenchments being thrown up, the freshly dug clay of which showed up red. Several battalions of soldiers, in their shirt sleeves despite the cold wind, swarmed in these earthworks like a host of white ants; spadefuls of red clay were continually being thrown up from behind the bank by unseen hands. Prince Andrew and the officer rode up, looked at the entrenchment, and went on again. Just behind it they came upon some dozens of soldiers, continually replaced by others, who ran from the entrenchment. They had to hold their noses and put their horses to a trot to escape from the poisoned atmosphere of these latrines.\n\n\u201cVoil\u00e0 l\u2019agr\u00e9ment des camps, monsieur le prince,\u201d said the staff officer.\n\nThey rode up the opposite hill. From there the French could already be seen. Prince Andrew stopped and began examining the position.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s our battery,\u201d said the staff officer indicating the highest point. \u201cIt\u2019s in charge of the queer fellow we saw without his boots. You can see everything from there; let\u2019s go there, Prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you very much, I will go on alone,\u201d said Prince Andrew, wishing to rid himself of this staff officer\u2019s company, \u201cplease don\u2019t trouble yourself further.\u201d\n\nThe staff officer remained behind and Prince Andrew rode on alone.\n\nThe farther forward and nearer the enemy he went, the more orderly and cheerful were the troops. The greatest disorder and depression had been in the baggage train he had passed that morning on the Znaim road seven miles away from the French. At Grunth also some apprehension and alarm could be felt, but the nearer Prince Andrew came to the French lines the more confident was the appearance of our troops. The soldiers in their greatcoats were ranged in lines, the sergeants major and company officers were counting the men, poking the last man in each section in the ribs and telling him to hold his hand up. Soldiers scattered over the whole place were dragging logs and brushwood and were building shelters with merry chatter and laughter; around the fires sat others, dressed and undressed, drying their shirts and leg bands or mending boots or overcoats and crowding round the boilers and porridge cookers. In one company dinner was ready, and the soldiers were gazing eagerly at the steaming boiler, waiting till the sample, which a quartermaster sergeant was carrying in a wooden bowl to an officer who sat on a log before his shelter, had been tasted.\n\nAnother company, a lucky one for not all the companies had vodka, crowded round a pockmarked, broad-shouldered sergeant major who, tilting a keg, filled one after another the canteen lids held out to him. The soldiers lifted the canteen lids to their lips with reverential faces, emptied them, rolling the vodka in their mouths, and walked away from the sergeant major with brightened expressions, licking their lips and wiping them on the sleeves of their greatcoats. All their faces were as serene as if all this were happening at home awaiting peaceful encampment, and not within sight of the enemy before an action in which at least half of them would be left on the field. After passing a chasseur regiment and in the lines of the Kiev grenadiers\u2014fine fellows busy with similar peaceful affairs\u2014near the shelter of the regimental commander, higher than and different from the others, Prince Andrew came out in front of a platoon of grenadiers before whom lay a naked man. Two soldiers held him while two others were flourishing their switches and striking him regularly on his bare back. The man shrieked unnaturally. A stout major was pacing up and down the line, and regardless of the screams kept repeating:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a shame for a soldier to steal; a soldier must be honest, honorable, and brave, but if he robs his fellows there is no honor in him, he\u2019s a scoundrel. Go on! Go on!\u201d\n\nSo the swishing sound of the strokes, and the desperate but unnatural screams, continued.\n\n\u201cGo on, go on!\u201d said the major.\n\nA young officer with a bewildered and pained expression on his face stepped away from the man and looked round inquiringly at the adjutant as he rode by.\n\nPrince Andrew, having reached the front line, rode along it. Our front line and that of the enemy were far apart on the right and left flanks, but in the center where the men with a flag of truce had passed that morning, the lines were so near together that the men could see one another\u2019s faces and speak to one another. Besides the soldiers who formed the picket line on either side, there were many curious onlookers who, jesting and laughing, stared at their strange foreign enemies.\n\nSince early morning\u2014despite an injunction not to approach the picket line\u2014the officers had been unable to keep sight-seers away. The soldiers forming the picket line, like showmen exhibiting a curiosity, no longer looked at the French but paid attention to the sight-seers and grew weary waiting to be relieved. Prince Andrew halted to have a look at the French.\n\n\u201cLook! Look there!\u201d one soldier was saying to another, pointing to a Russian musketeer who had gone up to the picket line with an officer and was rapidly and excitedly talking to a French grenadier. \u201cHark to him jabbering! Fine, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s all the Frenchy can do to keep up with him. There now, S\u00eddorov!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a bit and listen. It\u2019s fine!\u201d answered S\u00eddorov, who was considered an adept at French.\n\nThe soldier to whom the laughers referred was D\u00f3lokhov. Prince Andrew recognized him and stopped to listen to what he was saying. D\u00f3lokhov had come from the left flank where their regiment was stationed, with his captain.\n\n\u201cNow then, go on, go on!\u201d incited the officer, bending forward and trying not to lose a word of the speech which was incomprehensible to him. \u201cMore, please: more! What\u2019s he saying?\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov did not answer the captain; he had been drawn into a hot dispute with the French grenadier. They were naturally talking about the campaign. The Frenchman, confusing the Austrians with the Russians, was trying to prove that the Russians had surrendered and had fled all the way from Ulm, while D\u00f3lokhov maintained that the Russians had not surrendered but had beaten the French.\n\n\u201cWe have orders to drive you off here, and we shall drive you off,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cOnly take care you and your Cossacks are not all captured!\u201d said the French grenadier.\n\nThe French onlookers and listeners laughed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll make you dance as we did under Suv\u00f3rov...,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cQu\u2019 est-ce qu\u2019il chante?\u201d asked a Frenchman.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ancient history,\u201d said another, guessing that it referred to a former war. \u201cThe Emperor will teach your Suvara as he has taught the others...\u201d\n\n\u201cBonaparte...\u201d began D\u00f3lokhov, but the Frenchman interrupted him.\n\n\u201cNot Bonaparte. He is the Emperor! Sacr\u00e9 nom...!\u201d cried he angrily.\n\n\u201cThe devil skin your Emperor.\u201d\n\nAnd D\u00f3lokhov swore at him in coarse soldier\u2019s Russian and shouldering his musket walked away.\n\n\u201cLet us go, Iv\u00e1n Luk\u00edch,\u201d he said to the captain.\n\n\u201cAh, that\u2019s the way to talk French,\u201d said the picket soldiers. \u201cNow, S\u00eddorov, you have a try!\u201d\n\nS\u00eddorov, turning to the French, winked, and began to jabber meaningless sounds very fast: \u201cKari, mala, tafa, safi, muter, Kask\u00e1,\u201d he said, trying to give an expressive intonation to his voice.\n\n\u201cHo! ho! ho! Ha! ha! ha! ha! Ouh! ouh!\u201d came peals of such healthy and good-humored laughter from the soldiers that it infected the French involuntarily, so much so that the only thing left to do seemed to be to unload the muskets, explode the ammunition, and all return home as quickly as possible.\n\nBut the guns remained loaded, the loopholes in blockhouses and entrenchments looked out just as menacingly, and the unlimbered cannon confronted one another as before.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nHaving ridden round the whole line from right flank to left, Prince Andrew made his way up to the battery from which the staff officer had told him the whole field could be seen. Here he dismounted, and stopped beside the farthest of the four unlimbered cannon. Before the guns an artillery sentry was pacing up and down; he stood at attention when the officer arrived, but at a sign resumed his measured, monotonous pacing. Behind the guns were their limbers and still farther back picket ropes and artillerymen\u2019s bonfires. To the left, not far from the farthest cannon, was a small, newly constructed wattle shed from which came the sound of officers\u2019 voices in eager conversation.\n\nIt was true that a view over nearly the whole Russian position and the greater part of the enemy\u2019s opened out from this battery. Just facing it, on the crest of the opposite hill, the village of Sch\u00f6n Grabern could be seen, and in three places to left and right the French troops amid the smoke of their campfires, the greater part of whom were evidently in the village itself and behind the hill. To the left from that village, amid the smoke, was something resembling a battery, but it was impossible to see it clearly with the naked eye. Our right flank was posted on a rather steep incline which dominated the French position. Our infantry were stationed there, and at the farthest point the dragoons. In the center, where T\u00fashin\u2019s battery stood and from which Prince Andrew was surveying the position, was the easiest and most direct descent and ascent to the brook separating us from Sch\u00f6n Grabern. On the left our troops were close to a copse, in which smoked the bonfires of our infantry who were felling wood. The French line was wider than ours, and it was plain that they could easily outflank us on both sides. Behind our position was a steep and deep dip, making it difficult for artillery and cavalry to retire. Prince Andrew took out his notebook and, leaning on the cannon, sketched a plan of the position. He made some notes on two points, intending to mention them to Bagrati\u00f3n. His idea was, first, to concentrate all the artillery in the center, and secondly, to withdraw the cavalry to the other side of the dip. Prince Andrew, being always near the commander in chief, closely following the mass movements and general orders, and constantly studying historical accounts of battles, involuntarily pictured to himself the course of events in the forthcoming action in broad outline. He imagined only important possibilities: \u201cIf the enemy attacks the right flank,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cthe Kiev grenadiers and the Pod\u00f3lsk chasseurs must hold their position till reserves from the center come up. In that case the dragoons could successfully make a flank counterattack. If they attack our center we, having the center battery on this high ground, shall withdraw the left flank under its cover, and retreat to the dip by echelons.\u201d So he reasoned.... All the time he had been beside the gun, he had heard the voices of the officers distinctly, but as often happens had not understood a word of what they were saying. Suddenly, however, he was struck by a voice coming from the shed, and its tone was so sincere that he could not but listen.\n\n\u201cNo, friend,\u201d said a pleasant and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, a familiar voice, \u201cwhat I say is that if it were possible to know what is beyond death, none of us would be afraid of it. That\u2019s so, friend.\u201d\n\nAnother, a younger voice, interrupted him: \u201cAfraid or not, you can\u2019t escape it anyhow.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same, one is afraid! Oh, you clever people,\u201d said a third manly voice interrupting them both. \u201cOf course you artillery men are very wise, because you can take everything along with you\u2014vodka and snacks.\u201d\n\nAnd the owner of the manly voice, evidently an infantry officer, laughed.\n\n\u201cYes, one is afraid,\u201d continued the first speaker, he of the familiar voice. \u201cOne is afraid of the unknown, that\u2019s what it is. Whatever we may say about the soul going to the sky... we know there is no sky but only an atmosphere.\u201d\n\nThe manly voice again interrupted the artillery officer.\n\n\u201cWell, stand us some of your herb vodka, T\u00fashin,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cWhy,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cthat\u2019s the captain who stood up in the sutler\u2019s hut without his boots.\u201d He recognized the agreeable, philosophizing voice with pleasure.\n\n\u201cSome herb vodka? Certainly!\u201d said T\u00fashin. \u201cBut still, to conceive a future life...\u201d\n\nHe did not finish. Just then there was a whistle in the air; nearer and nearer, faster and louder, louder and faster, a cannon ball, as if it had not finished saying what was necessary, thudded into the ground near the shed with super human force, throwing up a mass of earth. The ground seemed to groan at the terrible impact.\n\nAnd immediately T\u00fashin, with a short pipe in the corner of his mouth and his kind, intelligent face rather pale, rushed out of the shed followed by the owner of the manly voice, a dashing infantry officer who hurried off to his company, buttoning up his coat as he ran.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nMounting his horse again Prince Andrew lingered with the battery, looking at the puff from the gun that had sent the ball. His eyes ran rapidly over the wide space, but he only saw that the hitherto motionless masses of the French now swayed and that there really was a battery to their left. The smoke above it had not yet dispersed. Two mounted Frenchmen, probably adjutants, were galloping up the hill. A small but distinctly visible enemy column was moving down the hill, probably to strengthen the front line. The smoke of the first shot had not yet dispersed before another puff appeared, followed by a report. The battle had begun! Prince Andrew turned his horse and galloped back to Grunth to find Prince Bagrati\u00f3n. He heard the cannonade behind him growing louder and more frequent. Evidently our guns had begun to reply. From the bottom of the slope, where the parleys had taken place, came the report of musketry.\n\nLemarrois had just arrived at a gallop with Bonaparte\u2019s stern letter, and Murat, humiliated and anxious to expiate his fault, had at once moved his forces to attack the center and outflank both the Russian wings, hoping before evening and before the arrival of the Emperor to crush the contemptible detachment that stood before him.\n\n\u201cIt has begun. Here it is!\u201d thought Prince Andrew, feeling the blood rush to his heart. \u201cBut where and how will my Toulon present itself?\u201d\n\nPassing between the companies that had been eating porridge and drinking vodka a quarter of an hour before, he saw everywhere the same rapid movement of soldiers forming ranks and getting their muskets ready, and on all their faces he recognized the same eagerness that filled his heart. \u201cIt has begun! Here it is, dreadful but enjoyable!\u201d was what the face of each soldier and each officer seemed to say.\n\nBefore he had reached the embankments that were being thrown up, he saw, in the light of the dull autumn evening, mounted men coming toward him. The foremost, wearing a Cossack cloak and lambskin cap and riding a white horse, was Prince Bagrati\u00f3n. Prince Andrew stopped, waiting for him to come up; Prince Bagrati\u00f3n reined in his horse and recognizing Prince Andrew nodded to him. He still looked ahead while Prince Andrew told him what he had seen.\n\nThe feeling, \u201cIt has begun! Here it is!\u201d was seen even on Prince Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s hard brown face with its half-closed, dull, sleepy eyes. Prince Andrew gazed with anxious curiosity at that impassive face and wished he could tell what, if anything, this man was thinking and feeling at that moment. \u201cIs there anything at all behind that impassive face?\u201d Prince Andrew asked himself as he looked. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n bent his head in sign of agreement with what Prince Andrew told him, and said, \u201cVery good!\u201d in a tone that seemed to imply that everything that took place and was reported to him was exactly what he had foreseen. Prince Andrew, out of breath with his rapid ride, spoke quickly. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, uttering his words with an Oriental accent, spoke particularly slowly, as if to impress the fact that there was no need to hurry. However, he put his horse to a trot in the direction of T\u00fashin\u2019s battery. Prince Andrew followed with the suite. Behind Prince Bagrati\u00f3n rode an officer of the suite, the prince\u2019s personal adjutant, Zherk\u00f3v, an orderly officer, the staff officer on duty, riding a fine bobtailed horse, and a civilian\u2014an accountant who had asked permission to be present at the battle out of curiosity. The accountant, a stout, full-faced man, looked around him with a na\u00efve smile of satisfaction and presented a strange appearance among the hussars, Cossacks, and adjutants, in his camlet coat, as he jolted on his horse with a convoy officer\u2019s saddle.\n\n\u201cHe wants to see a battle,\u201d said Zherk\u00f3v to Bolk\u00f3nski, pointing to the accountant, \u201cbut he feels a pain in the pit of his stomach already.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, leave off!\u201d said the accountant with a beaming but rather cunning smile, as if flattered at being made the subject of Zherk\u00f3v\u2019s joke, and purposely trying to appear stupider than he really was.\n\n\u201cIt is very strange, mon Monsieur Prince,\u201d said the staff officer. (He remembered that in French there is some peculiar way of addressing a prince, but could not get it quite right.)\n\nBy this time they were all approaching T\u00fashin\u2019s battery, and a ball struck the ground in front of them.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that that has fallen?\u201d asked the accountant with a na\u00efve smile.\n\n\u201cA French pancake,\u201d answered Zherk\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what they hit with?\u201d asked the accountant. \u201cHow awful!\u201d\n\nHe seemed to swell with satisfaction. He had hardly finished speaking when they again heard an unexpectedly violent whistling which suddenly ended with a thud into something soft... f-f-flop! and a Cossack, riding a little to their right and behind the accountant, crashed to earth with his horse. Zherk\u00f3v and the staff officer bent over their saddles and turned their horses away. The accountant stopped, facing the Cossack, and examined him with attentive curiosity. The Cossack was dead, but the horse still struggled.\n\nPrince Bagrati\u00f3n screwed up his eyes, looked round, and, seeing the cause of the confusion, turned away with indifference, as if to say, \u201cIs it worth while noticing trifles?\u201d He reined in his horse with the care of a skillful rider and, slightly bending over, disengaged his saber which had caught in his cloak. It was an old-fashioned saber of a kind no longer in general use. Prince Andrew remembered the story of Suv\u00f3rov giving his saber to Bagrati\u00f3n in Italy, and the recollection was particularly pleasant at that moment. They had reached the battery at which Prince Andrew had been when he examined the battlefield.\n\n\u201cWhose company?\u201d asked Prince Bagrati\u00f3n of an artilleryman standing by the ammunition wagon.\n\nHe asked, \u201cWhose company?\u201d but he really meant, \u201cAre you frightened here?\u201d and the artilleryman understood him.\n\n\u201cCaptain T\u00fashin\u2019s, your excellency!\u201d shouted the red-haired, freckled gunner in a merry voice, standing to attention.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d muttered Bagrati\u00f3n as if considering something, and he rode past the limbers to the farthest cannon.\n\nAs he approached, a ringing shot issued from it deafening him and his suite, and in the smoke that suddenly surrounded the gun they could see the gunners who had seized it straining to roll it quickly back to its former position. A huge, broad-shouldered gunner, Number One, holding a mop, his legs far apart, sprang to the wheel; while Number Two with a trembling hand placed a charge in the cannon\u2019s mouth. The short, round-shouldered Captain T\u00fashin, stumbling over the tail of the gun carriage, moved forward and, not noticing the general, looked out shading his eyes with his small hand.\n\n\u201cLift it two lines more and it will be just right,\u201d cried he in a feeble voice to which he tried to impart a dashing note, ill-suited to his weak figure. \u201cNumber Two!\u201d he squeaked. \u201cFire, Medv\u00e9dev!\u201d\n\nBagrati\u00f3n called to him, and T\u00fashin, raising three fingers to his cap with a bashful and awkward gesture not at all like a military salute but like a priest\u2019s benediction, approached the general. Though T\u00fashin\u2019s guns had been intended to cannonade the valley, he was firing incendiary balls at the village of Sch\u00f6n Grabern visible just opposite, in front of which large masses of French were advancing.\n\nNo one had given T\u00fashin orders where and at what to fire, but after consulting his sergeant major, Zakharch\u00e9nko, for whom he had great respect, he had decided that it would be a good thing to set fire to the village. \u201cVery good!\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n in reply to the officer\u2019s report, and began deliberately to examine the whole battlefield extended before him. The French had advanced nearest on our right. Below the height on which the Kiev regiment was stationed, in the hollow where the rivulet flowed, the soul-stirring rolling and crackling of musketry was heard, and much farther to the right beyond the dragoons, the officer of the suite pointed out to Bagrati\u00f3n a French column that was outflanking us. To the left the horizon bounded by the adjacent wood. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n ordered two battalions from the center to be sent to reinforce the right flank. The officer of the suite ventured to remark to the prince that if these battalions went away, the guns would remain without support. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n turned to the officer and with his dull eyes looked at him in silence. It seemed to Prince Andrew that the officer\u2019s remark was just and that really no answer could be made to it. But at that moment an adjutant galloped up with a message from the commander of the regiment in the hollow and news that immense masses of the French were coming down upon them and that his regiment was in disorder and was retreating upon the Kiev grenadiers. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n bowed his head in sign of assent and approval. He rode off at a walk to the right and sent an adjutant to the dragoons with orders to attack the French. But this adjutant returned half an hour later with the news that the commander of the dragoons had already retreated beyond the dip in the ground, as a heavy fire had been opened on him and he was losing men uselessly, and so had hastened to throw some sharpshooters into the wood.\n\n\u201cVery good!\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n.\n\nAs he was leaving the battery, firing was heard on the left also, and as it was too far to the left flank for him to have time to go there himself, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n sent Zherk\u00f3v to tell the general in command (the one who had paraded his regiment before Kut\u00fazov at Braunau) that he must retreat as quickly as possible behind the hollow in the rear, as the right flank would probably not be able to withstand the enemy\u2019s attack very long. About T\u00fashin and the battalion that had been in support of his battery all was forgotten. Prince Andrew listened attentively to Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s colloquies with the commanding officers and the orders he gave them and, to his surprise, found that no orders were really given, but that Prince Bagrati\u00f3n tried to make it appear that everything done by necessity, by accident, or by the will of subordinate commanders was done, if not by his direct command, at least in accord with his intentions. Prince Andrew noticed, however, that though what happened was due to chance and was independent of the commander\u2019s will, owing to the tact Bagrati\u00f3n showed, his presence was very valuable. Officers who approached him with disturbed countenances became calm; soldiers and officers greeted him gaily, grew more cheerful in his presence, and were evidently anxious to display their courage before him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nPrince Bagrati\u00f3n, having reached the highest point of our right flank, began riding downhill to where the roll of musketry was heard but where on account of the smoke nothing could be seen. The nearer they got to the hollow the less they could see but the more they felt the nearness of the actual battlefield. They began to meet wounded men. One with a bleeding head and no cap was being dragged along by two soldiers who supported him under the arms. There was a gurgle in his throat and he was spitting blood. A bullet had evidently hit him in the throat or mouth. Another was walking sturdily by himself but without his musket, groaning aloud and swinging his arm which had just been hurt, while blood from it was streaming over his greatcoat as from a bottle. He had that moment been wounded and his face showed fear rather than suffering. Crossing a road they descended a steep incline and saw several men lying on the ground; they also met a crowd of soldiers some of whom were unwounded. The soldiers were ascending the hill breathing heavily, and despite the general\u2019s presence were talking loudly and gesticulating. In front of them rows of gray cloaks were already visible through the smoke, and an officer catching sight of Bagrati\u00f3n rushed shouting after the crowd of retreating soldiers, ordering them back. Bagrati\u00f3n rode up to the ranks along which shots crackled now here and now there, drowning the sound of voices and the shouts of command. The whole air reeked with smoke. The excited faces of the soldiers were blackened with it. Some were using their ramrods, others putting powder on the touchpans or taking charges from their pouches, while others were firing, though who they were firing at could not be seen for the smoke which there was no wind to carry away. A pleasant humming and whistling of bullets were often heard. \u201cWhat is this?\u201d thought Prince Andrew approaching the crowd of soldiers. \u201cIt can\u2019t be an attack, for they are not moving; it can\u2019t be a square\u2014for they are not drawn up for that.\u201d\n\nThe commander of the regiment, a thin, feeble-looking old man with a pleasant smile\u2014his eyelids drooping more than half over his old eyes, giving him a mild expression, rode up to Bagrati\u00f3n and welcomed him as a host welcomes an honored guest. He reported that his regiment had been attacked by French cavalry and that, though the attack had been repulsed, he had lost more than half his men. He said the attack had been repulsed, employing this military term to describe what had occurred to his regiment, but in reality he did not himself know what had happened during that half-hour to the troops entrusted to him, and could not say with certainty whether the attack had been repulsed or his regiment had been broken up. All he knew was that at the commencement of the action balls and shells began flying all over his regiment and hitting men and that afterwards someone had shouted \u201cCavalry!\u201d and our men had begun firing. They were still firing, not at the cavalry which had disappeared, but at French infantry who had come into the hollow and were firing at our men. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n bowed his head as a sign that this was exactly what he had desired and expected. Turning to his adjutant he ordered him to bring down the two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs whom they had just passed. Prince Andrew was struck by the changed expression on Prince Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s face at this moment. It expressed the concentrated and happy resolution you see on the face of a man who on a hot day takes a final run before plunging into the water. The dull, sleepy expression was no longer there, nor the affectation of profound thought. The round, steady, hawk\u2019s eyes looked before him eagerly and rather disdainfully, not resting on anything although his movements were still slow and measured.\n\nThe commander of the regiment turned to Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, entreating him to go back as it was too dangerous to remain where they were. \u201cPlease, your excellency, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d he kept saying, glancing for support at an officer of the suite who turned away from him. \u201cThere, you see!\u201d and he drew attention to the bullets whistling, singing, and hissing continually around them. He spoke in the tone of entreaty and reproach that a carpenter uses to a gentleman who has picked up an ax: \u201cWe are used to it, but you, sir, will blister your hands.\u201d He spoke as if those bullets could not kill him, and his half-closed eyes gave still more persuasiveness to his words. The staff officer joined in the colonel\u2019s appeals, but Bagrati\u00f3n did not reply; he only gave an order to cease firing and re-form, so as to give room for the two approaching battalions. While he was speaking, the curtain of smoke that had concealed the hollow, driven by a rising wind, began to move from right to left as if drawn by an invisible hand, and the hill opposite, with the French moving about on it, opened out before them. All eyes fastened involuntarily on this French column advancing against them and winding down over the uneven ground. One could already see the soldiers\u2019 shaggy caps, distinguish the officers from the men, and see the standard flapping against its staff.\n\n\u201cThey march splendidly,\u201d remarked someone in Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s suite.\n\nThe head of the column had already descended into the hollow. The clash would take place on this side of it...\n\nThe remains of our regiment which had been in action rapidly formed up and moved to the right; from behind it, dispersing the laggards, came two battalions of the Sixth Chasseurs in fine order. Before they had reached Bagrati\u00f3n, the weighty tread of the mass of men marching in step could be heard. On their left flank, nearest to Bagrati\u00f3n, marched a company commander, a fine round-faced man, with a stupid and happy expression\u2014the same man who had rushed out of the wattle shed. At that moment he was clearly thinking of nothing but how dashing a fellow he would appear as he passed the commander.\n\nWith the self-satisfaction of a man on parade, he stepped lightly with his muscular legs as if sailing along, stretching himself to his full height without the smallest effort, his ease contrasting with the heavy tread of the soldiers who were keeping step with him. He carried close to his leg a narrow unsheathed sword (small, curved, and not like a real weapon) and looked now at the superior officers and now back at the men without losing step, his whole powerful body turning flexibly. It was as if all the powers of his soul were concentrated on passing the commander in the best possible manner, and feeling that he was doing it well he was happy. \u201cLeft... left... left...\u201d he seemed to repeat to himself at each alternate step; and in time to this, with stern but varied faces, the wall of soldiers burdened with knapsacks and muskets marched in step, and each one of these hundreds of soldiers seemed to be repeating to himself at each alternate step, \u201cLeft... left... left...\u201d A fat major skirted a bush, puffing and falling out of step; a soldier who had fallen behind, his face showing alarm at his defection, ran at a trot, panting to catch up with his company. A cannon ball, cleaving the air, flew over the heads of Bagrati\u00f3n and his suite, and fell into the column to the measure of \u201cLeft... left!\u201d \u201cClose up!\u201d came the company commander\u2019s voice in jaunty tones. The soldiers passed in a semicircle round something where the ball had fallen, and an old trooper on the flank, a noncommissioned officer who had stopped beside the dead men, ran to catch up his line and, falling into step with a hop, looked back angrily, and through the ominous silence and the regular tramp of feet beating the ground in unison, one seemed to hear left... left... left.\n\n\u201cWell done, lads!\u201d said Prince Bagrati\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cGlad to do our best, your ex\u2019len-lency!\u201d came a confused shout from the ranks. A morose soldier marching on the left turned his eyes on Bagrati\u00f3n as he shouted, with an expression that seemed to say: \u201cWe know that ourselves!\u201d Another, without looking round, as though fearing to relax, shouted with his mouth wide open and passed on.\n\nThe order was given to halt and down knapsacks.\n\nBagrati\u00f3n rode round the ranks that had marched past him and dismounted. He gave the reins to a Cossack, took off and handed over his felt coat, stretched his legs, and set his cap straight. The head of the French column, with its officers leading, appeared from below the hill.\n\n\u201cForward, with God!\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n, in a resolute, sonorous voice, turning for a moment to the front line, and slightly swinging his arms, he went forward uneasily over the rough field with the awkward gait of a cavalryman. Prince Andrew felt that an invisible power was leading him forward, and experienced great happiness.\n\nThe French were already near. Prince Andrew, walking beside Bagrati\u00f3n, could clearly distinguish their bandoliers, red epaulets, and even their faces. (He distinctly saw an old French officer who, with gaitered legs and turned-out toes, climbed the hill with difficulty.) Prince Bagrati\u00f3n gave no further orders and silently continued to walk on in front of the ranks. Suddenly one shot after another rang out from the French, smoke appeared all along their uneven ranks, and musket shots sounded. Several of our men fell, among them the round-faced officer who had marched so gaily and complacently. But at the moment the first report was heard, Bagrati\u00f3n looked round and shouted, \u201cHurrah!\u201d\n\n\u201cHurrah\u2014ah!\u2014ah!\u201d rang a long-drawn shout from our ranks, and passing Bagrati\u00f3n and racing one another they rushed in an irregular but joyous and eager crowd down the hill at their disordered foe.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThe attack of the Sixth Chasseurs secured the retreat of our right flank. In the center T\u00fashin\u2019s forgotten battery, which had managed to set fire to the Sch\u00f6n Grabern village, delayed the French advance. The French were putting out the fire which the wind was spreading, and thus gave us time to retreat. The retirement of the center to the other side of the dip in the ground at the rear was hurried and noisy, but the different companies did not get mixed. But our left\u2014which consisted of the Az\u00f3v and Pod\u00f3lsk infantry and the P\u00e1vlograd hussars\u2014was simultaneously attacked and outflanked by superior French forces under Lannes and was thrown into confusion. Bagrati\u00f3n had sent Zherk\u00f3v to the general commanding that left flank with orders to retreat immediately.\n\nZherk\u00f3v, not removing his hand from his cap, turned his horse about and galloped off. But no sooner had he left Bagrati\u00f3n than his courage failed him. He was seized by panic and could not go where it was dangerous.\n\nHaving reached the left flank, instead of going to the front where the firing was, he began to look for the general and his staff where they could not possibly be, and so did not deliver the order.\n\nThe command of the left flank belonged by seniority to the commander of the regiment Kut\u00fazov had reviewed at Braunau and in which D\u00f3lokhov was serving as a private. But the command of the extreme left flank had been assigned to the commander of the P\u00e1vlograd regiment in which Rost\u00f3v was serving, and a misunderstanding arose. The two commanders were much exasperated with one another and, long after the action had begun on the right flank and the French were already advancing, were engaged in discussion with the sole object of offending one another. But the regiments, both cavalry and infantry, were by no means ready for the impending action. From privates to general they were not expecting a battle and were engaged in peaceful occupations, the cavalry feeding the horses and the infantry collecting wood.\n\n\u201cHe higher iss dan I in rank,\u201d said the German colonel of the hussars, flushing and addressing an adjutant who had ridden up, \u201cso let him do what he vill, but I cannot sacrifice my hussars... Bugler, sount ze retreat!\u201d\n\nBut haste was becoming imperative. Cannon and musketry, mingling together, thundered on the right and in the center, while the capotes of Lannes\u2019 sharpshooters were already seen crossing the milldam and forming up within twice the range of a musket shot. The general in command of the infantry went toward his horse with jerky steps, and having mounted drew himself up very straight and tall and rode to the P\u00e1vlograd commander. The commanders met with polite bows but with secret malevolence in their hearts.\n\n\u201cOnce again, Colonel,\u201d said the general, \u201cI can\u2019t leave half my men in the wood. I beg of you, I beg of you,\u201d he repeated, \u201cto occupy the position and prepare for an attack.\u201d\n\n\u201cI peg of you yourself not to mix in vot is not your business!\u201d suddenly replied the irate colonel. \u201cIf you vere in the cavalry...\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not in the cavalry, Colonel, but I am a Russian general and if you are not aware of the fact...\u201d\n\n\u201cQuite avare, your excellency,\u201d suddenly shouted the colonel, touching his horse and turning purple in the face. \u201cVill you be so goot to come to ze front and see dat zis position iss no goot? I don\u2019t vish to destroy my men for your pleasure!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou forget yourself, Colonel. I am not considering my own pleasure and I won\u2019t allow it to be said!\u201d\n\nTaking the colonel\u2019s outburst as a challenge to his courage, the general expanded his chest and rode, frowning, beside him to the front line, as if their differences would be settled there amongst the bullets. They reached the front, several bullets sped over them, and they halted in silence. There was nothing fresh to be seen from the line, for from where they had been before it had been evident that it was impossible for cavalry to act among the bushes and broken ground, as well as that the French were outflanking our left. The general and colonel looked sternly and significantly at one another like two fighting cocks preparing for battle, each vainly trying to detect signs of cowardice in the other. Both passed the examination successfully. As there was nothing to be said, and neither wished to give occasion for it to be alleged that he had been the first to leave the range of fire, they would have remained there for a long time testing each other\u2019s courage had it not been that just then they heard the rattle of musketry and a muffled shout almost behind them in the wood. The French had attacked the men collecting wood in the copse. It was no longer possible for the hussars to retreat with the infantry. They were cut off from the line of retreat on the left by the French. However inconvenient the position, it was now necessary to attack in order to cut a way through for themselves.\n\nThe squadron in which Rost\u00f3v was serving had scarcely time to mount before it was halted facing the enemy. Again, as at the Enns bridge, there was nothing between the squadron and the enemy, and again that terrible dividing line of uncertainty and fear\u2014resembling the line separating the living from the dead\u2014lay between them. All were conscious of this unseen line, and the question whether they would cross it or not, and how they would cross it, agitated them all.\n\nThe colonel rode to the front, angrily gave some reply to questions put to him by the officers, and, like a man desperately insisting on having his own way, gave an order. No one said anything definite, but the rumor of an attack spread through the squadron. The command to form up rang out and the sabers whizzed as they were drawn from their scabbards. Still no one moved. The troops of the left flank, infantry and hussars alike, felt that the commander did not himself know what to do, and this irresolution communicated itself to the men.\n\n\u201cIf only they would be quick!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, feeling that at last the time had come to experience the joy of an attack of which he had so often heard from his fellow hussars.\n\n\u201cFo\u2019ward, with God, lads!\u201d rang out Den\u00edsov\u2019s voice. \u201cAt a twot fo\u2019ward!\u201d\n\nThe horses\u2019 croups began to sway in the front line. Rook pulled at the reins and started of his own accord.\n\nBefore him, on the right, Rost\u00f3v saw the front lines of his hussars and still farther ahead a dark line which he could not see distinctly but took to be the enemy. Shots could be heard, but some way off.\n\n\u201cFaster!\u201d came the word of command, and Rost\u00f3v felt Rook\u2019s flanks drooping as he broke into a gallop.\n\nRost\u00f3v anticipated his horse\u2019s movements and became more and more elated. He had noticed a solitary tree ahead of him. This tree had been in the middle of the line that had seemed so terrible\u2014and now he had crossed that line and not only was there nothing terrible, but everything was becoming more and more happy and animated. \u201cOh, how I will slash at him!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, gripping the hilt of his saber.\n\n\u201cHur-a-a-a-ah!\u201d came a roar of voices. \u201cLet anyone come my way now,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v driving his spurs into Rook and letting him go at a full gallop so that he outstripped the others. Ahead, the enemy was already visible. Suddenly something like a birch broom seemed to sweep over the squadron. Rost\u00f3v raised his saber, ready to strike, but at that instant the trooper Nik\u00edtenko, who was galloping ahead, shot away from him, and Rost\u00f3v felt as in a dream that he continued to be carried forward with unnatural speed but yet stayed on the same spot. From behind him Bondarch\u00fak, an hussar he knew, jolted against him and looked angrily at him. Bondarch\u00fak\u2019s horse swerved and galloped past.\n\n\u201cHow is it I am not moving? I have fallen, I am killed!\u201d Rost\u00f3v asked and answered at the same instant. He was alone in the middle of a field. Instead of the moving horses and hussars\u2019 backs, he saw nothing before him but the motionless earth and the stubble around him. There was warm blood under his arm. \u201cNo, I am wounded and the horse is killed.\u201d Rook tried to rise on his forelegs but fell back, pinning his rider\u2019s leg. Blood was flowing from his head; he struggled but could not rise. Rost\u00f3v also tried to rise but fell back, his sabretache having become entangled in the saddle. Where our men were, and where the French, he did not know. There was no one near.\n\nHaving disentangled his leg, he rose. \u201cWhere, on which side, was now the line that had so sharply divided the two armies?\u201d he asked himself and could not answer. \u201cCan something bad have happened to me?\u201d he wondered as he got up: and at that moment he felt that something superfluous was hanging on his benumbed left arm. The wrist felt as if it were not his. He examined his hand carefully, vainly trying to find blood on it. \u201cAh, here are people coming,\u201d he thought joyfully, seeing some men running toward him. \u201cThey will help me!\u201d In front came a man wearing a strange shako and a blue cloak, swarthy, sunburned, and with a hooked nose. Then came two more, and many more running behind. One of them said something strange, not in Russian. In among the hindmost of these men wearing similar shakos was a Russian hussar. He was being held by the arms and his horse was being led behind him.\n\n\u201cIt must be one of ours, a prisoner. Yes. Can it be that they will take me too? Who are these men?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, scarcely believing his eyes. \u201cCan they be French?\u201d He looked at the approaching Frenchmen, and though but a moment before he had been galloping to get at them and hack them to pieces, their proximity now seemed so awful that he could not believe his eyes. \u201cWho are they? Why are they running? Can they be coming at me? And why? To kill me? Me whom everyone is so fond of?\u201d He remembered his mother\u2019s love for him, and his family\u2019s, and his friends\u2019, and the enemy\u2019s intention to kill him seemed impossible. \u201cBut perhaps they may do it!\u201d For more than ten seconds he stood not moving from the spot or realizing the situation. The foremost Frenchman, the one with the hooked nose, was already so close that the expression of his face could be seen. And the excited, alien face of that man, his bayonet hanging down, holding his breath, and running so lightly, frightened Rost\u00f3v. He seized his pistol and, instead of firing it, flung it at the Frenchman and ran with all his might toward the bushes. He did not now run with the feeling of doubt and conflict with which he had trodden the Enns bridge, but with the feeling of a hare fleeing from the hounds. One single sentiment, that of fear for his young and happy life, possessed his whole being. Rapidly leaping the furrows, he fled across the field with the impetuosity he used to show at catchplay, now and then turning his good-natured, pale, young face to look back. A shudder of terror went through him: \u201cNo, better not look,\u201d he thought, but having reached the bushes he glanced round once more. The French had fallen behind, and just as he looked round the first man changed his run to a walk and, turning, shouted something loudly to a comrade farther back. Rost\u00f3v paused. \u201cNo, there\u2019s some mistake,\u201d thought he. \u201cThey can\u2019t have wanted to kill me.\u201d But at the same time, his left arm felt as heavy as if a seventy-pound weight were tied to it. He could run no more. The Frenchman also stopped and took aim. Rost\u00f3v closed his eyes and stooped down. One bullet and then another whistled past him. He mustered his last remaining strength, took hold of his left hand with his right, and reached the bushes. Behind these were some Russian sharpshooters.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nThe infantry regiments that had been caught unawares in the outskirts of the wood ran out of it, the different companies getting mixed, and retreated as a disorderly crowd. One soldier, in his fear, uttered the senseless cry, \u201cCut off!\u201d that is so terrible in battle, and that word infected the whole crowd with a feeling of panic.\n\n\u201cSurrounded! Cut off? We\u2019re lost!\u201d shouted the fugitives.\n\nThe moment he heard the firing and the cry from behind, the general realized that something dreadful had happened to his regiment, and the thought that he, an exemplary officer of many years\u2019 service who had never been to blame, might be held responsible at headquarters for negligence or inefficiency so staggered him that, forgetting the recalcitrant cavalry colonel, his own dignity as a general, and above all quite forgetting the danger and all regard for self-preservation, he clutched the crupper of his saddle and, spurring his horse, galloped to the regiment under a hail of bullets which fell around, but fortunately missed him. His one desire was to know what was happening and at any cost correct, or remedy, the mistake if he had made one, so that he, an exemplary officer of twenty-two years\u2019 service, who had never been censured, should not be held to blame.\n\nHaving galloped safely through the French, he reached a field behind the copse across which our men, regardless of orders, were running and descending the valley. That moment of moral hesitation which decides the fate of battles had arrived. Would this disorderly crowd of soldiers attend to the voice of their commander, or would they, disregarding him, continue their flight? Despite his desperate shouts that used to seem so terrible to the soldiers, despite his furious purple countenance distorted out of all likeness to his former self, and the flourishing of his saber, the soldiers all continued to run, talking, firing into the air, and disobeying orders. The moral hesitation which decided the fate of battles was evidently culminating in a panic.\n\nThe general had a fit of coughing as a result of shouting and of the powder smoke and stopped in despair. Everything seemed lost. But at that moment the French who were attacking, suddenly and without any apparent reason, ran back and disappeared from the outskirts, and Russian sharpshooters showed themselves in the copse. It was Tim\u00f3khin\u2019s company, which alone had maintained its order in the wood and, having lain in ambush in a ditch, now attacked the French unexpectedly. Tim\u00f3khin, armed only with a sword, had rushed at the enemy with such a desperate cry and such mad, drunken determination that, taken by surprise, the French had thrown down their muskets and run. D\u00f3lokhov, running beside Tim\u00f3khin, killed a Frenchman at close quarters and was the first to seize the surrendering French officer by his collar. Our fugitives returned, the battalions re-formed, and the French who had nearly cut our left flank in half were for the moment repulsed. Our reserve units were able to join up, and the fight was at an end. The regimental commander and Major Ekon\u00f3mov had stopped beside a bridge, letting the retreating companies pass by them, when a soldier came up and took hold of the commander\u2019s stirrup, almost leaning against him. The man was wearing a bluish coat of broadcloth, he had no knapsack or cap, his head was bandaged, and over his shoulder a French munition pouch was slung. He had an officer\u2019s sword in his hand. The soldier was pale, his blue eyes looked impudently into the commander\u2019s face, and his lips were smiling. Though the commander was occupied in giving instructions to Major Ekon\u00f3mov, he could not help taking notice of the soldier.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, here are two trophies,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, pointing to the French sword and pouch. \u201cI have taken an officer prisoner. I stopped the company.\u201d D\u00f3lokhov breathed heavily from weariness and spoke in abrupt sentences. \u201cThe whole company can bear witness. I beg you will remember this, your excellency!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d replied the commander, and turned to Major Ekon\u00f3mov.\n\nBut D\u00f3lokhov did not go away; he untied the handkerchief around his head, pulled it off, and showed the blood congealed on his hair.\n\n\u201cA bayonet wound. I remained at the front. Remember, your excellency!\u201d\n\n\nT\u00fashin\u2019s battery had been forgotten and only at the very end of the action did Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, still hearing the cannonade in the center, send his orderly staff officer, and later Prince Andrew also, to order the battery to retire as quickly as possible. When the supports attached to T\u00fashin\u2019s battery had been moved away in the middle of the action by someone\u2019s order, the battery had continued firing and was only not captured by the French because the enemy could not surmise that anyone could have the effrontery to continue firing from four quite undefended guns. On the contrary, the energetic action of that battery led the French to suppose that here\u2014in the center\u2014the main Russian forces were concentrated. Twice they had attempted to attack this point, but on each occasion had been driven back by grapeshot from the four isolated guns on the hillock.\n\nSoon after Prince Bagrati\u00f3n had left him, T\u00fashin had succeeded in setting fire to Sch\u00f6n Grabern.\n\n\u201cLook at them scurrying! It\u2019s burning! Just see the smoke! Fine! Grand! Look at the smoke, the smoke!\u201d exclaimed the artillerymen, brightening up.\n\nAll the guns, without waiting for orders, were being fired in the direction of the conflagration. As if urging each other on, the soldiers cried at each shot: \u201cFine! That\u2019s good! Look at it... Grand!\u201d The fire, fanned by the breeze, was rapidly spreading. The French columns that had advanced beyond the village went back; but as though in revenge for this failure, the enemy placed ten guns to the right of the village and began firing them at T\u00fashin\u2019s battery.\n\nIn their childlike glee, aroused by the fire and their luck in successfully cannonading the French, our artillerymen only noticed this battery when two balls, and then four more, fell among our guns, one knocking over two horses and another tearing off a munition-wagon driver\u2019s leg. Their spirits once roused were, however, not diminished, but only changed character. The horses were replaced by others from a reserve gun carriage, the wounded were carried away, and the four guns were turned against the ten-gun battery. T\u00fashin\u2019s companion officer had been killed at the beginning of the engagement and within an hour seventeen of the forty men of the guns\u2019 crews had been disabled, but the artillerymen were still as merry and lively as ever. Twice they noticed the French appearing below them, and then they fired grapeshot at them.\n\nLittle T\u00fashin, moving feebly and awkwardly, kept telling his orderly to \u201crefill my pipe for that one!\u201d and then, scattering sparks from it, ran forward shading his eyes with his small hand to look at the French.\n\n\u201cSmack at \u2018em, lads!\u201d he kept saying, seizing the guns by the wheels and working the screws himself.\n\nAmid the smoke, deafened by the incessant reports which always made him jump, T\u00fashin not taking his pipe from his mouth ran from gun to gun, now aiming, now counting the charges, now giving orders about replacing dead or wounded horses and harnessing fresh ones, and shouting in his feeble voice, so high pitched and irresolute. His face grew more and more animated. Only when a man was killed or wounded did he frown and turn away from the sight, shouting angrily at the men who, as is always the case, hesitated about lifting the injured or dead. The soldiers, for the most part handsome fellows and, as is always the case in an artillery company, a head and shoulders taller and twice as broad as their officer\u2014all looked at their commander like children in an embarrassing situation, and the expression on his face was invariably reflected on theirs.\n\nOwing to the terrible uproar and the necessity for concentration and activity, T\u00fashin did not experience the slightest unpleasant sense of fear, and the thought that he might be killed or badly wounded never occurred to him. On the contrary, he became more and more elated. It seemed to him that it was a very long time ago, almost a day, since he had first seen the enemy and fired the first shot, and that the corner of the field he stood on was well-known and familiar ground. Though he thought of everything, considered everything, and did everything the best of officers could do in his position, he was in a state akin to feverish delirium or drunkenness.\n\nFrom the deafening sounds of his own guns around him, the whistle and thud of the enemy\u2019s cannon balls, from the flushed and perspiring faces of the crew bustling round the guns, from the sight of the blood of men and horses, from the little puffs of smoke on the enemy\u2019s side (always followed by a ball flying past and striking the earth, a man, a gun, a horse), from the sight of all these things a fantastic world of his own had taken possession of his brain and at that moment afforded him pleasure. The enemy\u2019s guns were in his fancy not guns but pipes from which occasional puffs were blown by an invisible smoker.\n\n\u201cThere... he\u2019s puffing again,\u201d muttered T\u00fashin to himself, as a small cloud rose from the hill and was borne in a streak to the left by the wind.\n\n\u201cNow look out for the ball... we\u2019ll throw it back.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, your honor?\u201d asked an artilleryman, standing close by, who heard him muttering.\n\n\u201cNothing... only a shell...\u201d he answered.\n\n\u201cCome along, our Matv\u00e9vna!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cMatv\u00e9vna\u201d was the name his fancy gave to the farthest gun of the battery, which was large and of an old pattern. The French swarming round their guns seemed to him like ants. In that world, the handsome drunkard Number One of the second gun\u2019s crew was \u201cuncle\u201d; T\u00fashin looked at him more often than at anyone else and took delight in his every movement. The sound of musketry at the foot of the hill, now diminishing, now increasing, seemed like someone\u2019s breathing. He listened intently to the ebb and flow of these sounds.\n\n\u201cAh! Breathing again, breathing!\u201d he muttered to himself.\n\nHe imagined himself as an enormously tall, powerful man who was throwing cannon balls at the French with both hands.\n\n\u201cNow then, Matv\u00e9vna, dear old lady, don\u2019t let me down!\u201d he was saying as he moved from the gun, when a strange, unfamiliar voice called above his head: \u201cCaptain T\u00fashin! Captain!\u201d\n\nT\u00fashin turned round in dismay. It was the staff officer who had turned him out of the booth at Grunth. He was shouting in a gasping voice:\n\n\u201cAre you mad? You have twice been ordered to retreat, and you...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are they down on me?\u201d thought T\u00fashin, looking in alarm at his superior.\n\n\u201cI... don\u2019t...\u201d he muttered, holding up two fingers to his cap. \u201cI...\u201d\n\nBut the staff officer did not finish what he wanted to say. A cannon ball, flying close to him, caused him to duck and bend over his horse. He paused, and just as he was about to say something more, another ball stopped him. He turned his horse and galloped off.\n\n\u201cRetire! All to retire!\u201d he shouted from a distance.\n\nThe soldiers laughed. A moment later, an adjutant arrived with the same order.\n\nIt was Prince Andrew. The first thing he saw on riding up to the space where T\u00fashin\u2019s guns were stationed was an unharnessed horse with a broken leg, that lay screaming piteously beside the harnessed horses. Blood was gushing from its leg as from a spring. Among the limbers lay several dead men. One ball after another passed over as he approached and he felt a nervous shudder run down his spine. But the mere thought of being afraid roused him again. \u201cI cannot be afraid,\u201d thought he, and dismounted slowly among the guns. He delivered the order and did not leave the battery. He decided to have the guns removed from their positions and withdrawn in his presence. Together with T\u00fashin, stepping across the bodies and under a terrible fire from the French, he attended to the removal of the guns.\n\n\u201cA staff officer was here a minute ago, but skipped off,\u201d said an artilleryman to Prince Andrew. \u201cNot like your honor!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew said nothing to T\u00fashin. They were both so busy as to seem not to notice one another. When having limbered up the only two cannon that remained uninjured out of the four, they began moving down the hill (one shattered gun and one unicorn were left behind), Prince Andrew rode up to T\u00fashin.\n\n\u201cWell, till we meet again...\u201d he said, holding out his hand to T\u00fashin.\n\n\u201cGood-by, my dear fellow,\u201d said T\u00fashin. \u201cDear soul! Good-by, my dear fellow!\u201d and for some unknown reason tears suddenly filled his eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe wind had fallen and black clouds, merging with the powder smoke, hung low over the field of battle on the horizon. It was growing dark and the glow of two conflagrations was the more conspicuous. The cannonade was dying down, but the rattle of musketry behind and on the right sounded oftener and nearer. As soon as T\u00fashin with his guns, continually driving round or coming upon wounded men, was out of range of fire and had descended into the dip, he was met by some of the staff, among them the staff officer and Zherk\u00f3v, who had been twice sent to T\u00fashin\u2019s battery but had never reached it. Interrupting one another, they all gave, and transmitted, orders as to how to proceed, reprimanding and reproaching him. T\u00fashin gave no orders, and, silently\u2014fearing to speak because at every word he felt ready to weep without knowing why\u2014rode behind on his artillery nag. Though the orders were to abandon the wounded, many of them dragged themselves after troops and begged for seats on the gun carriages. The jaunty infantry officer who just before the battle had rushed out of T\u00fashin\u2019s wattle shed was laid, with a bullet in his stomach, on \u201cMatv\u00e9vna\u2019s\u201d carriage. At the foot of the hill, a pale hussar cadet, supporting one hand with the other, came up to T\u00fashin and asked for a seat.\n\n\u201cCaptain, for God\u2019s sake! I\u2019ve hurt my arm,\u201d he said timidly. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake... I can\u2019t walk. For God\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\nIt was plain that this cadet had already repeatedly asked for a lift and been refused. He asked in a hesitating, piteous voice.\n\n\u201cTell them to give me a seat, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive him a seat,\u201d said T\u00fashin. \u201cLay a cloak for him to sit on, lad,\u201d he said, addressing his favorite soldier. \u201cAnd where is the wounded officer?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe has been set down. He died,\u201d replied someone.\n\n\u201cHelp him up. Sit down, dear fellow, sit down! Spread out the cloak, Ant\u00f3nov.\u201d\n\nThe cadet was Rost\u00f3v. With one hand he supported the other; he was pale and his jaw trembled, shivering feverishly. He was placed on \u201cMatv\u00e9vna,\u201d the gun from which they had removed the dead officer. The cloak they spread under him was wet with blood which stained his breeches and arm.\n\n\u201cWhat, are you wounded, my lad?\u201d said T\u00fashin, approaching the gun on which Rost\u00f3v sat.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s a sprain.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen what is this blood on the gun carriage?\u201d inquired T\u00fashin.\n\n\u201cIt was the officer, your honor, stained it,\u201d answered the artilleryman, wiping away the blood with his coat sleeve, as if apologizing for the state of his gun.\n\nIt was all that they could do to get the guns up the rise aided by the infantry, and having reached the village of Gruntersdorf they halted. It had grown so dark that one could not distinguish the uniforms ten paces off, and the firing had begun to subside. Suddenly, near by on the right, shouting and firing were again heard. Flashes of shot gleamed in the darkness. This was the last French attack and was met by soldiers who had sheltered in the village houses. They all rushed out of the village again, but T\u00fashin\u2019s guns could not move, and the artillerymen, T\u00fashin, and the cadet exchanged silent glances as they awaited their fate. The firing died down and soldiers, talking eagerly, streamed out of a side street.\n\n\u201cNot hurt, Petr\u00f3v?\u201d asked one.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve given it \u2018em hot, mate! They won\u2019t make another push now,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cYou couldn\u2019t see a thing. How they shot at their own fellows! Nothing could be seen. Pitch-dark, brother! Isn\u2019t there something to drink?\u201d\n\nThe French had been repulsed for the last time. And again and again in the complete darkness T\u00fashin\u2019s guns moved forward, surrounded by the humming infantry as by a frame.\n\nIn the darkness, it seemed as though a gloomy unseen river was flowing always in one direction, humming with whispers and talk and the sound of hoofs and wheels. Amid the general rumble, the groans and voices of the wounded were more distinctly heard than any other sound in the darkness of the night. The gloom that enveloped the army was filled with their groans, which seemed to melt into one with the darkness of the night. After a while the moving mass became agitated, someone rode past on a white horse followed by his suite, and said something in passing: \u201cWhat did he say? Where to, now? Halt, is it? Did he thank us?\u201d came eager questions from all sides. The whole moving mass began pressing closer together and a report spread that they were ordered to halt: evidently those in front had halted. All remained where they were in the middle of the muddy road.\n\nFires were lighted and the talk became more audible. Captain T\u00fashin, having given orders to his company, sent a soldier to find a dressing station or a doctor for the cadet, and sat down by a bonfire the soldiers had kindled on the road. Rost\u00f3v, too, dragged himself to the fire. From pain, cold, and damp, a feverish shivering shook his whole body. Drowsiness was irresistibly mastering him, but he kept awake by an excruciating pain in his arm, for which he could find no satisfactory position. He kept closing his eyes and then again looking at the fire, which seemed to him dazzlingly red, and at the feeble, round-shouldered figure of T\u00fashin who was sitting cross-legged like a Turk beside him. T\u00fashin\u2019s large, kind, intelligent eyes were fixed with sympathy and commiseration on Rost\u00f3v, who saw that T\u00fashin with his whole heart wished to help him but could not.\n\nFrom all sides were heard the footsteps and talk of the infantry, who were walking, driving past, and settling down all around. The sound of voices, the tramping feet, the horses\u2019 hoofs moving in mud, the crackling of wood fires near and afar, merged into one tremulous rumble.\n\nIt was no longer, as before, a dark, unseen river flowing through the gloom, but a dark sea swelling and gradually subsiding after a storm. Rost\u00f3v looked at and listened listlessly to what passed before and around him. An infantryman came to the fire, squatted on his heels, held his hands to the blaze, and turned away his face.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t mind your honor?\u201d he asked T\u00fashin. \u201cI\u2019ve lost my company, your honor. I don\u2019t know where... such bad luck!\u201d\n\nWith the soldier, an infantry officer with a bandaged cheek came up to the bonfire, and addressing T\u00fashin asked him to have the guns moved a trifle to let a wagon go past. After he had gone, two soldiers rushed to the campfire. They were quarreling and fighting desperately, each trying to snatch from the other a boot they were both holding on to.\n\n\u201cYou picked it up?... I dare say! You\u2019re very smart!\u201d one of them shouted hoarsely.\n\nThen a thin, pale soldier, his neck bandaged with a bloodstained leg band, came up and in angry tones asked the artillerymen for water.\n\n\u201cMust one die like a dog?\u201d said he.\n\nT\u00fashin told them to give the man some water. Then a cheerful soldier ran up, begging a little fire for the infantry.\n\n\u201cA nice little hot torch for the infantry! Good luck to you, fellow countrymen. Thanks for the fire\u2014we\u2019ll return it with interest,\u201d said he, carrying away into the darkness a glowing stick.\n\nNext came four soldiers, carrying something heavy on a cloak, and passed by the fire. One of them stumbled.\n\n\u201cWho the devil has put the logs on the road?\u201d snarled he.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s dead\u2014why carry him?\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cShut up!\u201d\n\nAnd they disappeared into the darkness with their load.\n\n\u201cStill aching?\u201d T\u00fashin asked Rost\u00f3v in a whisper.\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour honor, you\u2019re wanted by the general. He is in the hut here,\u201d said a gunner, coming up to T\u00fashin.\n\n\u201cComing, friend.\u201d\n\nT\u00fashin rose and, buttoning his greatcoat and pulling it straight, walked away from the fire.\n\nNot far from the artillery campfire, in a hut that had been prepared for him, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n sat at dinner, talking with some commanding officers who had gathered at his quarters. The little old man with the half-closed eyes was there greedily gnawing a mutton bone, and the general who had served blamelessly for twenty-two years, flushed by a glass of vodka and the dinner; and the staff officer with the signet ring, and Zherk\u00f3v, uneasily glancing at them all, and Prince Andrew, pale, with compressed lips and feverishly glittering eyes.\n\nIn a corner of the hut stood a standard captured from the French, and the accountant with the na\u00efve face was feeling its texture, shaking his head in perplexity\u2014perhaps because the banner really interested him, perhaps because it was hard for him, hungry as he was, to look on at a dinner where there was no place for him. In the next hut there was a French colonel who had been taken prisoner by our dragoons. Our officers were flocking in to look at him. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n was thanking the individual commanders and inquiring into details of the action and our losses. The general whose regiment had been inspected at Braunau was informing the prince that as soon as the action began he had withdrawn from the wood, mustered the men who were woodcutting, and, allowing the French to pass him, had made a bayonet charge with two battalions and had broken up the French troops.\n\n\u201cWhen I saw, your excellency, that their first battalion was disorganized, I stopped in the road and thought: \u2018I\u2019ll let them come on and will meet them with the fire of the whole battalion\u2019\u2014and that\u2019s what I did.\u201d\n\nThe general had so wished to do this and was so sorry he had not managed to do it that it seemed to him as if it had really happened. Perhaps it might really have been so? Could one possibly make out amid all that confusion what did or did not happen?\n\n\u201cBy the way, your excellency, I should inform you,\u201d he continued\u2014remembering D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s conversation with Kut\u00fazov and his last interview with the gentleman-ranker\u2014\u201cthat Private D\u00f3lokhov, who was reduced to the ranks, took a French officer prisoner in my presence and particularly distinguished himself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw the P\u00e1vlograd hussars attack there, your excellency,\u201d chimed in Zherk\u00f3v, looking uneasily around. He had not seen the hussars all that day, but had heard about them from an infantry officer. \u201cThey broke up two squares, your excellency.\u201d\n\nSeveral of those present smiled at Zherk\u00f3v\u2019s words, expecting one of his usual jokes, but noticing that what he was saying redounded to the glory of our arms and of the day\u2019s work, they assumed a serious expression, though many of them knew that what he was saying was a lie devoid of any foundation. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n turned to the old colonel:\n\n\u201cGentlemen, I thank you all; all arms have behaved heroically: infantry, cavalry, and artillery. How was it that two guns were abandoned in the center?\u201d he inquired, searching with his eyes for someone. (Prince Bagrati\u00f3n did not ask about the guns on the left flank; he knew that all the guns there had been abandoned at the very beginning of the action.) \u201cI think I sent you?\u201d he added, turning to the staff officer on duty.\n\n\u201cOne was damaged,\u201d answered the staff officer, \u201cand the other I can\u2019t understand. I was there all the time giving orders and had only just left.... It is true that it was hot there,\u201d he added, modestly.\n\nSomeone mentioned that Captain T\u00fashin was bivouacking close to the village and had already been sent for.\n\n\u201cOh, but you were there?\u201d said Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, addressing Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cOf course, we only just missed one another,\u201d said the staff officer, with a smile to Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cI had not the pleasure of seeing you,\u201d said Prince Andrew, coldly and abruptly.\n\nAll were silent. T\u00fashin appeared at the threshold and made his way timidly from behind the backs of the generals. As he stepped past the generals in the crowded hut, feeling embarrassed as he always was by the sight of his superiors, he did not notice the staff of the banner and stumbled over it. Several of those present laughed.\n\n\u201cHow was it a gun was abandoned?\u201d asked Bagrati\u00f3n, frowning, not so much at the captain as at those who were laughing, among whom Zherk\u00f3v laughed loudest.\n\nOnly now, when he was confronted by the stern authorities, did his guilt and the disgrace of having lost two guns and yet remaining alive present themselves to T\u00fashin in all their horror. He had been so excited that he had not thought about it until that moment. The officers\u2019 laughter confused him still more. He stood before Bagrati\u00f3n with his lower jaw trembling and was hardly able to mutter: \u201cI don\u2019t know... your excellency... I had no men... your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou might have taken some from the covering troops.\u201d\n\nT\u00fashin did not say that there were no covering troops, though that was perfectly true. He was afraid of getting some other officer into trouble, and silently fixed his eyes on Bagrati\u00f3n as a schoolboy who has blundered looks at an examiner.\n\nThe silence lasted some time. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, apparently not wishing to be severe, found nothing to say; the others did not venture to intervene. Prince Andrew looked at T\u00fashin from under his brows and his fingers twitched nervously.\n\n\u201cYour excellency!\u201d Prince Andrew broke the silence with his abrupt voice, \u201cyou were pleased to send me to Captain T\u00fashin\u2019s battery. I went there and found two thirds of the men and horses knocked out, two guns smashed, and no supports at all.\u201d\n\nPrince Bagrati\u00f3n and T\u00fashin looked with equal intentness at Bolk\u00f3nski, who spoke with suppressed agitation.\n\n\u201cAnd, if your excellency will allow me to express my opinion,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe owe today\u2019s success chiefly to the action of that battery and the heroic endurance of Captain T\u00fashin and his company,\u201d and without awaiting a reply, Prince Andrew rose and left th", "sequence": 4}, {"offset": 500000, "text": "e table.\n\nPrince Bagrati\u00f3n looked at T\u00fashin, evidently reluctant to show distrust in Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s emphatic opinion yet not feeling able fully to credit it, bent his head, and told T\u00fashin that he could go. Prince Andrew went out with him.\n\n\u201cThank you; you saved me, my dear fellow!\u201d said T\u00fashin.\n\nPrince Andrew gave him a look, but said nothing and went away. He felt sad and depressed. It was all so strange, so unlike what he had hoped.\n\n\n\u201cWho are they? Why are they here? What do they want? And when will all this end?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, looking at the changing shadows before him. The pain in his arm became more and more intense. Irresistible drowsiness overpowered him, red rings danced before his eyes, and the impression of those voices and faces and a sense of loneliness merged with the physical pain. It was they, these soldiers\u2014wounded and unwounded\u2014it was they who were crushing, weighing down, and twisting the sinews and scorching the flesh of his sprained arm and shoulder. To rid himself of them he closed his eyes.\n\nFor a moment he dozed, but in that short interval innumerable things appeared to him in a dream: his mother and her large white hand, S\u00f3nya\u2019s thin little shoulders, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s eyes and laughter, Den\u00edsov with his voice and mustache, and Tely\u00e1nin and all that affair with Tely\u00e1nin and Bogd\u00e1nich. That affair was the same thing as this soldier with the harsh voice, and it was that affair and this soldier that were so agonizingly, incessantly pulling and pressing his arm and always dragging it in one direction. He tried to get away from them, but they would not for an instant let his shoulder move a hair\u2019s breadth. It would not ache\u2014it would be well\u2014if only they did not pull it, but it was impossible to get rid of them.\n\nHe opened his eyes and looked up. The black canopy of night hung less than a yard above the glow of the charcoal. Flakes of falling snow were fluttering in that light. T\u00fashin had not returned, the doctor had not come. He was alone now, except for a soldier who was sitting naked at the other side of the fire, warming his thin yellow body.\n\n\u201cNobody wants me!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cThere is no one to help me or pity me. Yet I was once at home, strong, happy, and loved.\u201d He sighed and, doing so, groaned involuntarily.\n\n\u201cEh, is anything hurting you?\u201d asked the soldier, shaking his shirt out over the fire, and not waiting for an answer he gave a grunt and added: \u201cWhat a lot of men have been crippled today\u2014frightful!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v did not listen to the soldier. He looked at the snowflakes fluttering above the fire and remembered a Russian winter at his warm, bright home, his fluffy fur coat, his quickly gliding sleigh, his healthy body, and all the affection and care of his family. \u201cAnd why did I come here?\u201d he wondered.\n\nNext day the French army did not renew their attack, and the remnant of Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s detachment was reunited to Kut\u00fazov\u2019s army.\n\n\n\nBOOK THREE: 1805\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli was not a man who deliberately thought out his plans. Still less did he think of injuring anyone for his own advantage. He was merely a man of the world who had got on and to whom getting on had become a habit. Schemes and devices for which he never rightly accounted to himself, but which formed the whole interest of his life, were constantly shaping themselves in his mind, arising from the circumstances and persons he met. Of these plans he had not merely one or two in his head but dozens, some only beginning to form themselves, some approaching achievement, and some in course of disintegration. He did not, for instance, say to himself: \u201cThis man now has influence, I must gain his confidence and friendship and through him obtain a special grant.\u201d Nor did he say to himself: \u201cPierre is a rich man, I must entice him to marry my daughter and lend me the forty thousand rubles I need.\u201d But when he came across a man of position his instinct immediately told him that this man could be useful, and without any premeditation Prince Vas\u00edli took the first opportunity to gain his confidence, flatter him, become intimate with him, and finally make his request.\n\nHe had Pierre at hand in Moscow and procured for him an appointment as Gentleman of the Bedchamber, which at that time conferred the status of Councilor of State, and insisted on the young man accompanying him to Petersburg and staying at his house. With apparent absent-mindedness, yet with unhesitating assurance that he was doing the right thing, Prince Vas\u00edli did everything to get Pierre to marry his daughter. Had he thought out his plans beforehand he could not have been so natural and shown such unaffected familiarity in intercourse with everybody both above and below him in social standing. Something always drew him toward those richer and more powerful than himself and he had rare skill in seizing the most opportune moment for making use of people.\n\nPierre, on unexpectedly becoming Count Bez\u00fakhov and a rich man, felt himself after his recent loneliness and freedom from cares so beset and preoccupied that only in bed was he able to be by himself. He had to sign papers, to present himself at government offices, the purpose of which was not clear to him, to question his chief steward, to visit his estate near Moscow, and to receive many people who formerly did not even wish to know of his existence but would now have been offended and grieved had he chosen not to see them. These different people\u2014businessmen, relations, and acquaintances alike\u2014were all disposed to treat the young heir in the most friendly and flattering manner: they were all evidently firmly convinced of Pierre\u2019s noble qualities. He was always hearing such words as: \u201cWith your remarkable kindness,\u201d or, \u201cWith your excellent heart,\u201d \u201cYou are yourself so honorable, Count,\u201d or, \u201cWere he as clever as you,\u201d and so on, till he began sincerely to believe in his own exceptional kindness and extraordinary intelligence, the more so as in the depth of his heart it had always seemed to him that he really was very kind and intelligent. Even people who had formerly been spiteful toward him and evidently unfriendly now became gentle and affectionate. The angry eldest princess, with the long waist and hair plastered down like a doll\u2019s, had come into Pierre\u2019s room after the funeral. With drooping eyes and frequent blushes she told him she was very sorry about their past misunderstandings and did not now feel she had a right to ask him for anything, except only for permission, after the blow she had received, to remain for a few weeks longer in the house she so loved and where she had sacrificed so much. She could not refrain from weeping at these words. Touched that this statuesque princess could so change, Pierre took her hand and begged her forgiveness, without knowing what for. From that day the eldest princess quite changed toward Pierre and began knitting a striped scarf for him.\n\n\u201cDo this for my sake, mon cher; after all, she had to put up with a great deal from the deceased,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to him, handing him a deed to sign for the princess\u2019 benefit.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli had come to the conclusion that it was necessary to throw this bone\u2014a bill for thirty thousand rubles\u2014to the poor princess that it might not occur to her to speak of his share in the affair of the inlaid portfolio. Pierre signed the deed and after that the princess grew still kinder. The younger sisters also became affectionate to him, especially the youngest, the pretty one with the mole, who often made him feel confused by her smiles and her own confusion when meeting him.\n\nIt seemed so natural to Pierre that everyone should like him, and it would have seemed so unnatural had anyone disliked him, that he could not but believe in the sincerity of those around him. Besides, he had no time to ask himself whether these people were sincere or not. He was always busy and always felt in a state of mild and cheerful intoxication. He felt as though he were the center of some important and general movement; that something was constantly expected of him, that if he did not do it he would grieve and disappoint many people, but if he did this and that, all would be well; and he did what was demanded of him, but still that happy result always remained in the future.\n\nMore than anyone else, Prince Vas\u00edli took possession of Pierre\u2019s affairs and of Pierre himself in those early days. From the death of Count Bez\u00fakhov he did not let go his hold of the lad. He had the air of a man oppressed by business, weary and suffering, who yet would not, for pity\u2019s sake, leave this helpless youth who, after all, was the son of his old friend and the possessor of such enormous wealth, to the caprice of fate and the designs of rogues. During the few days he spent in Moscow after the death of Count Bez\u00fakhov, he would call Pierre, or go to him himself, and tell him what ought to be done in a tone of weariness and assurance, as if he were adding every time: \u201cYou know I am overwhelmed with business and it is purely out of charity that I trouble myself about you, and you also know quite well that what I propose is the only thing possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my dear fellow, tomorrow we are off at last,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli one day, closing his eyes and fingering Pierre\u2019s elbow, speaking as if he were saying something which had long since been agreed upon and could not now be altered. \u201cWe start tomorrow and I\u2019m giving you a place in my carriage. I am very glad. All our important business here is now settled, and I ought to have been off long ago. Here is something I have received from the chancellor. I asked him for you, and you have been entered in the diplomatic corps and made a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. The diplomatic career now lies open before you.\u201d\n\nNotwithstanding the tone of wearied assurance with which these words were pronounced, Pierre, who had so long been considering his career, wished to make some suggestion. But Prince Vas\u00edli interrupted him in the special deep cooing tone, precluding the possibility of interrupting his speech, which he used in extreme cases when special persuasion was needed.\n\n\u201cMais, mon cher, I did this for my own sake, to satisfy my conscience, and there is nothing to thank me for. No one has ever complained yet of being too much loved; and besides, you are free, you could throw it up tomorrow. But you will see everything for yourself when you get to Petersburg. It is high time for you to get away from these terrible recollections.\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli sighed. \u201cYes, yes, my boy. And my valet can go in your carriage. Ah! I was nearly forgetting,\u201d he added. \u201cYou know, mon cher, your father and I had some accounts to settle, so I have received what was due from the Ryaz\u00e1n estate and will keep it; you won\u2019t require it. We\u2019ll go into the accounts later.\u201d\n\nBy \u201cwhat was due from the Ryaz\u00e1n estate\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli meant several thousand rubles quitrent received from Pierre\u2019s peasants, which the prince had retained for himself.\n\nIn Petersburg, as in Moscow, Pierre found the same atmosphere of gentleness and affection. He could not refuse the post, or rather the rank (for he did nothing), that Prince Vas\u00edli had procured for him, and acquaintances, invitations, and social occupations were so numerous that, even more than in Moscow, he felt a sense of bewilderment, bustle, and continual expectation of some good, always in front of him but never attained.\n\nOf his former bachelor acquaintances many were no longer in Petersburg. The Guards had gone to the front; D\u00f3lokhov had been reduced to the ranks; Anatole was in the army somewhere in the provinces; Prince Andrew was abroad; so Pierre had not the opportunity to spend his nights as he used to like to spend them, or to open his mind by intimate talks with a friend older than himself and whom he respected. His whole time was taken up with dinners and balls and was spent chiefly at Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s house in the company of the stout princess, his wife, and his beautiful daughter H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nLike the others, Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer showed Pierre the change of attitude toward him that had taken place in society.\n\nFormerly in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s presence, Pierre had always felt that what he was saying was out of place, tactless and unsuitable, that remarks which seemed to him clever while they formed in his mind became foolish as soon as he uttered them, while on the contrary Hippolyte\u2019s stupidest remarks came out clever and apt. Now everything Pierre said was charmant. Even if Anna P\u00e1vlovna did not say so, he could see that she wished to and only refrained out of regard for his modesty.\n\nIn the beginning of the winter of 1805-6 Pierre received one of Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s usual pink notes with an invitation to which was added: \u201cYou will find the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne here, whom it is always delightful to see.\u201d\n\nWhen he read that sentence, Pierre felt for the first time that some link which other people recognized had grown up between himself and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and that thought both alarmed him, as if some obligation were being imposed on him which he could not fulfill, and pleased him as an entertaining supposition.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s \u201cAt Home\u201d was like the former one, only the novelty she offered her guests this time was not Mortemart, but a diplomatist fresh from Berlin with the very latest details of the Emperor Alexander\u2019s visit to Potsdam, and of how the two august friends had pledged themselves in an indissoluble alliance to uphold the cause of justice against the enemy of the human race. Anna P\u00e1vlovna received Pierre with a shade of melancholy, evidently relating to the young man\u2019s recent loss by the death of Count Bez\u00fakhov (everyone constantly considered it a duty to assure Pierre that he was greatly afflicted by the death of the father he had hardly known), and her melancholy was just like the august melancholy she showed at the mention of her most august Majesty the Empress M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna. Pierre felt flattered by this. Anna P\u00e1vlovna arranged the different groups in her drawing room with her habitual skill. The large group, in which were Prince Vas\u00edli and the generals, had the benefit of the diplomat. Another group was at the tea table. Pierre wished to join the former, but Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2014who was in the excited condition of a commander on a battlefield to whom thousands of new and brilliant ideas occur which there is hardly time to put in action\u2014seeing Pierre, touched his sleeve with her finger, saying:\n\n\u201cWait a bit, I have something in view for you this evening.\u201d (She glanced at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and smiled at her.) \u201cMy dear H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, be charitable to my poor aunt who adores you. Go and keep her company for ten minutes. And that it will not be too dull, here is the dear count who will not refuse to accompany you.\u201d\n\nThe beauty went to the aunt, but Anna P\u00e1vlovna detained Pierre, looking as if she had to give some final necessary instructions.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she exquisite?\u201d she said to Pierre, pointing to the stately beauty as she glided away. \u201cAnd how she carries herself! For so young a girl, such tact, such masterly perfection of manner! It comes from her heart. Happy the man who wins her! With her the least worldly of men would occupy a most brilliant position in society. Don\u2019t you think so? I only wanted to know your opinion,\u201d and Anna P\u00e1vlovna let Pierre go.\n\nPierre, in reply, sincerely agreed with her as to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s perfection of manner. If he ever thought of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, it was just of her beauty and her remarkable skill in appearing silently dignified in society.\n\nThe old aunt received the two young people in her corner, but seemed desirous of hiding her adoration for H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and inclined rather to show her fear of Anna P\u00e1vlovna. She looked at her niece, as if inquiring what she was to do with these people. On leaving them, Anna P\u00e1vlovna again touched Pierre\u2019s sleeve, saying: \u201cI hope you won\u2019t say that it is dull in my house again,\u201d and she glanced at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne smiled, with a look implying that she did not admit the possibility of anyone seeing her without being enchanted. The aunt coughed, swallowed, and said in French that she was very pleased to see H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, then she turned to Pierre with the same words of welcome and the same look. In the middle of a dull and halting conversation, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne turned to Pierre with the beautiful bright smile that she gave to everyone. Pierre was so used to that smile, and it had so little meaning for him, that he paid no attention to it. The aunt was just speaking of a collection of snuffboxes that had belonged to Pierre\u2019s father, Count Bez\u00fakhov, and showed them her own box. Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne asked to see the portrait of the aunt\u2019s husband on the box lid.\n\n\u201cThat is probably the work of Vinesse,\u201d said Pierre, mentioning a celebrated miniaturist, and he leaned over the table to take the snuffbox while trying to hear what was being said at the other table.\n\nHe half rose, meaning to go round, but the aunt handed him the snuffbox, passing it across H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s back. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne stooped forward to make room, and looked round with a smile. She was, as always at evening parties, wearing a dress such as was then fashionable, cut very low at front and back. Her bust, which had always seemed like marble to Pierre, was so close to him that his shortsighted eyes could not but perceive the living charm of her neck and shoulders, so near to his lips that he need only have bent his head a little to have touched them. He was conscious of the warmth of her body, the scent of perfume, and the creaking of her corset as she moved. He did not see her marble beauty forming a complete whole with her dress, but all the charm of her body only covered by her garments. And having once seen this he could not help being aware of it, just as we cannot renew an illusion we have once seen through.\n\n\u201cSo you have never noticed before how beautiful I am?\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne seemed to say. \u201cYou had not noticed that I am a woman? Yes, I am a woman who may belong to anyone\u2014to you too,\u201d said her glance. And at that moment Pierre felt that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne not only could, but must, be his wife, and that it could not be otherwise.\n\nHe knew this at that moment as surely as if he had been standing at the altar with her. How and when this would be he did not know, he did not even know if it would be a good thing (he even felt, he knew not why, that it would be a bad thing), but he knew it would happen.\n\nPierre dropped his eyes, lifted them again, and wished once more to see her as a distant beauty far removed from him, as he had seen her every day until then, but he could no longer do it. He could not, any more than a man who has been looking at a tuft of steppe grass through the mist and taking it for a tree can again take it for a tree after he has once recognized it to be a tuft of grass. She was terribly close to him. She already had power over him, and between them there was no longer any barrier except the barrier of his own will.\n\n\u201cWell, I will leave you in your little corner,\u201d came Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s voice, \u201cI see you are all right there.\u201d\n\nAnd Pierre, anxiously trying to remember whether he had done anything reprehensible, looked round with a blush. It seemed to him that everyone knew what had happened to him as he knew it himself.\n\nA little later when he went up to the large circle, Anna P\u00e1vlovna said to him: \u201cI hear you are refitting your Petersburg house?\u201d\n\nThis was true. The architect had told him that it was necessary, and Pierre, without knowing why, was having his enormous Petersburg house done up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a good thing, but don\u2019t move from Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s. It is good to have a friend like the prince,\u201d she said, smiling at Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cI know something about that. Don\u2019t I? And you are still so young. You need advice. Don\u2019t be angry with me for exercising an old woman\u2019s privilege.\u201d\n\nShe paused, as women always do, expecting something after they have mentioned their age. \u201cIf you marry it will be a different thing,\u201d she continued, uniting them both in one glance. Pierre did not look at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne nor she at him. But she was just as terribly close to him. He muttered something and colored.\n\nWhen he got home he could not sleep for a long time for thinking of what had happened. What had happened? Nothing. He had merely understood that the woman he had known as a child, of whom when her beauty was mentioned he had said absent-mindedly: \u201cYes, she\u2019s good looking,\u201d he had understood that this woman might belong to him.\n\n\u201cBut she\u2019s stupid. I have myself said she is stupid,\u201d he thought. \u201cThere is something nasty, something wrong, in the feeling she excites in me. I have been told that her brother Anatole was in love with her and she with him, that there was quite a scandal and that that\u2019s why he was sent away. Hippolyte is her brother... Prince Vas\u00edli is her father... It\u2019s bad....\u201d he reflected, but while he was thinking this (the reflection was still incomplete), he caught himself smiling and was conscious that another line of thought had sprung up, and while thinking of her worthlessness he was also dreaming of how she would be his wife, how she would love him become quite different, and how all he had thought and heard of her might be false. And he again saw her not as the daughter of Prince Vas\u00edli, but visualized her whole body only veiled by its gray dress. \u201cBut no! Why did this thought never occur to me before?\u201d and again he told himself that it was impossible, that there would be something unnatural, and as it seemed to him dishonorable, in this marriage. He recalled her former words and looks and the words and looks of those who had seen them together. He recalled Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s words and looks when she spoke to him about his house, recalled thousands of such hints from Prince Vas\u00edli and others, and was seized by terror lest he had already, in some way, bound himself to do something that was evidently wrong and that he ought not to do. But at the very time he was expressing this conviction to himself, in another part of his mind her image rose in all its womanly beauty.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIn November, 1805, Prince Vas\u00edli had to go on a tour of inspection in four different provinces. He had arranged this for himself so as to visit his neglected estates at the same time and pick up his son Anatole where his regiment was stationed, and take him to visit Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski in order to arrange a match for him with the daughter of that rich old man. But before leaving home and undertaking these new affairs, Prince Vas\u00edli had to settle matters with Pierre, who, it is true, had latterly spent whole days at home, that is, in Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s house where he was staying, and had been absurd, excited, and foolish in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s presence (as a lover should be), but had not yet proposed to her.\n\n\u201cThis is all very fine, but things must be settled,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli to himself, with a sorrowful sigh, one morning, feeling that Pierre who was under such obligations to him (\u201cBut never mind that\u201d) was not behaving very well in this matter. \u201cYouth, frivolity... well, God be with him,\u201d thought he, relishing his own goodness of heart, \u201cbut it must be brought to a head. The day after tomorrow will be L\u00eblya\u2019s name day. I will invite two or three people, and if he does not understand what he ought to do then it will be my affair\u2014yes, my affair. I am her father.\u201d\n\nSix weeks after Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s \u201cAt Home\u201d and after the sleepless night when he had decided that to marry H\u00e9l\u00e8ne would be a calamity and that he ought to avoid her and go away, Pierre, despite that decision, had not left Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s and felt with terror that in people\u2019s eyes he was every day more and more connected with her, that it was impossible for him to return to his former conception of her, that he could not break away from her, and that though it would be a terrible thing he would have to unite his fate with hers. He might perhaps have been able to free himself but that Prince Vas\u00edli (who had rarely before given receptions) now hardly let a day go by without having an evening party at which Pierre had to be present unless he wished to spoil the general pleasure and disappoint everyone\u2019s expectation. Prince Vas\u00edli, in the rare moments when he was at home, would take Pierre\u2019s hand in passing and draw it downwards, or absent-mindedly hold out his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek for Pierre to kiss and would say: \u201cTill tomorrow,\u201d or, \u201cBe in to dinner or I shall not see you,\u201d or, \u201cI am staying in for your sake,\u201d and so on. And though Prince Vas\u00edli, when he stayed in (as he said) for Pierre\u2019s sake, hardly exchanged a couple of words with him, Pierre felt unable to disappoint him. Every day he said to himself one and the same thing: \u201cIt is time I understood her and made up my mind what she really is. Was I mistaken before, or am I mistaken now? No, she is not stupid, she is an excellent girl,\u201d he sometimes said to himself \u201cshe never makes a mistake, never says anything stupid. She says little, but what she does say is always clear and simple, so she is not stupid. She never was abashed and is not abashed now, so she cannot be a bad woman!\u201d He had often begun to make reflections or think aloud in her company, and she had always answered him either by a brief but appropriate remark\u2014showing that it did not interest her\u2014or by a silent look and smile which more palpably than anything else showed Pierre her superiority. She was right in regarding all arguments as nonsense in comparison with that smile.\n\nShe always addressed him with a radiantly confiding smile meant for him alone, in which there was something more significant than in the general smile that usually brightened her face. Pierre knew that everyone was waiting for him to say a word and cross a certain line, and he knew that sooner or later he would step across it, but an incomprehensible terror seized him at the thought of that dreadful step. A thousand times during that month and a half while he felt himself drawn nearer and nearer to that dreadful abyss, Pierre said to himself: \u201cWhat am I doing? I need resolution. Can it be that I have none?\u201d\n\nHe wished to take a decision, but felt with dismay that in this matter he lacked that strength of will which he had known in himself and really possessed. Pierre was one of those who are only strong when they feel themselves quite innocent, and since that day when he was overpowered by a feeling of desire while stooping over the snuffbox at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s, an unacknowledged sense of the guilt of that desire paralyzed his will.\n\nOn H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s name day, a small party of just their own people\u2014as his wife said\u2014met for supper at Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s. All these friends and relations had been given to understand that the fate of the young girl would be decided that evening. The visitors were seated at supper. Princess Kur\u00e1gina, a portly imposing woman who had once been handsome, was sitting at the head of the table. On either side of her sat the more important guests\u2014an old general and his wife, and Anna P\u00e1vlovna Sch\u00e9rer. At the other end sat the younger and less important guests, and there too sat the members of the family, and Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, side by side. Prince Vas\u00edli was not having any supper: he went round the table in a merry mood, sitting down now by one, now by another, of the guests. To each of them he made some careless and agreeable remark except to Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, whose presence he seemed not to notice. He enlivened the whole party. The wax candles burned brightly, the silver and crystal gleamed, so did the ladies\u2019 toilets and the gold and silver of the men\u2019s epaulets; servants in scarlet liveries moved round the table, the clatter of plates, knives, and glasses mingled with the animated hum of several conversations. At one end of the table, the old chamberlain was heard assuring an old baroness that he loved her passionately, at which she laughed; at the other could be heard the story of the misfortunes of some Mary V\u00edktorovna or other. At the center of the table, Prince Vas\u00edli attracted everybody\u2019s attention. With a facetious smile on his face, he was telling the ladies about last Wednesday\u2019s meeting of the Imperial Council, at which Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch Vyazm\u00edtinov, the new military governor general of Petersburg, had received and read the then famous rescript of the Emperor Alexander from the army to Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch, in which the Emperor said that he was receiving from all sides declarations of the people\u2019s loyalty, that the declaration from Petersburg gave him particular pleasure, and that he was proud to be at the head of such a nation and would endeavor to be worthy of it. This rescript began with the words: \u201cSerg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch, From all sides reports reach me,\u201d etc.\n\n\u201cWell, and so he never got farther than: \u2018Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch\u2019?\u201d asked one of the ladies.\n\n\u201cExactly, not a hair\u2019s breadth farther,\u201d answered Prince Vas\u00edli, laughing, \u201c\u2018Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch... From all sides... From all sides... Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch...\u2019 Poor Vyazm\u00edtinov could not get any farther! He began the rescript again and again, but as soon as he uttered \u2018Serg\u00e9y\u2019 he sobbed, \u2018Kuz-m\u00ed-ch,\u2019 tears, and \u2018From all sides\u2019 was smothered in sobs and he could get no farther. And again his handkerchief, and again: \u2018Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch, From all sides,\u2019... and tears, till at last somebody else was asked to read it.\u201d\n\n\u201cKuzm\u00edch... From all sides... and then tears,\u201d someone repeated laughing.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t be unkind,\u201d cried Anna P\u00e1vlovna from her end of the table holding up a threatening finger. \u201cHe is such a worthy and excellent man, our dear Vyazm\u00edtinov....\u201d\n\nEverybody laughed a great deal. At the head of the table, where the honored guests sat, everyone seemed to be in high spirits and under the influence of a variety of exciting sensations. Only Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne sat silently side by side almost at the bottom of the table, a suppressed smile brightening both their faces, a smile that had nothing to do with Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch\u2014a smile of bashfulness at their own feelings. But much as all the rest laughed, talked, and joked, much as they enjoyed their Rhine wine, saut\u00e9, and ices, and however they avoided looking at the young couple, and heedless and unobservant as they seemed of them, one could feel by the occasional glances they gave that the story about Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch, the laughter, and the food were all a pretense, and that the whole attention of that company was directed to\u2014Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Prince Vas\u00edli mimicked the sobbing of Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch and at the same time his eyes glanced toward his daughter, and while he laughed the expression on his face clearly said: \u201cYes... it\u2019s getting on, it will all be settled today.\u201d Anna P\u00e1vlovna threatened him on behalf of \u201cour dear Vyazm\u00edtinov,\u201d and in her eyes, which, for an instant, glanced at Pierre, Prince Vas\u00edli read a congratulation on his future son-in-law and on his daughter\u2019s happiness. The old princess sighed sadly as she offered some wine to the old lady next to her and glanced angrily at her daughter, and her sigh seemed to say: \u201cYes, there\u2019s nothing left for you and me but to sip sweet wine, my dear, now that the time has come for these young ones to be thus boldly, provocatively happy.\u201d \u201cAnd what nonsense all this is that I am saying!\u201d thought a diplomatist, glancing at the happy faces of the lovers. \u201cThat\u2019s happiness!\u201d\n\nInto the insignificant, trifling, and artificial interests uniting that society had entered the simple feeling of the attraction of a healthy and handsome young man and woman for one another. And this human feeling dominated everything else and soared above all their affected chatter. Jests fell flat, news was not interesting, and the animation was evidently forced. Not only the guests but even the footmen waiting at table seemed to feel this, and they forgot their duties as they looked at the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne with her radiant face and at the red, broad, and happy though uneasy face of Pierre. It seemed as if the very light of the candles was focused on those two happy faces alone.\n\nPierre felt that he was the center of it all, and this both pleased and embarrassed him. He was like a man entirely absorbed in some occupation. He did not see, hear, or understand anything clearly. Only now and then detached ideas and impressions from the world of reality shot unexpectedly through his mind.\n\n\u201cSo it is all finished!\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd how has it all happened? How quickly! Now I know that not because of her alone, nor of myself alone, but because of everyone, it must inevitably come about. They are all expecting it, they are so sure that it will happen that I cannot, I cannot, disappoint them. But how will it be? I do not know, but it will certainly happen!\u201d thought Pierre, glancing at those dazzling shoulders close to his eyes.\n\nOr he would suddenly feel ashamed of he knew not what. He felt it awkward to attract everyone\u2019s attention and to be considered a lucky man and, with his plain face, to be looked on as a sort of Paris possessed of a Helen. \u201cBut no doubt it always is and must be so!\u201d he consoled himself. \u201cAnd besides, what have I done to bring it about? How did it begin? I traveled from Moscow with Prince Vas\u00edli. Then there was nothing. So why should I not stay at his house? Then I played cards with her and picked up her reticule and drove out with her. How did it begin, when did it all come about?\u201d And here he was sitting by her side as her betrothed, seeing, hearing, feeling her nearness, her breathing, her movements, her beauty. Then it would suddenly seem to him that it was not she but he was so unusually beautiful, and that that was why they all looked so at him, and flattered by this general admiration he would expand his chest, raise his head, and rejoice at his good fortune. Suddenly he heard a familiar voice repeating something to him a second time. But Pierre was so absorbed that he did not understand what was said.\n\n\u201cI am asking you when you last heard from Bolk\u00f3nski,\u201d repeated Prince Vas\u00edli a third time. \u201cHow absent-minded you are, my dear fellow.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli smiled, and Pierre noticed that everyone was smiling at him and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cWell, what of it, if you all know it?\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cWhat of it? It\u2019s the truth!\u201d and he himself smiled his gentle childlike smile, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne smiled too.\n\n\u201cWhen did you get the letter? Was it from Olm\u00fctz?\u201d repeated Prince Vas\u00edli, who pretended to want to know this in order to settle a dispute.\n\n\u201cHow can one talk or think of such trifles?\u201d thought Pierre.\n\n\u201cYes, from Olm\u00fctz,\u201d he answered, with a sigh.\n\nAfter supper Pierre with his partner followed the others into the drawing room. The guests began to disperse, some without taking leave of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Some, as if unwilling to distract her from an important occupation, came up to her for a moment and made haste to go away, refusing to let her see them off. The diplomatist preserved a mournful silence as he left the drawing room. He pictured the vanity of his diplomatic career in comparison with Pierre\u2019s happiness. The old general grumbled at his wife when she asked how his leg was. \u201cOh, the old fool,\u201d he thought. \u201cThat Princess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne will be beautiful still when she\u2019s fifty.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think I may congratulate you,\u201d whispered Anna P\u00e1vlovna to the old princess, kissing her soundly. \u201cIf I hadn\u2019t this headache I\u2019d have stayed longer.\u201d\n\nThe old princess did not reply, she was tormented by jealousy of her daughter\u2019s happiness.\n\nWhile the guests were taking their leave Pierre remained for a long time alone with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the little drawing room where they were sitting. He had often before, during the last six weeks, remained alone with her, but had never spoken to her of love. Now he felt that it was inevitable, but he could not make up his mind to take the final step. He felt ashamed; he felt that he was occupying someone else\u2019s place here beside H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cThis happiness is not for you,\u201d some inner voice whispered to him. \u201cThis happiness is for those who have not in them what there is in you.\u201d\n\nBut, as he had to say something, he began by asking her whether she was satisfied with the party. She replied in her usual simple manner that this name day of hers had been one of the pleasantest she had ever had.\n\nSome of the nearest relatives had not yet left. They were sitting in the large drawing room. Prince Vas\u00edli came up to Pierre with languid footsteps. Pierre rose and said it was getting late. Prince Vas\u00edli gave him a look of stern inquiry, as though what Pierre had just said was so strange that one could not take it in. But then the expression of severity changed, and he drew Pierre\u2019s hand downwards, made him sit down, and smiled affectionately.\n\n\u201cWell, L\u00eblya?\u201d he asked, turning instantly to his daughter and addressing her with the careless tone of habitual tenderness natural to parents who have petted their children from babyhood, but which Prince Vas\u00edli had only acquired by imitating other parents.\n\nAnd he again turned to Pierre.\n\n\u201cSerg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch\u2014From all sides\u2014\u201d he said, unbuttoning the top button of his waistcoat.\n\nPierre smiled, but his smile showed that he knew it was not the story about Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch that interested Prince Vas\u00edli just then, and Prince Vas\u00edli saw that Pierre knew this. He suddenly muttered something and went away. It seemed to Pierre that even the prince was disconcerted. The sight of the discomposure of that old man of the world touched Pierre: he looked at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and she too seemed disconcerted, and her look seemed to say: \u201cWell, it is your own fault.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe step must be taken but I cannot, I cannot!\u201d thought Pierre, and he again began speaking about indifferent matters, about Serg\u00e9y Kuzm\u00edch, asking what the point of the story was as he had not heard it properly. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne answered with a smile that she too had missed it.\n\nWhen Prince Vas\u00edli returned to the drawing room, the princess, his wife, was talking in low tones to the elderly lady about Pierre.\n\n\u201cOf course, it is a very brilliant match, but happiness, my dear...\u201d\n\n\u201cMarriages are made in heaven,\u201d replied the elderly lady.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli passed by, seeming not to hear the ladies, and sat down on a sofa in a far corner of the room. He closed his eyes and seemed to be dozing. His head sank forward and then he roused himself.\n\n\u201cAline,\u201d he said to his wife, \u201cgo and see what they are about.\u201d\n\nThe princess went up to the door, passed by it with a dignified and indifferent air, and glanced into the little drawing room. Pierre and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne still sat talking just as before.\n\n\u201cStill the same,\u201d she said to her husband.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli frowned, twisting his mouth, his cheeks quivered and his face assumed the coarse, unpleasant expression peculiar to him. Shaking himself, he rose, threw back his head, and with resolute steps went past the ladies into the little drawing room. With quick steps he went joyfully up to Pierre. His face was so unusually triumphant that Pierre rose in alarm on seeing it.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cMy wife has told me everything!\u201d (He put one arm around Pierre and the other around his daughter.)\u2014\u201cMy dear boy... L\u00eblya... I am very pleased.\u201d (His voice trembled.) \u201cI loved your father... and she will make you a good wife... God bless you!...\u201d\n\nHe embraced his daughter, and then again Pierre, and kissed him with his malodorous mouth. Tears actually moistened his cheeks.\n\n\u201cPrincess, come here!\u201d he shouted.\n\nThe old princess came in and also wept. The elderly lady was using her handkerchief too. Pierre was kissed, and he kissed the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s hand several times. After a while they were left alone again.\n\n\u201cAll this had to be and could not be otherwise,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cso it is useless to ask whether it is good or bad. It is good because it\u2019s definite and one is rid of the old tormenting doubt.\u201d Pierre held the hand of his betrothed in silence, looking at her beautiful bosom as it rose and fell.\n\n\u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne!\u201d he said aloud and paused.\n\n\u201cSomething special is always said in such cases,\u201d he thought, but could not remember what it was that people say. He looked at her face. She drew nearer to him. Her face flushed.\n\n\u201cOh, take those off... those...\u201d she said, pointing to his spectacles.\n\nPierre took them off, and his eyes, besides the strange look eyes have from which spectacles have just been removed, had also a frightened and inquiring look. He was about to stoop over her hand and kiss it, but with a rapid, almost brutal movement of her head, she intercepted his lips and met them with her own. Her face struck Pierre, by its altered, unpleasantly excited expression.\n\n\u201cIt is too late now, it\u2019s done; besides I love her,\u201d thought Pierre.\n\n\u201cJe vous aime!\u201d he said, remembering what has to be said at such moments: but his words sounded so weak that he felt ashamed of himself.\n\nSix weeks later he was married, and settled in Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s large, newly furnished Petersburg house, the happy possessor, as people said, of a wife who was a celebrated beauty and of millions of money.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOld Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski received a letter from Prince Vas\u00edli in November, 1805, announcing that he and his son would be paying him a visit. \u201cI am starting on a journey of inspection, and of course I shall think nothing of an extra seventy miles to come and see you at the same time, my honored benefactor,\u201d wrote Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cMy son Anatole is accompanying me on his way to the army, so I hope you will allow him personally to express the deep respect that, emulating his father, he feels for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt seems that there will be no need to bring Mary out, suitors are coming to us of their own accord,\u201d incautiously remarked the little princess on hearing the news.\n\nPrince Nicholas frowned, but said nothing.\n\nA fortnight after the letter Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s servants came one evening in advance of him, and he and his son arrived next day.\n\nOld Bolk\u00f3nski had always had a poor opinion of Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s character, but more so recently, since in the new reigns of Paul and Alexander Prince Vas\u00edli had risen to high position and honors. And now, from the hints contained in his letter and given by the little princess, he saw which way the wind was blowing, and his low opinion changed into a feeling of contemptuous ill will. He snorted whenever he mentioned him. On the day of Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s arrival, Prince Bolk\u00f3nski was particularly discontented and out of temper. Whether he was in a bad temper because Prince Vas\u00edli was coming, or whether his being in a bad temper made him specially annoyed at Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s visit, he was in a bad temper, and in the morning T\u00edkhon had already advised the architect not to go to the prince with his report.\n\n\u201cDo you hear how he\u2019s walking?\u201d said T\u00edkhon, drawing the architect\u2019s attention to the sound of the prince\u2019s footsteps. \u201cStepping flat on his heels\u2014we know what that means....\u201d\n\nHowever, at nine o\u2019clock the prince, in his velvet coat with a sable collar and cap, went out for his usual walk. It had snowed the day before and the path to the hothouse, along which the prince was in the habit of walking, had been swept: the marks of the broom were still visible in the snow and a shovel had been left sticking in one of the soft snowbanks that bordered both sides of the path. The prince went through the conservatories, the serfs\u2019 quarters, and the outbuildings, frowning and silent.\n\n\u201cCan a sleigh pass?\u201d he asked his overseer, a venerable man, resembling his master in manners and looks, who was accompanying him back to the house.\n\n\u201cThe snow is deep. I am having the avenue swept, your honor.\u201d\n\nThe prince bowed his head and went up to the porch. \u201cGod be thanked,\u201d thought the overseer, \u201cthe storm has blown over!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would have been hard to drive up, your honor,\u201d he added. \u201cI heard, your honor, that a minister is coming to visit your honor.\u201d\n\nThe prince turned round to the overseer and fixed his eyes on him, frowning.\n\n\u201cWhat? A minister? What minister? Who gave orders?\u201d he said in his shrill, harsh voice. \u201cThe road is not swept for the princess my daughter, but for a minister! For me, there are no ministers!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour honor, I thought...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou thought!\u201d shouted the prince, his words coming more and more rapidly and indistinctly. \u201cYou thought!... Rascals! Blackguards!... I\u2019ll teach you to think!\u201d and lifting his stick he swung it and would have hit Alp\u00e1tych, the overseer, had not the latter instinctively avoided the blow. \u201cThought... Blackguards...\u201d shouted the prince rapidly.\n\nBut although Alp\u00e1tych, frightened at his own temerity in avoiding the stroke, came up to the prince, bowing his bald head resignedly before him, or perhaps for that very reason, the prince, though he continued to shout: \u201cBlackguards!... Throw the snow back on the road!\u201d did not lift his stick again but hurried into the house.\n\nBefore dinner, Princess Mary and Mademoiselle Bourienne, who knew that the prince was in a bad humor, stood awaiting him; Mademoiselle Bourienne with a radiant face that said: \u201cI know nothing, I am the same as usual,\u201d and Princess Mary pale, frightened, and with downcast eyes. What she found hardest to bear was to know that on such occasions she ought to behave like Mademoiselle Bourienne, but could not. She thought: \u201cIf I seem not to notice he will think that I do not sympathize with him; if I seem sad and out of spirits myself, he will say (as he has done before) that I\u2019m in the dumps.\u201d\n\nThe prince looked at his daughter\u2019s frightened face and snorted.\n\n\u201cFool... or dummy!\u201d he muttered.\n\n\u201cAnd the other one is not here. They\u2019ve been telling tales,\u201d he thought\u2014referring to the little princess who was not in the dining room.\n\n\u201cWhere is the princess?\u201d he asked. \u201cHiding?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is not very well,\u201d answered Mademoiselle Bourienne with a bright smile, \u201cso she won\u2019t come down. It is natural in her state.\u201d\n\n\u201cHm! Hm!\u201d muttered the prince, sitting down.\n\nHis plate seemed to him not quite clean, and pointing to a spot he flung it away. T\u00edkhon caught it and handed it to a footman. The little princess was not unwell, but had such an overpowering fear of the prince that, hearing he was in a bad humor, she had decided not to appear.\n\n\u201cI am afraid for the baby,\u201d she said to Mademoiselle Bourienne: \u201cHeaven knows what a fright might do.\u201d\n\nIn general at Bald Hills the little princess lived in constant fear, and with a sense of antipathy to the old prince which she did not realize because the fear was so much the stronger feeling. The prince reciprocated this antipathy, but it was overpowered by his contempt for her. When the little princess had grown accustomed to life at Bald Hills, she took a special fancy to Mademoiselle Bourienne, spent whole days with her, asked her to sleep in her room, and often talked with her about the old prince and criticized him.\n\n\u201cSo we are to have visitors, mon prince?\u201d remarked Mademoiselle Bourienne, unfolding her white napkin with her rosy fingers. \u201cHis Excellency Prince Vas\u00edli Kur\u00e1gin and his son, I understand?\u201d she said inquiringly.\n\n\u201cHm!\u2014his excellency is a puppy.... I got him his appointment in the service,\u201d said the prince disdainfully. \u201cWhy his son is coming I don\u2019t understand. Perhaps Princess Elizabeth and Princess Mary know. I don\u2019t want him.\u201d (He looked at his blushing daughter.) \u201cAre you unwell today? Eh? Afraid of the \u2018minister\u2019 as that idiot Alp\u00e1tych called him this morning?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, mon p\u00e8re.\u201d\n\nThough Mademoiselle Bourienne had been so unsuccessful in her choice of a subject, she did not stop talking, but chattered about the conservatories and the beauty of a flower that had just opened, and after the soup the prince became more genial.\n\nAfter dinner, he went to see his daughter-in-law. The little princess was sitting at a small table, chattering with M\u00e1sha, her maid. She grew pale on seeing her father-in-law.\n\nShe was much altered. She was now plain rather than pretty. Her cheeks had sunk, her lip was drawn up, and her eyes drawn down.\n\n\u201cYes, I feel a kind of oppression,\u201d she said in reply to the prince\u2019s question as to how she felt.\n\n\u201cDo you want anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, merci, mon p\u00e8re.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all right, all right.\u201d\n\nHe left the room and went to the waiting room where Alp\u00e1tych stood with bowed head.\n\n\u201cHas the snow been shoveled back?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency. Forgive me for heaven\u2019s sake... It was only my stupidity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d interrupted the prince, and laughing his unnatural way, he stretched out his hand for Alp\u00e1tych to kiss, and then proceeded to his study.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli arrived that evening. He was met in the avenue by coachmen and footmen, who, with loud shouts, dragged his sleighs up to one of the lodges over the road purposely laden with snow.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli and Anatole had separate rooms assigned to them.\n\nAnatole, having taken off his overcoat, sat with arms akimbo before a table on a corner of which he smilingly and absent-mindedly fixed his large and handsome eyes. He regarded his whole life as a continual round of amusement which someone for some reason had to provide for him. And he looked on this visit to a churlish old man and a rich and ugly heiress in the same way. All this might, he thought, turn out very well and amusingly. \u201cAnd why not marry her if she really has so much money? That never does any harm,\u201d thought Anatole.\n\nHe shaved and scented himself with the care and elegance which had become habitual to him and, his handsome head held high, entered his father\u2019s room with the good-humored and victorious air natural to him. Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s two valets were busy dressing him, and he looked round with much animation and cheerfully nodded to his son as the latter entered, as if to say: \u201cYes, that\u2019s how I want you to look.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, Father, joking apart, is she very hideous?\u201d Anatole asked, as if continuing a conversation the subject of which had often been mentioned during the journey.\n\n\u201cEnough! What nonsense! Above all, try to be respectful and cautious with the old prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he starts a row I\u2019ll go away,\u201d said Prince Anatole. \u201cI can\u2019t bear those old men! Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cRemember, for you everything depends on this.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, not only was it known in the maidservants\u2019 rooms that the minister and his son had arrived, but the appearance of both had been minutely described. Princess Mary was sitting alone in her room, vainly trying to master her agitation.\n\n\u201cWhy did they write, why did Lise tell me about it? It can never happen!\u201d she said, looking at herself in the glass. \u201cHow shall I enter the drawing room? Even if I like him I can\u2019t now be myself with him.\u201d The mere thought of her father\u2019s look filled her with terror. The little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne had already received from M\u00e1sha, the lady\u2019s maid, the necessary report of how handsome the minister\u2019s son was, with his rosy cheeks and dark eyebrows, and with what difficulty the father had dragged his legs upstairs while the son had followed him like an eagle, three steps at a time. Having received this information, the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne, whose chattering voices had reached her from the corridor, went into Princess Mary\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cYou know they\u2019ve come, Marie?\u201d said the little princess, waddling in, and sinking heavily into an armchair.\n\nShe was no longer in the loose gown she generally wore in the morning, but had on one of her best dresses. Her hair was carefully done and her face was animated, which, however, did not conceal its sunken and faded outlines. Dressed as she used to be in Petersburg society, it was still more noticeable how much plainer she had become. Some unobtrusive touch had been added to Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s toilet which rendered her fresh and pretty face yet more attractive.\n\n\u201cWhat! Are you going to remain as you are, dear princess?\u201d she began. \u201cThey\u2019ll be announcing that the gentlemen are in the drawing room and we shall have to go down, and you have not smartened yourself up at all!\u201d\n\nThe little princess got up, rang for the maid, and hurriedly and merrily began to devise and carry out a plan of how Princess Mary should be dressed. Princess Mary\u2019s self-esteem was wounded by the fact that the arrival of a suitor agitated her, and still more so by both her companions\u2019 not having the least conception that it could be otherwise. To tell them that she felt ashamed for herself and for them would be to betray her agitation, while to decline their offers to dress her would prolong their banter and insistence. She flushed, her beautiful eyes grew dim, red blotches came on her face, and it took on the unattractive martyrlike expression it so often wore, as she submitted herself to Mademoiselle Bourienne and Lise. Both these women quite sincerely tried to make her look pretty. She was so plain that neither of them could think of her as a rival, so they began dressing her with perfect sincerity, and with the na\u00efve and firm conviction women have that dress can make a face pretty.\n\n\u201cNo really, my dear, this dress is not pretty,\u201d said Lise, looking sideways at Princess Mary from a little distance. \u201cYou have a maroon dress, have it fetched. Really! You know the fate of your whole life may be at stake. But this one is too light, it\u2019s not becoming!\u201d\n\nIt was not the dress, but the face and whole figure of Princess Mary that was not pretty, but neither Mademoiselle Bourienne nor the little princess felt this; they still thought that if a blue ribbon were placed in the hair, the hair combed up, and the blue scarf arranged lower on the best maroon dress, and so on, all would be well. They forgot that the frightened face and the figure could not be altered, and that however they might change the setting and adornment of that face, it would still remain piteous and plain. After two or three changes to which Princess Mary meekly submitted, just as her hair had been arranged on the top of her head (a style that quite altered and spoiled her looks) and she had put on a maroon dress with a pale-blue scarf, the little princess walked twice round her, now adjusting a fold of the dress with her little hand, now arranging the scarf and looking at her with her head bent first on one side and then on the other.\n\n\u201cNo, it will not do,\u201d she said decidedly, clasping her hands. \u201cNo, Mary, really this dress does not suit you. I prefer you in your little gray everyday dress. Now please, do it for my sake. Katie,\u201d she said to the maid, \u201cbring the princess her gray dress, and you\u2019ll see, Mademoiselle Bourienne, how I shall arrange it,\u201d she added, smiling with a foretaste of artistic pleasure.\n\nBut when Katie brought the required dress, Princess Mary remained sitting motionless before the glass, looking at her face, and saw in the mirror her eyes full of tears and her mouth quivering, ready to burst into sobs.\n\n\u201cCome, dear princess,\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \u201cjust one more little effort.\u201d\n\nThe little princess, taking the dress from the maid, came up to Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cWell, now we\u2019ll arrange something quite simple and becoming,\u201d she said.\n\nThe three voices, hers, Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s, and Katie\u2019s, who was laughing at something, mingled in a merry sound, like the chirping of birds.\n\n\u201cNo, leave me alone,\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nHer voice sounded so serious and so sad that the chirping of the birds was silenced at once. They looked at the beautiful, large, thoughtful eyes full of tears and of thoughts, gazing shiningly and imploringly at them, and understood that it was useless and even cruel to insist.\n\n\u201cAt least, change your coiffure,\u201d said the little princess. \u201cDidn\u2019t I tell you,\u201d she went on, turning reproachfully to Mademoiselle Bourienne, \u201cMary\u2019s is a face which such a coiffure does not suit in the least. Not in the least! Please change it.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave me alone, please leave me alone! It is all quite the same to me,\u201d answered a voice struggling with tears.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne and the little princess had to own to themselves that Princess Mary in this guise looked very plain, worse than usual, but it was too late. She was looking at them with an expression they both knew, an expression thoughtful and sad. This expression in Princess Mary did not frighten them (she never inspired fear in anyone), but they knew that when it appeared on her face, she became mute and was not to be shaken in her determination.\n\n\u201cYou will change it, won\u2019t you?\u201d said Lise. And as Princess Mary gave no answer, she left the room.\n\nPrincess Mary was left alone. She did not comply with Lise\u2019s request, she not only left her hair as it was, but did not even look in her glass. Letting her arms fall helplessly, she sat with downcast eyes and pondered. A husband, a man, a strong dominant and strangely attractive being rose in her imagination, and carried her into a totally different happy world of his own. She fancied a child, her own\u2014such as she had seen the day before in the arms of her nurse\u2019s daughter\u2014at her own breast, the husband standing by and gazing tenderly at her and the child. \u201cBut no, it is impossible, I am too ugly,\u201d she thought.\n\n\u201cPlease come to tea. The prince will be out in a moment,\u201d came the maid\u2019s voice at the door.\n\nShe roused herself, and felt appalled at what she had been thinking, and before going down she went into the room where the icons hung and, her eyes fixed on the dark face of a large icon of the Saviour lit by a lamp, she stood before it with folded hands for a few moments. A painful doubt filled her soul. Could the joy of love, of earthly love for a man, be for her? In her thoughts of marriage Princess Mary dreamed of happiness and of children, but her strongest, most deeply hidden longing was for earthly love. The more she tried to hide this feeling from others and even from herself, the stronger it grew. \u201cO God,\u201d she said, \u201chow am I to stifle in my heart these temptations of the devil? How am I to renounce forever these vile fancies, so as peacefully to fulfill Thy will?\u201d And scarcely had she put that question than God gave her the answer in her own heart. \u201cDesire nothing for thyself, seek nothing, be not anxious or envious. Man\u2019s future and thy own fate must remain hidden from thee, but live so that thou mayest be ready for anything. If it be God\u2019s will to prove thee in the duties of marriage, be ready to fulfill His will.\u201d With this consoling thought (but yet with a hope for the fulfillment of her forbidden earthly longing) Princess Mary sighed, and having crossed herself went down, thinking neither of her gown and coiffure nor of how she would go in nor of what she would say. What could all that matter in comparison with the will of God, without Whose care not a hair of man\u2019s head can fall?\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nWhen Princess Mary came down, Prince Vas\u00edli and his son were already in the drawing room, talking to the little princess and Mademoiselle Bourienne. When she entered with her heavy step, treading on her heels, the gentlemen and Mademoiselle Bourienne rose and the little princess, indicating her to the gentlemen, said: \u201cVoil\u00e0 Marie!\u201d Princess Mary saw them all and saw them in detail. She saw Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s face, serious for an instant at the sight of her, but immediately smiling again, and the little princess curiously noting the impression \u201cMarie\u201d produced on the visitors. And she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne, with her ribbon and pretty face, and her unusually animated look which was fixed on him, but him she could not see, she only saw something large, brilliant, and handsome moving toward her as she entered the room. Prince Vas\u00edli approached first, and she kissed the bold forehead that bent over her hand and answered his question by saying that, on the contrary, she remembered him quite well. Then Anatole came up to her. She still could not see him. She only felt a soft hand taking hers firmly, and she touched with her lips a white forehead, over which was beautiful light-brown hair smelling of pomade. When she looked up at him she was struck by his beauty. Anatole stood with his right thumb under a button of his uniform, his chest expanded and his back drawn in, slightly swinging one foot, and, with his head a little bent, looked with beaming face at the princess without speaking and evidently not thinking about her at all. Anatole was not quick-witted, nor ready or eloquent in conversation, but he had the faculty, so invaluable in society, of composure and imperturbable self-possession. If a man lacking in self-confidence remains dumb on a first introduction and betrays a consciousness of the impropriety of such silence and an anxiety to find something to say, the effect is bad. But Anatole was dumb, swung his foot, and smilingly examined the princess\u2019 hair. It was evident that he could be silent in this way for a very long time. \u201cIf anyone finds this silence inconvenient, let him talk, but I don\u2019t want to,\u201d he seemed to say. Besides this, in his behavior to women Anatole had a manner which particularly inspires in them curiosity, awe, and even love\u2014a supercilious consciousness of his own superiority. It was as if he said to them: \u201cI know you, I know you, but why should I bother about you? You\u2019d be only too glad, of course.\u201d Perhaps he did not really think this when he met women\u2014even probably he did not, for in general he thought very little\u2014but his looks and manner gave that impression. The princess felt this, and as if wishing to show him that she did not even dare expect to interest him, she turned to his father. The conversation was general and animated, thanks to Princess Lise\u2019s voice and little downy lip that lifted over her white teeth. She met Prince Vas\u00edli with that playful manner often employed by lively chatty people, and consisting in the assumption that between the person they so address and themselves there are some semi-private, long-established jokes and amusing reminiscences, though no such reminiscences really exist\u2014just as none existed in this case. Prince Vas\u00edli readily adopted her tone and the little princess also drew Anatole, whom she hardly knew, into these amusing recollections of things that had never occurred. Mademoiselle Bourienne also shared them and even Princess Mary felt herself pleasantly made to share in these merry reminiscences.\n\n\u201cHere at least we shall have the benefit of your company all to ourselves, dear prince,\u201d said the little princess (of course, in French) to Prince Vas\u00edli. \u201cIt\u2019s not as at Annette\u2019s receptions where you always ran away; you remember cette ch\u00e8re Annette!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, but you won\u2019t talk politics to me like Annette!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd our little tea table?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it you were never at Annette\u2019s?\u201d the little princess asked Anatole. \u201cAh, I know, I know,\u201d she said with a sly glance, \u201cyour brother Hippolyte told me about your goings on. Oh!\u201d and she shook her finger at him, \u201cI have even heard of your doings in Paris!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd didn\u2019t Hippolyte tell you?\u201d asked Prince Vas\u00edli, turning to his son and seizing the little princess\u2019 arm as if she would have run away and he had just managed to catch her, \u201cdidn\u2019t he tell you how he himself was pining for the dear princess, and how she showed him the door? Oh, she is a pearl among women, Princess,\u201d he added, turning to Princess Mary.\n\nWhen Paris was mentioned, Mademoiselle Bourienne for her part seized the opportunity of joining in the general current of recollections.\n\nShe took the liberty of inquiring whether it was long since Anatole had left Paris and how he had liked that city. Anatole answered the Frenchwoman very readily and, looking at her with a smile, talked to her about her native land. When he saw the pretty little Bourienne, Anatole came to the conclusion that he would not find Bald Hills dull either. \u201cNot at all bad!\u201d he thought, examining her, \u201cnot at all bad, that little companion! I hope she will bring her along with her when we\u2019re married, la petite est gentille.\u201d\n\nThe old prince dressed leisurely in his study, frowning and considering what he was to do. The coming of these visitors annoyed him. \u201cWhat are Prince Vas\u00edli and that son of his to me? Prince Vas\u00edli is a shallow braggart and his son, no doubt, is a fine specimen,\u201d he grumbled to himself. What angered him was that the coming of these visitors revived in his mind an unsettled question he always tried to stifle, one about which he always deceived himself. The question was whether he could ever bring himself to part from his daughter and give her to a husband. The prince never directly asked himself that question, knowing beforehand that he would have to answer it justly, and justice clashed not only with his feelings but with the very possibility of life. Life without Princess Mary, little as he seemed to value her, was unthinkable to him. \u201cAnd why should she marry?\u201d he thought. \u201cTo be unhappy for certain. There\u2019s Lise, married to Andrew\u2014a better husband one would think could hardly be found nowadays\u2014but is she contented with her lot? And who would marry Marie for love? Plain and awkward! They\u2019ll take her for her connections and wealth. Are there no women living unmarried, and even the happier for it?\u201d So thought Prince Bolk\u00f3nski while dressing, and yet the question he was always putting off demanded an immediate answer. Prince Vas\u00edli had brought his son with the evident intention of proposing, and today or tomorrow he would probably ask for an answer. His birth and position in society were not bad. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve nothing against it,\u201d the prince said to himself, \u201cbut he must be worthy of her. And that is what we shall see.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is what we shall see! That is what we shall see!\u201d he added aloud.\n\nHe entered the drawing room with his usual alert step, glancing rapidly round the company. He noticed the change in the little princess\u2019 dress, Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s ribbon, Princess Mary\u2019s unbecoming coiffure, Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s and Anatole\u2019s smiles, and the loneliness of his daughter amid the general conversation. \u201cGot herself up like a fool!\u201d he thought, looking irritably at her. \u201cShe is shameless, and he ignores her!\u201d\n\nHe went straight up to Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cWell! How d\u2019ye do? How d\u2019ye do? Glad to see you!\u201d\n\n\u201cFriendship laughs at distance,\u201d began Prince Vas\u00edli in his usual rapid, self-confident, familiar tone. \u201cHere is my second son; please love and befriend him.\u201d\n\nPrince Bolk\u00f3nski surveyed Anatole.\n\n\u201cFine young fellow! Fine young fellow!\u201d he said. \u201cWell, come and kiss me,\u201d and he offered his cheek.\n\nAnatole kissed the old man, and looked at him with curiosity and perfect composure, waiting for a display of the eccentricities his father had told him to expect.\n\nPrince Bolk\u00f3nski sat down in his usual place in the corner of the sofa and, drawing up an armchair for Prince Vas\u00edli, pointed to it and began questioning him about political affairs and news. He seemed to listen attentively to what Prince Vas\u00edli said, but kept glancing at Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cAnd so they are writing from Potsdam already?\u201d he said, repeating Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s last words. Then rising, he suddenly went up to his daughter.\n\n\u201cIs it for visitors you\u2019ve got yourself up like that, eh?\u201d said he. \u201cFine, very fine! You have done up your hair in this new way for the visitors, and before the visitors I tell you that in future you are never to dare to change your way of dress without my consent.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was my fault, mon p\u00e8re,\u201d interceded the little princess, with a blush.\n\n\u201cYou must do as you please,\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, bowing to his daughter-in-law, \u201cbut she need not make a fool of herself, she\u2019s plain enough as it is.\u201d\n\nAnd he sat down again, paying no more attention to his daughter, who was reduced to tears.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, that coiffure suits the princess very well,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cNow you, young prince, what\u2019s your name?\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, turning to Anatole, \u201ccome here, let us talk and get acquainted.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow the fun begins,\u201d thought Anatole, sitting down with a smile beside the old prince.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear boy, I hear you\u2019ve been educated abroad, not taught to read and write by the deacon, like your father and me. Now tell me, my dear boy, are you serving in the Horse Guards?\u201d asked the old man, scrutinizing Anatole closely and intently.\n\n\u201cNo, I have been transferred to the line,\u201d said Anatole, hardly able to restrain his laughter.\n\n\u201cAh! That\u2019s a good thing. So, my dear boy, you wish to serve the Tsar and the country? It is wartime. Such a fine fellow must serve. Well, are you off to the front?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Prince, our regiment has gone to the front, but I am attached... what is it I am attached to, Papa?\u201d said Anatole, turning to his father with a laugh.\n\n\u201cA splendid soldier, splendid! \u2018What am I attached to!\u2019 Ha, ha, ha!\u201d laughed Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, and Anatole laughed still louder. Suddenly Prince Bolk\u00f3nski frowned.\n\n\u201cYou may go,\u201d he said to Anatole.\n\nAnatole returned smiling to the ladies.\n\n\u201cAnd so you\u2019ve had him educated abroad, Prince Vas\u00edli, haven\u2019t you?\u201d said the old prince to Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cI have done my best for him, and I can assure you the education there is much better than ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, everything is different nowadays, everything is changed. The lad\u2019s a fine fellow, a fine fellow! Well, come with me now.\u201d He took Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s arm and led him to his study. As soon as they were alone together, Prince Vas\u00edli announced his hopes and wishes to the old prince.\n\n\u201cWell, do you think I shall prevent her, that I can\u2019t part from her?\u201d said the old prince angrily. \u201cWhat an idea! I\u2019m ready for it tomorrow! Only let me tell you, I want to know my son-in-law better. You know my principles\u2014everything aboveboard! I will ask her tomorrow in your presence; if she is willing, then he can stay on. He can stay and I\u2019ll see.\u201d The old prince snorted. \u201cLet her marry, it\u2019s all the same to me!\u201d he screamed in the same piercing tone as when parting from his son.\n\n\u201cI will tell you frankly,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli in the tone of a crafty man convinced of the futility of being cunning with so keen-sighted a companion. \u201cYou know, you see right through people. Anatole is no genius, but he is an honest, goodhearted lad; an excellent son or kinsman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, we\u2019ll see!\u201d\n\nAs always happens when women lead lonely lives for any length of time without male society, on Anatole\u2019s appearance all the three women of Prince Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s household felt that their life had not been real till then. Their powers of reasoning, feeling, and observing immediately increased tenfold, and their life, which seemed to have been passed in darkness, was suddenly lit up by a new brightness, full of significance.\n\nPrincess Mary grew quite unconscious of her face and coiffure. The handsome open face of the man who might perhaps be her husband absorbed all her attention. He seemed to her kind, brave, determined, manly, and magnanimous. She felt convinced of that. Thousands of dreams of a future family life continually rose in her imagination. She drove them away and tried to conceal them.\n\n\u201cBut am I not too cold with him?\u201d thought the princess. \u201cI try to be reserved because in the depth of my soul I feel too near to him already, but then he cannot know what I think of him and may imagine that I do not like him.\u201d\n\nAnd Princess Mary tried, but could not manage, to be cordial to her new guest. \u201cPoor girl, she\u2019s devilish ugly!\u201d thought Anatole.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne, also roused to great excitement by Anatole\u2019s arrival, thought in another way. Of course, she, a handsome young woman without any definite position, without relations or even a country, did not intend to devote her life to serving Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, to reading aloud to him and being friends with Princess Mary. Mademoiselle Bourienne had long been waiting for a Russian prince who, able to appreciate at a glance her superiority to the plain, badly dressed, ungainly Russian princesses, would fall in love with her and carry her off; and here at last was a Russian prince. Mademoiselle Bourienne knew a story, heard from her aunt but finished in her own way, which she liked to repeat to herself. It was the story of a girl who had been seduced, and to whom her poor mother (sa pauvre m\u00e8re) appeared, and reproached her for yielding to a man without being married. Mademoiselle Bourienne was often touched to tears as in imagination she told this story to him, her seducer. And now he, a real Russian prince, had appeared. He would carry her away and then sa pauvre m\u00e8re would appear and he would marry her. So her future shaped itself in Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s head at the very time she was talking to Anatole about Paris. It was not calculation that guided her (she did not even for a moment consider what she should do), but all this had long been familiar to her, and now that Anatole had appeared it just grouped itself around him and she wished and tried to please him as much as possible.\n\nThe little princess, like an old war horse that hears the trumpet, unconsciously and quite forgetting her condition, prepared for the familiar gallop of coquetry, without any ulterior motive or any struggle, but with na\u00efve and lighthearted gaiety.\n\nAlthough in female society Anatole usually assumed the role of a man tired of being run after by women, his vanity was flattered by the spectacle of his power over these three women. Besides that, he was beginning to feel for the pretty and provocative Mademoiselle Bourienne that passionate animal feeling which was apt to master him with great suddenness and prompt him to the coarsest and most reckless actions.\n\nAfter tea, the company went into the sitting room and Princess Mary was asked to play on the clavichord. Anatole, laughing and in high spirits, came and leaned on his elbows, facing her and beside Mademoiselle Bourienne. Princess Mary felt his look with a painfully joyous emotion. Her favorite sonata bore her into a most intimately poetic world and the look she felt upon her made that world still more poetic. But Anatole\u2019s expression, though his eyes were fixed on her, referred not to her but to the movements of Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s little foot, which he was then touching with his own under the clavichord. Mademoiselle Bourienne was also looking at Princess Mary, and in her lovely eyes there was a look of fearful joy and hope that was also new to the princess.\n\n\u201cHow she loves me!\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cHow happy I am now, and how happy I may be with such a friend and such a husband! Husband? Can it be possible?\u201d she thought, not daring to look at his face, but still feeling his eyes gazing at her.\n\nIn the evening, after supper, when all were about to retire, Anatole kissed Princess Mary\u2019s hand. She did not know how she found the courage, but she looked straight into his handsome face as it came near to her shortsighted eyes. Turning from Princess Mary he went up and kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s hand. (This was not etiquette, but then he did everything so simply and with such assurance!) Mademoiselle Bourienne flushed, and gave the princess a frightened look.\n\n\u201cWhat delicacy!\u201d thought the princess. \u201cIs it possible that Am\u00e9lie\u201d (Mademoiselle Bourienne) \u201cthinks I could be jealous of her, and not value her pure affection and devotion to me?\u201d She went up to her and kissed her warmly. Anatole went up to kiss the little princess\u2019 hand.\n\n\u201cNo! No! No! When your father writes to tell me that you are behaving well I will give you my hand to kiss. Not till then!\u201d she said. And smilingly raising a finger at him, she left the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThey all separated, but, except Anatole who fell asleep as soon as he got into bed, all kept awake a long time that night.\n\n\u201cIs he really to be my husband, this stranger who is so kind\u2014yes, kind, that is the chief thing,\u201d thought Princess Mary; and fear, which she had seldom experienced, came upon her. She feared to look round, it seemed to her that someone was there standing behind the screen in the dark corner. And this someone was he\u2014the devil\u2014and he was also this man with the white forehead, black eyebrows, and red lips.\n\nShe rang for her maid and asked her to sleep in her room.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne walked up and down the conservatory for a long time that evening, vainly expecting someone, now smiling at someone, now working herself up to tears with the imaginary words of her pauvre m\u00e8re rebuking her for her fall.\n\nThe little princess grumbled to her maid that her bed was badly made. She could not lie either on her face or on her side. Every position was awkward and uncomfortable, and her burden oppressed her now more than ever because Anatole\u2019s presence had vividly recalled to her the time when she was not like that and when everything was light and gay. She sat in an armchair in her dressing jacket and nightcap and Katie, sleepy and disheveled, beat and turned the heavy feather bed for the third time, muttering to herself.\n\n\u201cI told you it was all lumps and holes!\u201d the little princess repeated. \u201cI should be glad enough to fall asleep, so it\u2019s not my fault!\u201d and her voice quivered like that of a child about to cry.\n\nThe old prince did not sleep either. T\u00edkhon, half asleep, heard him pacing angrily about and snorting. The old prince felt as though he had been insulted through his daughter. The insult was the more pointed because it concerned not himself but another, his daughter, whom he loved more than himself. He kept telling himself that he would consider the whole matter and decide what was right and how he should act, but instead of that he only excited himself more and more.\n\n\u201cThe first man that turns up\u2014she forgets her father and everything else, runs upstairs and does up her hair and wags her tail and is unlike herself! Glad to throw her father over! And she knew I should notice it. Fr... fr... fr! And don\u2019t I see that that idiot had eyes only for Bourienne\u2014I shall have to get rid of her. And how is it she has not pride enough to see it? If she has no pride for herself she might at least have some for my sake! She must be shown that the blockhead thinks nothing of her and looks only at Bourienne. No, she has no pride... but I\u2019ll let her see....\u201d\n\nThe old prince knew that if he told his daughter she was making a mistake and that Anatole meant to flirt with Mademoiselle Bourienne, Princess Mary\u2019s self-esteem would be wounded and his point (not to be parted from her) would be gained, so pacifying himself with this thought, he called T\u00edkhon and began to undress.\n\n\u201cWhat devil brought them here?\u201d thought he, while T\u00edkhon was putting the nightshirt over his dried-up old body and gray-haired chest. \u201cI never invited them. They came to disturb my life\u2014and there is not much of it left.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevil take \u2018em!\u201d he muttered, while his head was still covered by the shirt.\n\nT\u00edkhon knew his master\u2019s habit of sometimes thinking aloud, and therefore met with unaltered looks the angrily inquisitive expression of the face that emerged from the shirt.\n\n\u201cGone to bed?\u201d asked the prince.\n\nT\u00edkhon, like all good valets, instinctively knew the direction of his master\u2019s thoughts. He guessed that the question referred to Prince Vas\u00edli and his son.\n\n\u201cThey have gone to bed and put out their lights, your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo good... no good...\u201d said the prince rapidly, and thrusting his feet into his slippers and his arms into the sleeves of his dressing gown, he went to the couch on which he slept.\n\nThough no words had passed between Anatole and Mademoiselle Bourienne, they quite understood one another as to the first part of their romance, up to the appearance of the pauvre m\u00e8re; they understood that they had much to say to one another in private and so they had been seeking an opportunity since morning to meet one another alone. When Princess Mary went to her father\u2019s room at the usual hour, Mademoiselle Bourienne and Anatole met in the conservatory.\n\nPrincess Mary went to the door of the study with special trepidation. It seemed to her that not only did everybody know that her fate would be decided that day, but that they also knew what she thought about it. She read this in T\u00edkhon\u2019s face and in that of Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s valet, who made her a low bow when she met him in the corridor carrying hot water.\n\nThe old prince was very affectionate and careful in his treatment of his daughter that morning. Princess Mary well knew this painstaking expression of her father\u2019s. His face wore that expression when his dry hands clenched with vexation at her not understanding a sum in arithmetic, when rising from his chair he would walk away from her, repeating in a low voice the same words several times over.\n\nHe came to the point at once, treating her ceremoniously.\n\n\u201cI have had a proposition made me concerning you,\u201d he said with an unnatural smile. \u201cI expect you have guessed that Prince Vas\u00edli has not come and brought his pupil with him\u201d (for some reason Prince Bolk\u00f3nski referred to Anatole as a \u201cpupil\u201d) \u201cfor the sake of my beautiful eyes. Last night a proposition was made me on your account and, as you know my principles, I refer it to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow am I to understand you, mon p\u00e8re?\u201d said the princess, growing pale and then blushing.\n\n\u201cHow understand me!\u201d cried her father angrily. \u201cPrince Vas\u00edli finds you to his taste as a daughter-in-law and makes a proposal to you on his pupil\u2019s behalf. That\u2019s how it\u2019s to be understood! \u2018How understand it\u2019!... And I ask you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not know what you think, Father,\u201d whispered the princess.\n\n\u201cI? I? What of me? Leave me out of the question. I\u2019m not going to get married. What about you? That\u2019s what I want to know.\u201d\n\nThe princess saw that her father regarded the matter with disapproval, but at that moment the thought occurred to her that her fate would be decided now or never. She lowered her eyes so as not to see the gaze under which she felt that she could not think, but would only be able to submit from habit, and she said: \u201cI wish only to do your will, but if I had to express my own desire...\u201d She had no time to finish. The old prince interrupted her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s admirable!\u201d he shouted. \u201cHe will take you with your dowry and take Mademoiselle Bourienne into the bargain. She\u2019ll be the wife, while you...\u201d\n\nThe prince stopped. He saw the effect these words had produced on his daughter. She lowered her head and was ready to burst into tears.\n\n\u201cNow then, now then, I\u2019m only joking!\u201d he said. \u201cRemember this, Princess, I hold to the principle that a maiden has a full right to choose. I give you freedom. Only remember that your life\u2019s happiness depends on your decision. Never mind me!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I do not know, Father!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need to talk! He receives his orders and will marry you or anybody; but you are free to choose.... Go to your room, think it over, and come back in an hour and tell me in his presence: yes or no. I know you will pray over it. Well, pray if you like, but you had better think it over. Go! Yes or no, yes or no, yes or no!\u201d he still shouted when the princess, as if lost in a fog, had already staggered out of the study.\n\nHer fate was decided and happily decided. But what her father had said about Mademoiselle Bourienne was dreadful. It was untrue to be sure, but still it was terrible, and she could not help thinking of it. She was going straight on through the conservatory, neither seeing nor hearing anything, when suddenly the well-known whispering of Mademoiselle Bourienne aroused her. She raised her eyes, and two steps away saw Anatole embracing the Frenchwoman and whispering something to her. With a horrified expression on his handsome face, Anatole looked at Princess Mary, but did not at once take his arm from the waist of Mademoiselle Bourienne who had not yet seen her.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that? Why? Wait a moment!\u201d Anatole\u2019s face seemed to say. Princess Mary looked at them in silence. She could not understand it. At last Mademoiselle Bourienne gave a scream and ran away. Anatole bowed to Princess Mary with a gay smile, as if inviting her to join in a laugh at this strange incident, and then shrugging his shoulders went to the door that led to his own apartments.\n\nAn hour later, T\u00edkhon came to call Princess Mary to the old prince; he added that Prince Vas\u00edli was also there. When T\u00edkhon came to her Princess Mary was sitting on the sofa in her room, holding the weeping Mademoiselle Bourienne in her arms and gently stroking her hair. The princess\u2019 beautiful eyes with all their former calm radiance were looking with tender affection and pity at Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s pretty face.\n\n\u201cNo, Princess, I have lost your affection forever!\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\u201cWhy? I love you more than ever,\u201d said Princess Mary, \u201cand I will try to do all I can for your happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you despise me. You who are so pure can never understand being so carried away by passion. Oh, only my poor mother...\u201d\n\n\u201cI quite understand,\u201d answered Princess Mary, with a sad smile. \u201cCalm yourself, my dear. I will go to my father,\u201d she said, and went out.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli, with one leg thrown high over the other and a snuffbox in his hand, was sitting there with a smile of deep emotion on his face, as if stirred to his heart\u2019s core and himself regretting and laughing at his own sensibility, when Princess Mary entered. He hurriedly took a pinch of snuff.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear, my dear!\u201d he began, rising and taking her by both hands. Then, sighing, he added: \u201cMy son\u2019s fate is in your hands. Decide, my dear, good, gentle Marie, whom I have always loved as a daughter!\u201d\n\nHe drew back and a real tear appeared in his eye.\n\n\u201cFr... fr...\u201d snorted Prince Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cThe prince is making a proposition to you in his pupil\u2019s\u2014I mean, his son\u2019s\u2014name. Do you wish or not to be Prince Anatole Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s wife? Reply: yes or no,\u201d he shouted, \u201cand then I shall reserve the right to state my opinion also. Yes, my opinion, and only my opinion,\u201d added Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, turning to Prince Vas\u00edli and answering his imploring look. \u201cYes, or no?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy desire is never to leave you, Father, never to separate my life from yours. I don\u2019t wish to marry,\u201d she answered positively, glancing at Prince Vas\u00edli and at her father with her beautiful eyes.\n\n\u201cHumbug! Nonsense! Humbug, humbug, humbug!\u201d cried Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, frowning and taking his daughter\u2019s hand; he did not kiss her, but only bending his forehead to hers just touched it, and pressed her hand so that she winced and uttered a cry.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli rose.\n\n\u201cMy dear, I must tell you that this is a moment I shall never, never forget. But, my dear, will you not give us a little hope of touching this heart, so kind and generous? Say \u2018perhaps\u2019... The future is so long. Say \u2018perhaps.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince, what I have said is all there is in my heart. I thank you for the honor, but I shall never be your son\u2019s wife.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, so that\u2019s finished, my dear fellow! I am very glad to have seen you. Very glad! Go back to your rooms, Princess. Go!\u201d said the old prince. \u201cVery, very glad to have seen you,\u201d repeated he, embracing Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cMy vocation is a different one,\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cMy vocation is to be happy with another kind of happiness, the happiness of love and self-sacrifice. And cost what it may, I will arrange poor Am\u00e9lie\u2019s happiness, she loves him so passionately, and so passionately repents. I will do all I can to arrange the match between them. If he is not rich I will give her the means; I will ask my father and Andrew. I shall be so happy when she is his wife. She is so unfortunate, a stranger, alone, helpless! And, oh God, how passionately she must love him if she could so far forget herself! Perhaps I might have done the same!...\u201d thought Princess Mary.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nIt was long since the Rost\u00f3vs had news of Nicholas. Not till midwinter was the count at last handed a letter addressed in his son\u2019s handwriting. On receiving it, he ran on tiptoe to his study in alarm and haste, trying to escape notice, closed the door, and began to read the letter.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, who always knew everything that passed in the house, on hearing of the arrival of the letter went softly into the room and found the count with it in his hand, sobbing and laughing at the same time.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, though her circumstances had improved, was still living with the Rost\u00f3vs.\n\n\u201cMy dear friend?\u201d said she, in a tone of pathetic inquiry, prepared to sympathize in any way.\n\nThe count sobbed yet more.\n\n\u201cNik\u00f3lenka... a letter... wa... a... s... wounded... my darling boy... the countess... promoted to be an officer... thank God... How tell the little countess!\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna sat down beside him, with her own handkerchief wiped the tears from his eyes and from the letter, then having dried her own eyes she comforted the count, and decided that at dinner and till teatime she would prepare the countess, and after tea, with God\u2019s help, would inform her.\n\nAt dinner Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna talked the whole time about the war news and about Nik\u00f3lenka, twice asked when the last letter had been received from him, though she knew that already, and remarked that they might very likely be getting a letter from him that day. Each time that these hints began to make the countess anxious and she glanced uneasily at the count and at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, the latter very adroitly turned the conversation to insignificant matters. Nat\u00e1sha, who, of the whole family, was the most gifted with a capacity to feel any shades of intonation, look, and expression, pricked up her ears from the beginning of the meal and was certain that there was some secret between her father and Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, that it had something to do with her brother, and that Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna was preparing them for it. Bold as she was, Nat\u00e1sha, who knew how sensitive her mother was to anything relating to Nik\u00f3lenka, did not venture to ask any questions at dinner, but she was too excited to eat anything and kept wriggling about on her chair regardless of her governess\u2019 remarks. After dinner, she rushed headlong after Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and, dashing at her, flung herself on her neck as soon as she overtook her in the sitting room.\n\n\u201cAuntie, darling, do tell me what it is!\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing, my dear.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, dearest, sweet one, honey, I won\u2019t give up\u2014I know you know something.\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna shook her head.\n\n\u201cYou are a little slyboots,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA letter from Nik\u00f3lenka! I\u2019m sure of it!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha, reading confirmation in Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cBut for God\u2019s sake, be careful, you know how it may affect your mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will, I will, only tell me! You won\u2019t? Then I will go and tell at once.\u201d\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, in a few words, told her the contents of the letter, on condition that she should tell no one.\n\n\u201cNo, on my true word of honor,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, crossing herself, \u201cI won\u2019t tell anyone!\u201d and she ran off at once to S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cNik\u00f3lenka... wounded... a letter,\u201d she announced in gleeful triumph.\n\n\u201cNicholas!\u201d was all S\u00f3nya said, instantly turning white.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, seeing the impression the news of her brother\u2019s wound produced on S\u00f3nya, felt for the first time the sorrowful side of the news.\n\nShe rushed to S\u00f3nya, hugged her, and began to cry.\n\n\u201cA little wound, but he has been made an officer; he is well now, he wrote himself,\u201d said she through her tears.\n\n\u201cThere now! It\u2019s true that all you women are crybabies,\u201d remarked P\u00e9tya, pacing the room with large, resolute strides. \u201cNow I\u2019m very glad, very glad indeed, that my brother has distinguished himself so. You are all blubberers and understand nothing.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha smiled through her tears.\n\n\u201cYou haven\u2019t read the letter?\u201d asked S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cNo, but she said that it was all over and that he\u2019s now an officer.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said S\u00f3nya, crossing herself. \u201cBut perhaps she deceived you. Let us go to Mamma.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9tya paced the room in silence for a time.\n\n\u201cIf I\u2019d been in Nik\u00f3lenka\u2019s place I would have killed even more of those Frenchmen,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat nasty brutes they are! I\u2019d have killed so many that there\u2019d have been a heap of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHold your tongue, P\u00e9tya, what a goose you are!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a goose, but they are who cry about trifles,\u201d said P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cDo you remember him?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly asked, after a moment\u2019s silence.\n\nS\u00f3nya smiled.\n\n\u201cDo I remember Nicholas?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, S\u00f3nya, but do you remember so that you remember him perfectly, remember everything?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, with an expressive gesture, evidently wishing to give her words a very definite meaning. \u201cI remember Nik\u00f3lenka too, I remember him well,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t remember Bor\u00eds. I don\u2019t remember him a bit.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! You don\u2019t remember Bor\u00eds?\u201d asked S\u00f3nya in surprise.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that I don\u2019t remember\u2014I know what he is like, but not as I remember Nik\u00f3lenka. Him\u2014I just shut my eyes and remember, but Bor\u00eds... No!\u201d (She shut her eyes.) \u201cNo! there\u2019s nothing at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d said S\u00f3nya, looking ecstatically and earnestly at her friend as if she did not consider her worthy to hear what she meant to say and as if she were saying it to someone else, with whom joking was out of the question, \u201cI am in love with your brother once for all and, whatever may happen to him or to me, shall never cease to love him as long as I live.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at S\u00f3nya with wondering and inquisitive eyes, and said nothing. She felt that S\u00f3nya was speaking the truth, that there was such love as S\u00f3nya was speaking of. But Nat\u00e1sha had not yet felt anything like it. She believed it could be, but did not understand it.\n\n\u201cShall you write to him?\u201d she asked.\n\nS\u00f3nya became thoughtful. The question of how to write to Nicholas, and whether she ought to write, tormented her. Now that he was already an officer and a wounded hero, would it be right to remind him of herself and, as it might seem, of the obligations to her he had taken on himself?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I think if he writes, I will write too,\u201d she said, blushing.\n\n\u201cAnd you won\u2019t feel ashamed to write to him?\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya smiled.\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I should be ashamed to write to Bor\u00eds. I\u2019m not going to.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should you be ashamed?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s awkward and would make me ashamed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I know why she\u2019d be ashamed,\u201d said P\u00e9tya, offended by Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s previous remark. \u201cIt\u2019s because she was in love with that fat one in spectacles\u201d (that was how P\u00e9tya described his namesake, the new Count Bez\u00fakhov) \u201cand now she\u2019s in love with that singer\u201d (he meant Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s Italian singing master), \u201cthat\u2019s why she\u2019s ashamed!\u201d\n\n\u201cP\u00e9tya, you\u2019re stupid!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cNot more stupid than you, madam,\u201d said the nine-year-old P\u00e9tya, with the air of an old brigadier.\n\nThe countess had been prepared by Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s hints at dinner. On retiring to her own room, she sat in an armchair, her eyes fixed on a miniature portrait of her son on the lid of a snuffbox, while the tears kept coming into her eyes. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, with the letter, came on tiptoe to the countess\u2019 door and paused.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t come in,\u201d she said to the old count who was following her. \u201cCome later.\u201d And she went in, closing the door behind her.\n\nThe count put his ear to the keyhole and listened.\n\nAt first he heard the sound of indifferent voices, then Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s voice alone in a long speech, then a cry, then silence, then both voices together with glad intonations, and then footsteps. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna opened the door. Her face wore the proud expression of a surgeon who has just performed a difficult operation and admits the public to appreciate his skill.\n\n\u201cIt is done!\u201d she said to the count, pointing triumphantly to the countess, who sat holding in one hand the snuffbox with its portrait and in the other the letter, and pressing them alternately to her lips.\n\nWhen she saw the count, she stretched out her arms to him, embraced his bald head, over which she again looked at the letter and the portrait, and in order to press them again to her lips, she slightly pushed away the bald head. V\u00e9ra, Nat\u00e1sha, S\u00f3nya, and P\u00e9tya now entered the room, and the reading of the letter began. After a brief description of the campaign and the two battles in which he had taken part, and his promotion, Nicholas said that he kissed his father\u2019s and mother\u2019s hands asking for their blessing, and that he kissed V\u00e9ra, Nat\u00e1sha, and P\u00e9tya. Besides that, he sent greetings to Monsieur Schelling, Madame Schoss, and his old nurse, and asked them to kiss for him \u201cdear S\u00f3nya, whom he loved and thought of just the same as ever.\u201d When she heard this S\u00f3nya blushed so that tears came into her eyes and, unable to bear the looks turned upon her, ran away into the dancing hall, whirled round it at full speed with her dress puffed out like a balloon, and, flushed and smiling, plumped down on the floor. The countess was crying.\n\n\u201cWhy are you crying, Mamma?\u201d asked V\u00e9ra. \u201cFrom all he says one should be glad and not cry.\u201d\n\nThis was quite true, but the count, the countess, and Nat\u00e1sha looked at her reproachfully. \u201cAnd who is it she takes after?\u201d thought the countess.\n\nNicholas\u2019 letter was read over hundreds of times, and those who were considered worthy to hear it had to come to the countess, for she did not let it out of her hands. The tutors came, and the nurses, and Dm\u00edtri, and several acquaintances, and the countess reread the letter each time with fresh pleasure and each time discovered in it fresh proofs of Nik\u00f3lenka\u2019s virtues. How strange, how extraordinary, how joyful it seemed, that her son, the scarcely perceptible motion of whose tiny limbs she had felt twenty years ago within her, that son about whom she used to have quarrels with the too indulgent count, that son who had first learned to say \u201cpear\u201d and then \u201cgranny,\u201d that this son should now be away in a foreign land amid strange surroundings, a manly warrior doing some kind of man\u2019s work of his own, without help or guidance. The universal experience of ages, showing that children do grow imperceptibly from the cradle to manhood, did not exist for the countess. Her son\u2019s growth toward manhood, at each of its stages, had seemed as extraordinary to her as if there had never existed the millions of human beings who grew up in the same way. As twenty years before, it seemed impossible that the little creature who lived somewhere under her heart would ever cry, suck her breast, and begin to speak, so now she could not believe that that little creature could be this strong, brave man, this model son and officer that, judging by this letter, he now was.\n\n\u201cWhat a style! How charmingly he describes!\u201d said she, reading the descriptive part of the letter. \u201cAnd what a soul! Not a word about himself.... Not a word! About some Den\u00edsov or other, though he himself, I dare say, is braver than any of them. He says nothing about his sufferings. What a heart! How like him it is! And how he has remembered everybody! Not forgetting anyone. I always said when he was only so high\u2014I always said....\u201d\n\nFor more than a week preparations were being made, rough drafts of letters to Nicholas from all the household were written and copied out, while under the supervision of the countess and the solicitude of the count, money and all things necessary for the uniform and equipment of the newly commissioned officer were collected. Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, practical woman that she was, had even managed by favor with army authorities to secure advantageous means of communication for herself and her son. She had opportunities of sending her letters to the Grand Duke Constantine P\u00e1vlovich, who commanded the Guards. The Rost\u00f3vs supposed that The Russian Guards, Abroad, was quite a definite address, and that if a letter reached the Grand Duke in command of the Guards there was no reason why it should not reach the P\u00e1vlograd regiment, which was presumably somewhere in the same neighborhood. And so it was decided to send the letters and money by the Grand Duke\u2019s courier to Bor\u00eds and Bor\u00eds was to forward them to Nicholas. The letters were from the old count, the countess, P\u00e9tya, V\u00e9ra, Nat\u00e1sha, and S\u00f3nya, and finally there were six thousand rubles for his outfit and various other things the old count sent to his son.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nOn the twelfth of November, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s active army, in camp before Olm\u00fctz, was preparing to be reviewed next day by the two Emperors\u2014the Russian and the Austrian. The Guards, just arrived from Russia, spent the night ten miles from Olm\u00fctz and next morning were to come straight to the review, reaching the field at Olm\u00fctz by ten o\u2019clock", "sequence": 5}, {"offset": 600000, "text": ".\n\nThat day Nicholas Rost\u00f3v received a letter from Bor\u00eds, telling him that the Ism\u00e1ylov regiment was quartered for the night ten miles from Olm\u00fctz and that he wanted to see him as he had a letter and money for him. Rost\u00f3v was particularly in need of money now that the troops, after their active service, were stationed near Olm\u00fctz and the camp swarmed with well-provisioned sutlers and Austrian Jews offering all sorts of tempting wares. The P\u00e1vlograds held feast after feast, celebrating awards they had received for the campaign, and made expeditions to Olm\u00fctz to visit a certain Caroline the Hungarian, who had recently opened a restaurant there with girls as waitresses. Rost\u00f3v, who had just celebrated his promotion to a cornetcy and bought Den\u00edsov\u2019s horse, Bedouin, was in debt all round, to his comrades and the sutlers. On receiving Bor\u00eds\u2019 letter he rode with a fellow officer to Olm\u00fctz, dined there, drank a bottle of wine, and then set off alone to the Guards\u2019 camp to find his old playmate. Rost\u00f3v had not yet had time to get his uniform. He had on a shabby cadet jacket, decorated with a soldier\u2019s cross, equally shabby cadet\u2019s riding breeches lined with worn leather, and an officer\u2019s saber with a sword knot. The Don horse he was riding was one he had bought from a Cossack during the campaign, and he wore a crumpled hussar cap stuck jauntily back on one side of his head. As he rode up to the camp he thought how he would impress Bor\u00eds and all his comrades of the Guards by his appearance\u2014that of a fighting hussar who had been under fire.\n\nThe Guards had made their whole march as if on a pleasure trip, parading their cleanliness and discipline. They had come by easy stages, their knapsacks conveyed on carts, and the Austrian authorities had provided excellent dinners for the officers at every halting place. The regiments had entered and left the town with their bands playing, and by the Grand Duke\u2019s orders the men had marched all the way in step (a practice on which the Guards prided themselves), the officers on foot and at their proper posts. Bor\u00eds had been quartered, and had marched all the way, with Berg who was already in command of a company. Berg, who had obtained his captaincy during the campaign, had gained the confidence of his superiors by his promptitude and accuracy and had arranged his money matters very satisfactorily. Bor\u00eds, during the campaign, had made the acquaintance of many persons who might prove useful to him, and by a letter of recommendation he had brought from Pierre had become acquainted with Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski, through whom he hoped to obtain a post on the commander in chief\u2019s staff. Berg and Bor\u00eds, having rested after yesterday\u2019s march, were sitting, clean and neatly dressed, at a round table in the clean quarters allotted to them, playing chess. Berg held a smoking pipe between his knees. Bor\u00eds, in the accurate way characteristic of him, was building a little pyramid of chessmen with his delicate white fingers while awaiting Berg\u2019s move, and watched his opponent\u2019s face, evidently thinking about the game as he always thought only of whatever he was engaged on.\n\n\u201cWell, how are you going to get out of that?\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll try to,\u201d replied Berg, touching a pawn and then removing his hand.\n\nAt that moment the door opened.\n\n\u201cHere he is at last!\u201d shouted Rost\u00f3v. \u201cAnd Berg too! Oh, you petisenfans, allay cushay dormir!\u201d he exclaimed, imitating his Russian nurse\u2019s French, at which he and Bor\u00eds used to laugh long ago.\n\n\u201cDear me, how you have changed!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds rose to meet Rost\u00f3v, but in doing so did not omit to steady and replace some chessmen that were falling. He was about to embrace his friend, but Nicholas avoided him. With that peculiar feeling of youth, that dread of beaten tracks, and wish to express itself in a manner different from that of its elders which is often insincere, Nicholas wished to do something special on meeting his friend. He wanted to pinch him, push him, do anything but kiss him\u2014a thing everybody did. But notwithstanding this, Bor\u00eds embraced him in a quiet, friendly way and kissed him three times.\n\nThey had not met for nearly half a year and, being at the age when young men take their first steps on life\u2019s road, each saw immense changes in the other, quite a new reflection of the society in which they had taken those first steps. Both had changed greatly since they last met and both were in a hurry to show the changes that had taken place in them.\n\n\u201cOh, you damned dandies! Clean and fresh as if you\u2019d been to a fete, not like us sinners of the line,\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v, with martial swagger and with baritone notes in his voice, new to Bor\u00eds, pointing to his own mud-bespattered breeches. The German landlady, hearing Rost\u00f3v\u2019s loud voice, popped her head in at the door.\n\n\u201cEh, is she pretty?\u201d he asked with a wink.\n\n\u201cWhy do you shout so? You\u2019ll frighten them!\u201d said Bor\u00eds. \u201cI did not expect you today,\u201d he added. \u201cI only sent you the note yesterday by Bolk\u00f3nski\u2014an adjutant of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s, who\u2019s a friend of mine. I did not think he would get it to you so quickly.... Well, how are you? Been under fire already?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds.\n\nWithout answering, Rost\u00f3v shook the soldier\u2019s Cross of St. George fastened to the cording of his uniform and, indicating a bandaged arm, glanced at Berg with a smile.\n\n\u201cAs you see,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIndeed? Yes, yes!\u201d said Bor\u00eds, with a smile. \u201cAnd we too have had a splendid march. You know, of course, that His Imperial Highness rode with our regiment all the time, so that we had every comfort and every advantage. What receptions we had in Poland! What dinners and balls! I can\u2019t tell you. And the Tsar\u00e9vich was very gracious to all our officers.\u201d\n\nAnd the two friends told each other of their doings, the one of his hussar revels and life in the fighting line, the other of the pleasures and advantages of service under members of the Imperial family.\n\n\u201cOh, you Guards!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI say, send for some wine.\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds made a grimace.\n\n\u201cIf you really want it,\u201d said he.\n\nHe went to his bed, drew a purse from under the clean pillow, and sent for wine.\n\n\u201cYes, and I have some money and a letter to give you,\u201d he added.\n\nRost\u00f3v took the letter and, throwing the money on the sofa, put both arms on the table and began to read. After reading a few lines, he glanced angrily at Berg, then, meeting his eyes, hid his face behind the letter.\n\n\u201cWell, they\u2019ve sent you a tidy sum,\u201d said Berg, eying the heavy purse that sank into the sofa. \u201cAs for us, Count, we get along on our pay. I can tell you for myself...\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, Berg, my dear fellow,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, \u201cwhen you get a letter from home and meet one of your own people whom you want to talk everything over with, and I happen to be there, I\u2019ll go at once, to be out of your way! Do go somewhere, anywhere... to the devil!\u201d he exclaimed, and immediately seizing him by the shoulder and looking amiably into his face, evidently wishing to soften the rudeness of his words, he added, \u201cDon\u2019t be hurt, my dear fellow; you know I speak from my heart as to an old acquaintance.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t mention it, Count! I quite understand,\u201d said Berg, getting up and speaking in a muffled and guttural voice.\n\n\u201cGo across to our hosts: they invited you,\u201d added Bor\u00eds.\n\nBerg put on the cleanest of coats, without a spot or speck of dust, stood before a looking glass and brushed the hair on his temples upwards, in the way affected by the Emperor Alexander, and, having assured himself from the way Rost\u00f3v looked at it that his coat had been noticed, left the room with a pleasant smile.\n\n\u201cOh dear, what a beast I am!\u201d muttered Rost\u00f3v, as he read the letter.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, what a pig I am, not to have written and to have given them such a fright! Oh, what a pig I am!\u201d he repeated, flushing suddenly. \u201cWell, have you sent Gabriel for some wine? All right let\u2019s have some!\u201d\n\nIn the letter from his parents was enclosed a letter of recommendation to Bagrati\u00f3n which the old countess at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s advice had obtained through an acquaintance and sent to her son, asking him to take it to its destination and make use of it.\n\n\u201cWhat nonsense! Much I need it!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, throwing the letter under the table.\n\n\u201cWhy have you thrown that away?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cIt is some letter of recommendation... what the devil do I want it for!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy \u2018What the devil\u2019?\u201d said Bor\u00eds, picking it up and reading the address. \u201cThis letter would be of great use to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want nothing, and I won\u2019t be anyone\u2019s adjutant.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d inquired Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a lackey\u2019s job!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are still the same dreamer, I see,\u201d remarked Bor\u00eds, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re still the same diplomatist! But that\u2019s not the point... Come, how are you?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWell, as you see. So far everything\u2019s all right, but I confess I should much like to be an adjutant and not remain at the front.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause when once a man starts on military service, he should try to make as successful a career of it as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that\u2019s it!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, evidently thinking of something else.\n\nHe looked intently and inquiringly into his friend\u2019s eyes, evidently trying in vain to find the answer to some question.\n\nOld Gabriel brought in the wine.\n\n\u201cShouldn\u2019t we now send for Berg?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds. \u201cHe would drink with you. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, send for him... and how do you get on with that German?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v, with a contemptuous smile.\n\n\u201cHe is a very, very nice, honest, and pleasant fellow,\u201d answered Bor\u00eds.\n\nAgain Rost\u00f3v looked intently into Bor\u00eds\u2019 eyes and sighed. Berg returned, and over the bottle of wine conversation between the three officers became animated. The Guardsmen told Rost\u00f3v of their march and how they had been made much of in Russia, Poland, and abroad. They spoke of the sayings and doings of their commander, the Grand Duke, and told stories of his kindness and irascibility. Berg, as usual, kept silent when the subject did not relate to himself, but in connection with the stories of the Grand Duke\u2019s quick temper he related with gusto how in Galicia he had managed to deal with the Grand Duke when the latter made a tour of the regiments and was annoyed at the irregularity of a movement. With a pleasant smile Berg related how the Grand Duke had ridden up to him in a violent passion, shouting: \u201cArnauts!\u201d (\u201cArnauts\u201d was the Tsar\u00e9vich\u2019s favorite expression when he was in a rage) and called for the company commander.\n\n\u201cWould you believe it, Count, I was not at all alarmed, because I knew I was right. Without boasting, you know, I may say that I know the Army Orders by heart and know the Regulations as well as I do the Lord\u2019s Prayer. So, Count, there never is any negligence in my company, and so my conscience was at ease. I came forward....\u201d (Berg stood up and showed how he presented himself, with his hand to his cap, and really it would have been difficult for a face to express greater respect and self-complacency than his did.) \u201cWell, he stormed at me, as the saying is, stormed and stormed and stormed! It was not a matter of life but rather of death, as the saying is. \u2018Albanians!\u2019 and \u2018devils!\u2019 and \u2018To Siberia!\u2019\u201d said Berg with a sagacious smile. \u201cI knew I was in the right so I kept silent; was not that best, Count?... \u2018Hey, are you dumb?\u2019 he shouted. Still I remained silent. And what do you think, Count? The next day it was not even mentioned in the Orders of the Day. That\u2019s what keeping one\u2019s head means. That\u2019s the way, Count,\u201d said Berg, lighting his pipe and emitting rings of smoke.\n\n\u201cYes, that was fine,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, smiling.\n\nBut Bor\u00eds noticed that he was preparing to make fun of Berg, and skillfully changed the subject. He asked him to tell them how and where he got his wound. This pleased Rost\u00f3v and he began talking about it, and as he went on became more and more animated. He told them of his Sch\u00f6n Grabern affair, just as those who have taken part in a battle generally do describe it, that is, as they would like it to have been, as they have heard it described by others, and as sounds well, but not at all as it really was. Rost\u00f3v was a truthful young man and would on no account have told a deliberate lie. He began his story meaning to tell everything just as it happened, but imperceptibly, involuntarily, and inevitably he lapsed into falsehood. If he had told the truth to his hearers\u2014who like himself had often heard stories of attacks and had formed a definite idea of what an attack was and were expecting to hear just such a story\u2014they would either not have believed him or, still worse, would have thought that Rost\u00f3v was himself to blame since what generally happens to the narrators of cavalry attacks had not happened to him. He could not tell them simply that everyone went at a trot and that he fell off his horse and sprained his arm and then ran as hard as he could from a Frenchman into the wood. Besides, to tell everything as it really happened, it would have been necessary to make an effort of will to tell only what happened. It is very difficult to tell the truth, and young people are rarely capable of it. His hearers expected a story of how beside himself and all aflame with excitement, he had flown like a storm at the square, cut his way in, slashed right and left, how his saber had tasted flesh and he had fallen exhausted, and so on. And so he told them all that.\n\nIn the middle of his story, just as he was saying: \u201cYou cannot imagine what a strange frenzy one experiences during an attack,\u201d Prince Andrew, whom Bor\u00eds was expecting, entered the room. Prince Andrew, who liked to help young men, was flattered by being asked for his assistance and being well disposed toward Bor\u00eds, who had managed to please him the day before, he wished to do what the young man wanted. Having been sent with papers from Kut\u00fazov to the Tsar\u00e9vich, he looked in on Bor\u00eds, hoping to find him alone. When he came in and saw an hussar of the line recounting his military exploits (Prince Andrew could not endure that sort of man), he gave Bor\u00eds a pleasant smile, frowned as with half-closed eyes he looked at Rost\u00f3v, bowed slightly and wearily, and sat down languidly on the sofa: he felt it unpleasant to have dropped in on bad company. Rost\u00f3v flushed up on noticing this, but he did not care, this was a mere stranger. Glancing, however, at Bor\u00eds, he saw that he too seemed ashamed of the hussar of the line.\n\nIn spite of Prince Andrew\u2019s disagreeable, ironical tone, in spite of the contempt with which Rost\u00f3v, from his fighting army point of view, regarded all these little adjutants on the staff of whom the newcomer was evidently one, Rost\u00f3v felt confused, blushed, and became silent. Bor\u00eds inquired what news there might be on the staff, and what, without indiscretion, one might ask about our plans.\n\n\u201cWe shall probably advance,\u201d replied Bolk\u00f3nski, evidently reluctant to say more in the presence of a stranger.\n\nBerg took the opportunity to ask, with great politeness, whether, as was rumored, the allowance of forage money to captains of companies would be doubled. To this Prince Andrew answered with a smile that he could give no opinion on such an important government order, and Berg laughed gaily.\n\n\u201cAs to your business,\u201d Prince Andrew continued, addressing Bor\u00eds, \u201cwe will talk of it later\u201d (and he looked round at Rost\u00f3v). \u201cCome to me after the review and we will do what is possible.\u201d\n\nAnd, having glanced round the room, Prince Andrew turned to Rost\u00f3v, whose state of unconquerable childish embarrassment now changing to anger he did not condescend to notice, and said: \u201cI think you were talking of the Sch\u00f6n Grabern affair? Were you there?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was there,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v angrily, as if intending to insult the aide-de-camp.\n\nBolk\u00f3nski noticed the hussar\u2019s state of mind, and it amused him. With a slightly contemptuous smile, he said: \u201cYes, there are many stories now told about that affair!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, stories!\u201d repeated Rost\u00f3v loudly, looking with eyes suddenly grown furious, now at Bor\u00eds, now at Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cYes, many stories! But our stories are the stories of men who have been under the enemy\u2019s fire! Our stories have some weight, not like the stories of those fellows on the staff who get rewards without doing anything!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf whom you imagine me to be one?\u201d said Prince Andrew, with a quiet and particularly amiable smile.\n\nA strange feeling of exasperation and yet of respect for this man\u2019s self-possession mingled at that moment in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s soul.\n\n\u201cI am not talking about you,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t know you and, frankly, I don\u2019t want to. I am speaking of the staff in general.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I will tell you this,\u201d Prince Andrew interrupted in a tone of quiet authority, \u201cyou wish to insult me, and I am ready to agree with you that it would be very easy to do so if you haven\u2019t sufficient self-respect, but admit that the time and place are very badly chosen. In a day or two we shall all have to take part in a greater and more serious duel, and besides, Drubetsk\u00f3y, who says he is an old friend of yours, is not at all to blame that my face has the misfortune to displease you. However,\u201d he added rising, \u201cyou know my name and where to find me, but don\u2019t forget that I do not regard either myself or you as having been at all insulted, and as a man older than you, my advice is to let the matter drop. Well then, on Friday after the review I shall expect you, Drubetsk\u00f3y. Au revoir!\u201d exclaimed Prince Andrew, and with a bow to them both he went out.\n\nOnly when Prince Andrew was gone did Rost\u00f3v think of what he ought to have said. And he was still more angry at having omitted to say it. He ordered his horse at once and, coldly taking leave of Bor\u00eds, rode home. Should he go to headquarters next day and challenge that affected adjutant, or really let the matter drop, was the question that worried him all the way. He thought angrily of the pleasure he would have at seeing the fright of that small and frail but proud man when covered by his pistol, and then he felt with surprise that of all the men he knew there was none he would so much like to have for a friend as that very adjutant whom he so hated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe day after Rost\u00f3v had been to see Bor\u00eds, a review was held of the Austrian and Russian troops, both those freshly arrived from Russia and those who had been campaigning under Kut\u00fazov. The two Emperors, the Russian with his heir the Tsar\u00e9vich, and the Austrian with the Archduke, inspected the allied army of eighty thousand men.\n\nFrom early morning the smart clean troops were on the move, forming up on the field before the fortress. Now thousands of feet and bayonets moved and halted at the officers\u2019 command, turned with banners flying, formed up at intervals, and wheeled round other similar masses of infantry in different uniforms; now was heard the rhythmic beat of hoofs and the jingling of showy cavalry in blue, red, and green braided uniforms, with smartly dressed bandsmen in front mounted on black, roan, or gray horses; then again, spreading out with the brazen clatter of the polished shining cannon that quivered on the gun carriages and with the smell of linstocks, came the artillery which crawled between the infantry and cavalry and took up its appointed position. Not only the generals in full parade uniforms, with their thin or thick waists drawn in to the utmost, their red necks squeezed into their stiff collars, and wearing scarves and all their decorations, not only the elegant, pomaded officers, but every soldier with his freshly washed and shaven face and his weapons clean and polished to the utmost, and every horse groomed till its coat shone like satin and every hair of its wetted mane lay smooth\u2014felt that no small matter was happening, but an important and solemn affair. Every general and every soldier was conscious of his own insignificance, aware of being but a drop in that ocean of men, and yet at the same time was conscious of his strength as a part of that enormous whole.\n\nFrom early morning strenuous activities and efforts had begun and by ten o\u2019clock all had been brought into due order. The ranks were drawn up on the vast field. The whole army was extended in three lines: the cavalry in front, behind it the artillery, and behind that again the infantry.\n\nA space like a street was left between each two lines of troops. The three parts of that army were sharply distinguished: Kut\u00fazov\u2019s fighting army (with the P\u00e1vlograds on the right flank of the front); those recently arrived from Russia, both Guards and regiments of the line; and the Austrian troops. But they all stood in the same lines, under one command, and in a like order.\n\nLike wind over leaves ran an excited whisper: \u201cThey\u2019re coming! They\u2019re coming!\u201d Alarmed voices were heard, and a stir of final preparation swept over all the troops.\n\nFrom the direction of Olm\u00fctz in front of them, a group was seen approaching. And at that moment, though the day was still, a light gust of wind blowing over the army slightly stirred the streamers on the lances and the unfolded standards fluttered against their staffs. It looked as if by that slight motion the army itself was expressing its joy at the approach of the Emperors. One voice was heard shouting: \u201cEyes front!\u201d Then, like the crowing of cocks at sunrise, this was repeated by others from various sides and all became silent.\n\nIn the deathlike stillness only the tramp of horses was heard. This was the Emperors\u2019 suites. The Emperors rode up to the flank, and the trumpets of the first cavalry regiment played the general march. It seemed as though not the trumpeters were playing, but as if the army itself, rejoicing at the Emperors\u2019 approach, had naturally burst into music. Amid these sounds, only the youthful kindly voice of the Emperor Alexander was clearly heard. He gave the words of greeting, and the first regiment roared \u201cHurrah!\u201d so deafeningly, continuously, and joyfully that the men themselves were awed by their multitude and the immensity of the power they constituted.\n\nRost\u00f3v, standing in the front lines of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s army which the Tsar approached first, experienced the same feeling as every other man in that army: a feeling of self-forgetfulness, a proud consciousness of might, and a passionate attraction to him who was the cause of this triumph.\n\nHe felt that at a single word from that man all this vast mass (and he himself an insignificant atom in it) would go through fire and water, commit crime, die, or perform deeds of highest heroism, and so he could not but tremble and his heart stand still at the imminence of that word.\n\n\u201cHurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!\u201d thundered from all sides, one regiment after another greeting the Tsar with the strains of the march, and then \u201cHurrah!\u201d... Then the general march, and again \u201cHurrah! Hurrah!\u201d growing ever stronger and fuller and merging into a deafening roar.\n\nTill the Tsar reached it, each regiment in its silence and immobility seemed like a lifeless body, but as soon as he came up it became alive, its thunder joining the roar of the whole line along which he had already passed. Through the terrible and deafening roar of those voices, amid the square masses of troops standing motionless as if turned to stone, hundreds of riders composing the suites moved carelessly but symmetrically and above all freely, and in front of them two men\u2014the Emperors. Upon them the undivided, tensely passionate attention of that whole mass of men was concentrated.\n\nThe handsome young Emperor Alexander, in the uniform of the Horse Guards, wearing a cocked hat with its peaks front and back, with his pleasant face and resonant though not loud voice, attracted everyone\u2019s attention.\n\nRost\u00f3v was not far from the trumpeters, and with his keen sight had recognized the Tsar and watched his approach. When he was within twenty paces, and Nicholas could clearly distinguish every detail of his handsome, happy young face, he experienced a feeling of tenderness and ecstasy such as he had never before known. Every trait and every movement of the Tsar\u2019s seemed to him enchanting.\n\nStopping in front of the P\u00e1vlograds, the Tsar said something in French to the Austrian Emperor and smiled.\n\nSeeing that smile, Rost\u00f3v involuntarily smiled himself and felt a still stronger flow of love for his sovereign. He longed to show that love in some way and knowing that this was impossible was ready to cry. The Tsar called the colonel of the regiment and said a few words to him.\n\n\u201cOh God, what would happen to me if the Emperor spoke to me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cI should die of happiness!\u201d\n\nThe Tsar addressed the officers also: \u201cI thank you all, gentlemen, I thank you with my whole heart.\u201d To Rost\u00f3v every word sounded like a voice from heaven. How gladly would he have died at once for his Tsar!\n\n\u201cYou have earned the St. George\u2019s standards and will be worthy of them.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, to die, to die for him,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\nThe Tsar said something more which Rost\u00f3v did not hear, and the soldiers, straining their lungs, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v too, bending over his saddle, shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with all his might, feeling that he would like to injure himself by that shout, if only to express his rapture fully.\n\nThe Tsar stopped a few minutes in front of the hussars as if undecided.\n\n\u201cHow can the Emperor be undecided?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, but then even this indecision appeared to him majestic and enchanting, like everything else the Tsar did.\n\nThat hesitation lasted only an instant. The Tsar\u2019s foot, in the narrow pointed boot then fashionable, touched the groin of the bobtailed bay mare he rode, his hand in a white glove gathered up the reins, and he moved off accompanied by an irregularly swaying sea of aides-de-camp. Farther and farther he rode away, stopping at other regiments, till at last only his white plumes were visible to Rost\u00f3v from amid the suites that surrounded the Emperors.\n\nAmong the gentlemen of the suite, Rost\u00f3v noticed Bolk\u00f3nski, sitting his horse indolently and carelessly. Rost\u00f3v recalled their quarrel of yesterday and the question presented itself whether he ought or ought not to challenge Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cOf course not!\u201d he now thought. \u201cIs it worth thinking or speaking of it at such a moment? At a time of such love, such rapture, and such self-sacrifice, what do any of our quarrels and affronts matter? I love and forgive everybody now.\u201d\n\nWhen the Emperor had passed nearly all the regiments, the troops began a ceremonial march past him, and Rost\u00f3v on Bedouin, recently purchased from Den\u00edsov, rode past too, at the rear of his squadron\u2014that is, alone and in full view of the Emperor.\n\nBefore he reached him, Rost\u00f3v, who was a splendid horseman, spurred Bedouin twice and successfully put him to the showy trot in which the animal went when excited. Bending his foaming muzzle to his chest, his tail extended, Bedouin, as if also conscious of the Emperor\u2019s eye upon him, passed splendidly, lifting his feet with a high and graceful action, as if flying through the air without touching the ground.\n\nRost\u00f3v himself, his legs well back and his stomach drawn in and feeling himself one with his horse, rode past the Emperor with a frowning but blissful face \u201clike a vewy devil,\u201d as Den\u00edsov expressed it.\n\n\u201cFine fellows, the P\u00e1vlograds!\u201d remarked the Emperor.\n\n\u201cMy God, how happy I should be if he ordered me to leap into the fire this instant!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\nWhen the review was over, the newly arrived officers, and also Kut\u00fazov\u2019s, collected in groups and began to talk about the awards, about the Austrians and their uniforms, about their lines, about Bonaparte, and how badly the latter would fare now, especially if the Essen corps arrived and Prussia took our side.\n\nBut the talk in every group was chiefly about the Emperor Alexander. His every word and movement was described with ecstasy.\n\nThey all had but one wish: to advance as soon as possible against the enemy under the Emperor\u2019s command. Commanded by the Emperor himself they could not fail to vanquish anyone, be it whom it might: so thought Rost\u00f3v and most of the officers after the review.\n\nAll were then more confident of victory than the winning of two battles would have made them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe day after the review, Bor\u00eds, in his best uniform and with his comrade Berg\u2019s best wishes for success, rode to Olm\u00fctz to see Bolk\u00f3nski, wishing to profit by his friendliness and obtain for himself the best post he could\u2014preferably that of adjutant to some important personage, a position in the army which seemed to him most attractive. \u201cIt is all very well for Rost\u00f3v, whose father sends him ten thousand rubles at a time, to talk about not wishing to cringe to anybody and not be anyone\u2019s lackey, but I who have nothing but my brains have to make a career and must not miss opportunities, but must avail myself of them!\u201d he reflected.\n\nHe did not find Prince Andrew in Olm\u00fctz that day, but the appearance of the town where the headquarters and the diplomatic corps were stationed and the two Emperors were living with their suites, households, and courts only strengthened his desire to belong to that higher world.\n\nHe knew no one, and despite his smart Guardsman\u2019s uniform, all these exalted personages passing in the streets in their elegant carriages with their plumes, ribbons, and medals, both courtiers and military men, seemed so immeasurably above him, an insignificant officer of the Guards, that they not only did not wish to, but simply could not, be aware of his existence. At the quarters of the commander in chief, Kut\u00fazov, where he inquired for Bolk\u00f3nski, all the adjutants and even the orderlies looked at him as if they wished to impress on him that a great many officers like him were always coming there and that everybody was heartily sick of them. In spite of this, or rather because of it, next day, November 15, after dinner he again went to Olm\u00fctz and, entering the house occupied by Kut\u00fazov, asked for Bolk\u00f3nski. Prince Andrew was in and Bor\u00eds was shown into a large hall probably formerly used for dancing, but in which five beds now stood, and furniture of various kinds: a table, chairs, and a clavichord. One adjutant, nearest the door, was sitting at the table in a Persian dressing gown, writing. Another, the red, stout Nesv\u00edtski, lay on a bed with his arms under his head, laughing with an officer who had sat down beside him. A third was playing a Viennese waltz on the clavichord, while a fourth, lying on the clavichord, sang the tune. Bolk\u00f3nski was not there. None of these gentlemen changed his position on seeing Bor\u00eds. The one who was writing and whom Bor\u00eds addressed turned round crossly and told him Bolk\u00f3nski was on duty and that he should go through the door on the left into the reception room if he wished to see him. Bor\u00eds thanked him and went to the reception room, where he found some ten officers and generals.\n\nWhen he entered, Prince Andrew, his eyes drooping contemptuously (with that peculiar expression of polite weariness which plainly says, \u201cIf it were not my duty I would not talk to you for a moment\u201d), was listening to an old Russian general with decorations, who stood very erect, almost on tiptoe, with a soldier\u2019s obsequious expression on his purple face, reporting something.\n\n\u201cVery well, then, be so good as to wait,\u201d said Prince Andrew to the general, in Russian, speaking with the French intonation he affected when he wished to speak contemptuously, and noticing Bor\u00eds, Prince Andrew, paying no more heed to the general who ran after him imploring him to hear something more, nodded and turned to him with a cheerful smile.\n\nAt that moment Bor\u00eds clearly realized what he had before surmised, that in the army, besides the subordination and discipline prescribed in the military code, which he and the others knew in the regiment, there was another, more important, subordination, which made this tight-laced, purple-faced general wait respectfully while Captain Prince Andrew, for his own pleasure, chose to chat with Lieutenant Drubetsk\u00f3y. More than ever was Bor\u00eds resolved to serve in future not according to the written code, but under this unwritten law. He felt now that merely by having been recommended to Prince Andrew he had already risen above the general who at the front had the power to annihilate him, a lieutenant of the Guards. Prince Andrew came up to him and took his hand.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry you did not find me in yesterday. I was fussing about with Germans all day. We went with Weyrother to survey the dispositions. When Germans start being accurate, there\u2019s no end to it!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds smiled, as if he understood what Prince Andrew was alluding to as something generally known. But it was the first time he had heard Weyrother\u2019s name, or even the term \u201cdispositions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, my dear fellow, so you still want to be an adjutant? I have been thinking about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I was thinking\u201d\u2014for some reason Bor\u00eds could not help blushing\u2014\u201cof asking the commander in chief. He has had a letter from Prince Kur\u00e1gin about me. I only wanted to ask because I fear the Guards won\u2019t be in action,\u201d he added as if in apology.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right. We\u2019ll talk it over,\u201d replied Prince Andrew. \u201cOnly let me report this gentleman\u2019s business, and I shall be at your disposal.\u201d\n\nWhile Prince Andrew went to report about the purple-faced general, that gentleman\u2014evidently not sharing Bor\u00eds\u2019 conception of the advantages of the unwritten code of subordination\u2014looked so fixedly at the presumptuous lieutenant who had prevented his finishing what he had to say to the adjutant that Bor\u00eds felt uncomfortable. He turned away and waited impatiently for Prince Andrew\u2019s return from the commander in chief\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cYou see, my dear fellow, I have been thinking about you,\u201d said Prince Andrew when they had gone into the large room where the clavichord was. \u201cIt\u2019s no use your going to the commander in chief. He would say a lot of pleasant things, ask you to dinner\u201d (\u201cThat would not be bad as regards the unwritten code,\u201d thought Bor\u00eds), \u201cbut nothing more would come of it. There will soon be a battalion of us aides-de-camp and adjutants! But this is what we\u2019ll do: I have a good friend, an adjutant general and an excellent fellow, Prince Dolgor\u00fakov; and though you may not know it, the fact is that now Kut\u00fazov with his staff and all of us count for nothing. Everything is now centered round the Emperor. So we will go to Dolgor\u00fakov; I have to go there anyhow and I have already spoken to him about you. We shall see whether he cannot attach you to himself or find a place for you somewhere nearer the sun.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew always became specially keen when he had to guide a young man and help him to worldly success. Under cover of obtaining help of this kind for another, which from pride he would never accept for himself, he kept in touch with the circle which confers success and which attracted him. He very readily took up Bor\u00eds\u2019 cause and went with him to Dolgor\u00fakov.\n\nIt was late in the evening when they entered the palace at Olm\u00fctz occupied by the Emperors and their retinues.\n\nThat same day a council of war had been held in which all the members of the Hofkriegsrath and both Emperors took part. At that council, contrary to the views of the old generals Kut\u00fazov and Prince Schwartzenberg, it had been decided to advance immediately and give battle to Bonaparte. The council of war was just over when Prince Andrew accompanied by Bor\u00eds arrived at the palace to find Dolgor\u00fakov. Everyone at headquarters was still under the spell of the day\u2019s council, at which the party of the young had triumphed. The voices of those who counseled delay and advised waiting for something else before advancing had been so completely silenced and their arguments confuted by such conclusive evidence of the advantages of attacking that what had been discussed at the council\u2014the coming battle and the victory that would certainly result from it\u2014no longer seemed to be in the future but in the past. All the advantages were on our side. Our enormous forces, undoubtedly superior to Napoleon\u2019s, were concentrated in one place, the troops inspired by the Emperors\u2019 presence were eager for action. The strategic position where the operations would take place was familiar in all its details to the Austrian General Weyrother: a lucky accident had ordained that the Austrian army should maneuver the previous year on the very fields where the French had now to be fought; the adjacent locality was known and shown in every detail on the maps, and Bonaparte, evidently weakened, was undertaking nothing.\n\nDolgor\u00fakov, one of the warmest advocates of an attack, had just returned from the council, tired and exhausted but eager and proud of the victory that had been gained. Prince Andrew introduced his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, but Prince Dolgor\u00fakov politely and firmly pressing his hand said nothing to Bor\u00eds and, evidently unable to suppress the thoughts which were uppermost in his mind at that moment, addressed Prince Andrew in French.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear fellow, what a battle we have gained! God grant that the one that will result from it will be as victorious! However, dear fellow,\u201d he said abruptly and eagerly, \u201cI must confess to having been unjust to the Austrians and especially to Weyrother. What exactitude, what minuteness, what knowledge of the locality, what foresight for every eventuality, every possibility even to the smallest detail! No, my dear fellow, no conditions better than our present ones could have been devised. This combination of Austrian precision with Russian valor\u2014what more could be wished for?\u201d\n\n\u201cSo the attack is definitely resolved on?\u201d asked Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cAnd do you know, my dear fellow, it seems to me that Bonaparte has decidedly lost bearings, you know that a letter was received from him today for the Emperor.\u201d Dolgor\u00fakov smiled significantly.\n\n\u201cIs that so? And what did he say?\u201d inquired Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cWhat can he say? Tra-di-ri-di-ra and so on... merely to gain time. I tell you he is in our hands, that\u2019s certain! But what was most amusing,\u201d he continued, with a sudden, good-natured laugh, \u201cwas that we could not think how to address the reply! If not as \u2018Consul\u2019 and of course not as \u2018Emperor,\u2019 it seemed to me it should be to \u2018General Bonaparte.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cBut between not recognizing him as Emperor and calling him General Bonaparte, there is a difference,\u201d remarked Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s just it,\u201d interrupted Dolgor\u00fakov quickly, laughing. \u201cYou know Bil\u00edbin\u2014he\u2019s a very clever fellow. He suggested addressing him as \u2018Usurper and Enemy of Mankind.\u2019\u201d\n\nDolgor\u00fakov laughed merrily.\n\n\u201cOnly that?\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cAll the same, it was Bil\u00edbin who found a suitable form for the address. He is a wise and clever fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo the Head of the French Government... Au chef du gouvernement fran\u00e7ais,\u201d said Dolgor\u00fakov, with grave satisfaction. \u201cGood, wasn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but he will dislike it extremely,\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cOh yes, very much! My brother knows him, he\u2019s dined with him\u2014the present Emperor\u2014more than once in Paris, and tells me he never met a more cunning or subtle diplomatist\u2014you know, a combination of French adroitness and Italian play-acting! Do you know the tale about him and Count Mark\u00f3v? Count Mark\u00f3v was the only man who knew how to handle him. You know the story of the handkerchief? It is delightful!\u201d\n\nAnd the talkative Dolgor\u00fakov, turning now to Bor\u00eds, now to Prince Andrew, told how Bonaparte wishing to test Mark\u00f3v, our ambassador, purposely dropped a handkerchief in front of him and stood looking at Mark\u00f3v, probably expecting Mark\u00f3v to pick it up for him, and how Mark\u00f3v immediately dropped his own beside it and picked it up without touching Bonaparte\u2019s.\n\n\u201cDelightful!\u201d said Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cBut I have come to you, Prince, as a petitioner on behalf of this young man. You see...\u201d but before Prince Andrew could finish, an aide-de-camp came in to summon Dolgor\u00fakov to the Emperor.\n\n\u201cOh, what a nuisance,\u201d said Dolgor\u00fakov, getting up hurriedly and pressing the hands of Prince Andrew and Bor\u00eds. \u201cYou know I should be very glad to do all in my power both for you and for this dear young man.\u201d Again he pressed the hand of the latter with an expression of good-natured, sincere, and animated levity. \u201cBut you see... another time!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds was excited by the thought of being so close to the higher powers as he felt himself to be at that moment. He was conscious that here he was in contact with the springs that set in motion the enormous movements of the mass of which in his regiment he felt himself a tiny, obedient, and insignificant atom. They followed Prince Dolgor\u00fakov out into the corridor and met\u2014coming out of the door of the Emperor\u2019s room by which Dolgor\u00fakov had entered\u2014a short man in civilian clothes with a clever face and sharply projecting jaw which, without spoiling his face, gave him a peculiar vivacity and shiftiness of expression. This short man nodded to Dolgor\u00fakov as to an intimate friend and stared at Prince Andrew with cool intensity, walking straight toward him and evidently expecting him to bow or to step out of his way. Prince Andrew did neither: a look of animosity appeared on his face and the other turned away and went down the side of the corridor.\n\n\u201cWho was that?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cHe is one of the most remarkable, but to me most unpleasant of men\u2014the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Prince Adam Czartor\u00fdski.... It is such men as he who decide the fate of nations,\u201d added Bolk\u00f3nski with a sigh he could not suppress, as they passed out of the palace.\n\nNext day, the army began its campaign, and up to the very battle of Austerlitz, Bor\u00eds was unable to see either Prince Andrew or Dolgor\u00fakov again and remained for a while with the Ism\u00e1ylov regiment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAt dawn on the sixteenth of November, Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron, in which Nicholas Rost\u00f3v served and which was in Prince Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s detachment, moved from the place where it had spent the night, advancing into action as arranged, and after going behind other columns for about two thirds of a mile was stopped on the highroad. Rost\u00f3v saw the Cossacks and then the first and second squadrons of hussars and infantry battalions and artillery pass by and go forward and then Generals Bagrati\u00f3n and Dolgor\u00fakov ride past with their adjutants. All the fear before action which he had experienced as previously, all the inner struggle to conquer that fear, all his dreams of distinguishing himself as a true hussar in this battle, had been wasted. Their squadron remained in reserve and Nicholas Rost\u00f3v spent that day in a dull and wretched mood. At nine in the morning, he heard firing in front and shouts of hurrah, and saw wounded being brought back (there were not many of them), and at last he saw how a whole detachment of French cavalry was brought in, convoyed by a s\u00f3tnya of Cossacks. Evidently the affair was over and, though not big, had been a successful engagement. The men and officers returning spoke of a brilliant victory, of the occupation of the town of Wischau and the capture of a whole French squadron. The day was bright and sunny after a sharp night frost, and the cheerful glitter of that autumn day was in keeping with the news of victory which was conveyed, not only by the tales of those who had taken part in it, but also by the joyful expression on the faces of soldiers, officers, generals, and adjutants, as they passed Rost\u00f3v going or coming. And Nicholas, who had vainly suffered all the dread that precedes a battle and had spent that happy day in inactivity, was all the more depressed.\n\n\u201cCome here, Wost\u00f3v. Let\u2019s dwink to dwown our gwief!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, who had settled down by the roadside with a flask and some food.\n\nThe officers gathered round Den\u00edsov\u2019s canteen, eating and talking.\n\n\u201cThere! They are bringing another!\u201d cried one of the officers, indicating a captive French dragoon who was being brought in on foot by two Cossacks.\n\nOne of them was leading by the bridle a fine large French horse he had taken from the prisoner.\n\n\u201cSell us that horse!\u201d Den\u00edsov called out to the Cossacks.\n\n\u201cIf you like, your honor!\u201d\n\nThe officers got up and stood round the Cossacks and their prisoner. The French dragoon was a young Alsatian who spoke French with a German accent. He was breathless with agitation, his face was red, and when he heard some French spoken he at once began speaking to the officers, addressing first one, then another. He said he would not have been taken, it was not his fault but the corporal\u2019s who had sent him to seize some horsecloths, though he had told him the Russians were there. And at every word he added: \u201cBut don\u2019t hurt my little horse!\u201d and stroked the animal. It was plain that he did not quite grasp where he was. Now he excused himself for having been taken prisoner and now, imagining himself before his own officers, insisted on his soldierly discipline and zeal in the service. He brought with him into our rearguard all the freshness of atmosphere of the French army, which was so alien to us.\n\nThe Cossacks sold the horse for two gold pieces, and Rost\u00f3v, being the richest of the officers now that he had received his money, bought it.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t hurt my little horse!\u201d said the Alsatian good-naturedly to Rost\u00f3v when the animal was handed over to the hussar.\n\nRost\u00f3v smilingly reassured the dragoon and gave him money.\n\n\u201cAlley! Alley!\u201d said the Cossack, touching the prisoner\u2019s arm to make him go on.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor! The Emperor!\u201d was suddenly heard among the hussars.\n\nAll began to run and bustle, and Rost\u00f3v saw coming up the road behind him several riders with white plumes in their hats. In a moment everyone was in his place, waiting.\n\nRost\u00f3v did not know or remember how he ran to his place and mounted. Instantly his regret at not having been in action and his dejected mood amid people of whom he was weary had gone, instantly every thought of himself had vanished. He was filled with happiness at his nearness to the Emperor. He felt that this nearness by itself made up to him for the day he had lost. He was happy as a lover when the longed-for moment of meeting arrives. Not daring to look round and without looking round, he was ecstatically conscious of his approach. He felt it not only from the sound of the hoofs of the approaching cavalcade, but because as he drew near everything grew brighter, more joyful, more significant, and more festive around him. Nearer and nearer to Rost\u00f3v came that sun shedding beams of mild and majestic light around, and already he felt himself enveloped in those beams, he heard his voice, that kindly, calm, and majestic voice that was yet so simple! And as if in accord with Rost\u00f3v\u2019s feeling, there was a deathly stillness amid which was heard the Emperor\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cThe P\u00e1vlograd hussars?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cThe reserves, sire!\u201d replied a voice, a very human one compared to that which had said: \u201cThe P\u00e1vlograd hussars?\u201d\n\nThe Emperor drew level with Rost\u00f3v and halted. Alexander\u2019s face was even more beautiful than it had been three days before at the review. It shone with such gaiety and youth, such innocent youth, that it suggested the liveliness of a fourteen-year-old boy, and yet it was the face of the majestic Emperor. Casually, while surveying the squadron, the Emperor\u2019s eyes met Rost\u00f3v\u2019s and rested on them for not more than two seconds. Whether or no the Emperor understood what was going on in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s soul (it seemed to Rost\u00f3v that he understood everything), at any rate his light-blue eyes gazed for about two seconds into Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face. A gentle, mild light poured from them. Then all at once he raised his eyebrows, abruptly touched his horse with his left foot, and galloped on.\n\nThe younger Emperor could not restrain his wish to be present at the battle and, in spite of the remonstrances of his courtiers, at twelve o\u2019clock left the third column with which he had been and galloped toward the vanguard. Before he came up with the hussars, several adjutants met him with news of the successful result of the action.\n\nThis battle, which consisted in the capture of a French squadron, was represented as a brilliant victory over the French, and so the Emperor and the whole army, especially while the smoke hung over the battlefield, believed that the French had been defeated and were retreating against their will. A few minutes after the Emperor had passed, the P\u00e1vlograd division was ordered to advance. In Wischau itself, a petty German town, Rost\u00f3v saw the Emperor again. In the market place, where there had been some rather heavy firing before the Emperor\u2019s arrival, lay several killed and wounded soldiers whom there had not been time to move. The Emperor, surrounded by his suite of officers and courtiers, was riding a bobtailed chestnut mare, a different one from that which he had ridden at the review, and bending to one side he gracefully held a gold lorgnette to his eyes and looked at a soldier who lay prone, with blood on his uncovered head. The wounded soldier was so dirty, coarse, and revolting that his proximity to the Emperor shocked Rost\u00f3v. Rost\u00f3v saw how the Emperor\u2019s rather round shoulders shuddered as if a cold shiver had run down them, how his left foot began convulsively tapping the horse\u2019s side with the spur, and how the well-trained horse looked round unconcerned and did not stir. An adjutant, dismounting, lifted the soldier under the arms to place him on a stretcher that had been brought. The soldier groaned.\n\n\u201cGently, gently! Can\u2019t you do it more gently?\u201d said the Emperor apparently suffering more than the dying soldier, and he rode away.\n\nRost\u00f3v saw tears filling the Emperor\u2019s eyes and heard him, as he was riding away, say to Czartor\u00fdski: \u201cWhat a terrible thing war is: what a terrible thing! Quelle terrible chose que la guerre!\u201d\n\nThe troops of the vanguard were stationed before Wischau, within sight of the enemy\u2019s lines, which all day long had yielded ground to us at the least firing. The Emperor\u2019s gratitude was announced to the vanguard, rewards were promised, and the men received a double ration of vodka. The campfires crackled and the soldiers\u2019 songs resounded even more merrily than on the previous night. Den\u00edsov celebrated his promotion to the rank of major, and Rost\u00f3v, who had already drunk enough, at the end of the feast proposed the Emperor\u2019s health. \u201cNot \u2018our Sovereign, the Emperor,\u2019 as they say at official dinners,\u201d said he, \u201cbut the health of our Sovereign, that good, enchanting, and great man! Let us drink to his health and to the certain defeat of the French!\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we fought before,\u201d he said, \u201cnot letting the French pass, as at Sch\u00f6n Grabern, what shall we not do now when he is at the front? We will all die for him gladly! Is it not so, gentlemen? Perhaps I am not saying it right, I have drunk a good deal\u2014but that is how I feel, and so do you too! To the health of Alexander the First! Hurrah!\u201d\n\n\u201cHurrah!\u201d rang the enthusiastic voices of the officers.\n\nAnd the old cavalry captain, K\u00edrsten, shouted enthusiastically and no less sincerely than the twenty-year-old Rost\u00f3v.\n\nWhen the officers had emptied and smashed their glasses, K\u00edrsten filled others and, in shirt sleeves and breeches, went glass in hand to the soldiers\u2019 bonfires and with his long gray mustache, his white chest showing under his open shirt, he stood in a majestic pose in the light of the campfire, waving his uplifted arm.\n\n\u201cLads! here\u2019s to our Sovereign, the Emperor, and victory over our enemies! Hurrah!\u201d he exclaimed in his dashing, old, hussar\u2019s baritone.\n\nThe hussars crowded round and responded heartily with loud shouts.\n\nLate that night, when all had separated, Den\u00edsov with his short hand patted his favorite, Rost\u00f3v, on the shoulder.\n\n\u201cAs there\u2019s no one to fall in love with on campaign, he\u2019s fallen in love with the Tsar,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDen\u00edsov, don\u2019t make fun of it!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is such a lofty, beautiful feeling, such a...\u201d\n\n\u201cI believe it, I believe it, fwiend, and I share and appwove...\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you don\u2019t understand!\u201d\n\nAnd Rost\u00f3v got up and went wandering among the campfires, dreaming of what happiness it would be to die\u2014not in saving the Emperor\u2019s life (he did not even dare to dream of that), but simply to die before his eyes. He really was in love with the Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms and the hope of future triumph. And he was not the only man to experience that feeling during those memorable days preceding the battle of Austerlitz: nine tenths of the men in the Russian army were then in love, though less ecstatically, with their Tsar and the glory of the Russian arms.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe next day the Emperor stopped at Wischau, and Villier, his physician, was repeatedly summoned to see him. At headquarters and among the troops near by the news spread that the Emperor was unwell. He ate nothing and had slept badly that night, those around him reported. The cause of this indisposition was the strong impression made on his sensitive mind by the sight of the killed and wounded.\n\nAt daybreak on the seventeenth, a French officer who had come with a flag of truce, demanding an audience with the Russian Emperor, was brought into Wischau from our outposts. This officer was Savary. The Emperor had only just fallen asleep and so Savary had to wait. At midday he was admitted to the Emperor, and an hour later he rode off with Prince Dolgor\u00fakov to the advanced post of the French army.\n\nIt was rumored that Savary had been sent to propose to Alexander a meeting with Napoleon. To the joy and pride of the whole army, a personal interview was refused, and instead of the Sovereign, Prince Dolgor\u00fakov, the victor at Wischau, was sent with Savary to negotiate with Napoleon if, contrary to expectations, these negotiations were actuated by a real desire for peace.\n\nToward evening Dolgor\u00fakov came back, went straight to the Tsar, and remained alone with him for a long time.\n\nOn the eighteenth and nineteenth of November, the army advanced two days\u2019 march and the enemy\u2019s outposts after a brief interchange of shots retreated. In the highest army circles from midday on the nineteenth, a great, excitedly bustling activity began which lasted till the morning of the twentieth, when the memorable battle of Austerlitz was fought.\n\nTill midday on the nineteenth, the activity\u2014the eager talk, running to and fro, and dispatching of adjutants\u2014was confined to the Emperor\u2019s headquarters. But on the afternoon of that day, this activity reached Kut\u00fazov\u2019s headquarters and the staffs of the commanders of columns. By evening, the adjutants had spread it to all ends and parts of the army, and in the night from the nineteenth to the twentieth, the whole eighty thousand allied troops rose from their bivouacs to the hum of voices, and the army swayed and started in one enormous mass six miles long.\n\nThe concentrated activity which had begun at the Emperor\u2019s headquarters in the morning and had started the whole movement that followed was like the first movement of the main wheel of a large tower clock. One wheel slowly moved, another was set in motion, and a third, and wheels began to revolve faster and faster, levers and cogwheels to work, chimes to play, figures to pop out, and the hands to advance with regular motion as a result of all that activity.\n\nJust as in the mechanism of a clock, so in the mechanism of the military machine, an impulse once given leads to the final result; and just as indifferently quiescent till the moment when motion is transmitted to them are the parts of the mechanism which the impulse has not yet reached. Wheels creak on their axles as the cogs engage one another and the revolving pulleys whirr with the rapidity of their movement, but a neighboring wheel is as quiet and motionless as though it were prepared to remain so for a hundred years; but the moment comes when the lever catches it and obeying the impulse that wheel begins to creak and joins in the common motion the result and aim of which are beyond its ken.\n\nJust as in a clock, the result of the complicated motion of innumerable wheels and pulleys is merely a slow and regular movement of the hands which show the time, so the result of all the complicated human activities of 160,000 Russians and French\u2014all their passions, desires, remorse, humiliations, sufferings, outbursts of pride, fear, and enthusiasm\u2014was only the loss of the battle of Austerlitz, the so-called battle of the three Emperors\u2014that is to say, a slow movement of the hand on the dial of human history.\n\nPrince Andrew was on duty that day and in constant attendance on the commander in chief.\n\nAt six in the evening, Kut\u00fazov went to the Emperor\u2019s headquarters and after staying but a short time with the Tsar went to see the grand marshal of the court, Count Tolst\u00f3y.\n\nBolk\u00f3nski took the opportunity to go in to get some details of the coming action from Dolgor\u00fakov. He felt that Kut\u00fazov was upset and dissatisfied about something and that at headquarters they were dissatisfied with him, and also that at the Emperor\u2019s headquarters everyone adopted toward him the tone of men who know something others do not know: he therefore wished to speak to Dolgor\u00fakov.\n\n\u201cWell, how d\u2019you do, my dear fellow?\u201d said Dolgor\u00fakov, who was sitting at tea with Bil\u00edbin. \u201cThe fete is for tomorrow. How is your old fellow? Out of sorts?\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t say he is out of sorts, but I fancy he would like to be heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they heard him at the council of war and will hear him when he talks sense, but to temporize and wait for something now when Bonaparte fears nothing so much as a general battle is impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you have seen him?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, what is Bonaparte like? How did he impress you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I saw him, and am convinced that he fears nothing so much as a general engagement,\u201d repeated Dolgor\u00fakov, evidently prizing this general conclusion which he had arrived at from his interview with Napoleon. \u201cIf he weren\u2019t afraid of a battle why did he ask for that interview? Why negotiate, and above all why retreat, when to retreat is so contrary to his method of conducting war? Believe me, he is afraid, afraid of a general battle. His hour has come! Mark my words!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut tell me, what is he like, eh?\u201d said Prince Andrew again.\n\n\u201cHe is a man in a gray overcoat, very anxious that I should call him \u2018Your Majesty,\u2019 but who, to his chagrin, got no title from me! That\u2019s the sort of man he is, and nothing more,\u201d replied Dolgor\u00fakov, looking round at Bil\u00edbin with a smile.\n\n\u201cDespite my great respect for old Kut\u00fazov,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe should be a nice set of fellows if we were to wait about and so give him a chance to escape, or to trick us, now that we certainly have him in our hands! No, we mustn\u2019t forget Suv\u00f3rov and his rule\u2014not to put yourself in a position to be attacked, but yourself to attack. Believe me in war the energy of young men often shows the way better than all the experience of old Cunctators.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in what position are we going to attack him? I have been at the outposts today and it is impossible to say where his chief forces are situated,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\nHe wished to explain to Dolgor\u00fakov a plan of attack he had himself formed.\n\n\u201cOh, that is all the same,\u201d Dolgor\u00fakov said quickly, and getting up he spread a map on the table. \u201cAll eventualities have been foreseen. If he is standing before Br\u00fcnn...\u201d\n\nAnd Prince Dolgor\u00fakov rapidly but indistinctly explained Weyrother\u2019s plan of a flanking movement.\n\nPrince Andrew began to reply and to state his own plan, which might have been as good as Weyrother\u2019s, but for the disadvantage that Weyrother\u2019s had already been approved. As soon as Prince Andrew began to demonstrate the defects of the latter and the merits of his own plan, Prince Dolgor\u00fakov ceased to listen to him and gazed absent-mindedly not at the map, but at Prince Andrew\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cThere will be a council of war at Kut\u00fazov\u2019s tonight, though; you can say all this there,\u201d remarked Dolgor\u00fakov.\n\n\u201cI will do so,\u201d said Prince Andrew, moving away from the map.\n\n\u201cWhatever are you bothering about, gentlemen?\u201d said Bil\u00edbin, who, till then, had listened with an amused smile to their conversation and now was evidently ready with a joke. \u201cWhether tomorrow brings victory or defeat, the glory of our Russian arms is secure. Except your Kut\u00fazov, there is not a single Russian in command of a column! The commanders are: Herr General Wimpfen, le Comte de Langeron, le Prince de Lichtenstein, le Prince de Hohenlohe, and finally Prishprish, and so on like all those Polish names.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, backbiter!\u201d said Dolgor\u00fakov. \u201cIt is not true; there are now two Russians, Milor\u00e1dovich, and Dokht\u00farov, and there would be a third, Count Arakch\u00e9ev, if his nerves were not too weak.\u201d\n\n\u201cHowever, I think General Kut\u00fazov has come out,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cI wish you good luck and success, gentlemen!\u201d he added and went out after shaking hands with Dolgor\u00fakov and Bil\u00edbin.\n\nOn the way home, Prince Andrew could not refrain from asking Kut\u00fazov, who was sitting silently beside him, what he thought of tomorrow\u2019s battle.\n\nKut\u00fazov looked sternly at his adjutant and, after a pause, replied: \u201cI think the battle will be lost, and so I told Count Tolst\u00f3y and asked him to tell the Emperor. What do you think he replied? \u2018But, my dear general, I am engaged with rice and cutlets, look after military matters yourself!\u2019 Yes... That was the answer I got!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nShortly after nine o\u2019clock that evening, Weyrother drove with his plans to Kut\u00fazov\u2019s quarters where the council of war was to be held. All the commanders of columns were summoned to the commander in chief\u2019s and with the exception of Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, who declined to come, were all there at the appointed time.\n\nWeyrother, who was in full control of the proposed battle, by his eagerness and briskness presented a marked contrast to the dissatisfied and drowsy Kut\u00fazov, who reluctantly played the part of chairman and president of the council of war. Weyrother evidently felt himself to be at the head of a movement that had already become unrestrainable. He was like a horse running downhill harnessed to a heavy cart. Whether he was pulling it or being pushed by it he did not know, but rushed along at headlong speed with no time to consider what this movement might lead to. Weyrother had been twice that evening to the enemy\u2019s picket line to reconnoiter personally, and twice to the Emperors, Russian and Austrian, to report and explain, and to his headquarters where he had dictated the dispositions in German, and now, much exhausted, he arrived at Kut\u00fazov\u2019s.\n\nHe was evidently so busy that he even forgot to be polite to the commander in chief. He interrupted him, talked rapidly and indistinctly, without looking at the man he was addressing, and did not reply to questions put to him. He was bespattered with mud and had a pitiful, weary, and distracted air, though at the same time he was haughty and self-confident.\n\nKut\u00fazov was occupying a nobleman\u2019s castle of modest dimensions near Ostralitz. In the large drawing room which had become the commander in chief\u2019s office were gathered Kut\u00fazov himself, Weyrother, and the members of the council of war. They were drinking tea, and only awaited Prince Bagrati\u00f3n to begin the council. At last Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s orderly came with the news that the prince could not attend. Prince Andrew came in to inform the commander in chief of this and, availing himself of permission previously given him by Kut\u00fazov to be present at the council, he remained in the room.\n\n\u201cSince Prince Bagrati\u00f3n is not coming, we may begin,\u201d said Weyrother, hurriedly rising from his seat and going up to the table on which an enormous map of the environs of Br\u00fcnn was spread out.\n\nKut\u00fazov, with his uniform unbuttoned so that his fat neck bulged over his collar as if escaping, was sitting almost asleep in a low chair, with his podgy old hands resting symmetrically on its arms. At the sound of Weyrother\u2019s voice, he opened his one eye with an effort.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, if you please! It is already late,\u201d said he, and nodding his head he let it droop and again closed his eye.\n\nIf at first the members of the council thought that Kut\u00fazov was pretending to sleep, the sounds his nose emitted during the reading that followed proved that the commander in chief at that moment was absorbed by a far more serious matter than a desire to show his contempt for the dispositions or anything else\u2014he was engaged in satisfying the irresistible human need for sleep. He really was asleep. Weyrother, with the gesture of a man too busy to lose a moment, glanced at Kut\u00fazov and, having convinced himself that he was asleep, took up a paper and in a loud, monotonous voice began to read out the dispositions for the impending battle, under a heading which he also read out:\n\n\u201cDispositions for an attack on the enemy position behind Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz, November 30, 1805.\u201d\n\nThe dispositions were very complicated and difficult. They began as follows:\n\n\u201cAs the enemy\u2019s left wing rests on wooded hills and his right extends along Kobelnitz and Sokolnitz behind the ponds that are there, while we, on the other hand, with our left wing by far outflank his right, it is advantageous to attack the enemy\u2019s latter wing especially if we occupy the villages of Sokolnitz and Kobelnitz, whereby we can both fall on his flank and pursue him over the plain between Schlappanitz and the Thuerassa forest, avoiding the defiles of Schlappanitz and Bellowitz which cover the enemy\u2019s front. For this object it is necessary that... The first column marches... The second column marches... The third column marches...\u201d and so on, read Weyrother.\n\nThe generals seemed to listen reluctantly to the difficult dispositions. The tall, fair-haired General Buxh\u00f6wden stood, leaning his back against the wall, his eyes fixed on a burning candle, and seemed not to listen or even to wish to be thought to listen. Exactly opposite Weyrother, with his glistening wide-open eyes fixed upon him and his mustache twisted upwards, sat the ruddy Milor\u00e1dovich in a military pose, his elbows turned outwards, his hands on his knees, and his shoulders raised. He remained stubbornly silent, gazing at Weyrother\u2019s face, and only turned away his eyes when the Austrian chief of staff finished reading. Then Milor\u00e1dovich looked round significantly at the other generals. But one could not tell from that significant look whether he agreed or disagreed and was satisfied or not with the arrangements. Next to Weyrother sat Count Langeron who, with a subtle smile that never left his typically southern French face during the whole time of the reading, gazed at his delicate fingers which rapidly twirled by its corners a gold snuffbox on which was a portrait. In the middle of one of the longest sentences, he stopped the rotary motion of the snuffbox, raised his head, and with inimical politeness lurking in the corners of his thin lips interrupted Weyrother, wishing to say something. But the Austrian general, continuing to read, frowned angrily and jerked his elbows, as if to say: \u201cYou can tell me your views later, but now be so good as to look at the map and listen.\u201d Langeron lifted his eyes with an expression of perplexity, turned round to Milor\u00e1dovich as if seeking an explanation, but meeting the latter\u2019s impressive but meaningless gaze drooped his eyes sadly and again took to twirling his snuffbox.\n\n\u201cA geography lesson!\u201d he muttered as if to himself, but loud enough to be heard.\n\nPrzebysz\u00e9wski, with respectful but dignified politeness, held his hand to his ear toward Weyrother, with the air of a man absorbed in attention. Dohkt\u00farov, a little man, sat opposite Weyrother, with an assiduous and modest mien, and stooping over the outspread map conscientiously studied the dispositions and the unfamiliar locality. He asked Weyrother several times to repeat words he had not clearly heard and the difficult names of villages. Weyrother complied and Dohkt\u00farov noted them down.\n\nWhen the reading which lasted more than an hour was over, Langeron again brought his snuffbox to rest and, without looking at Weyrother or at anyone in particular, began to say how difficult it was to carry out such a plan in which the enemy\u2019s position was assumed to be known, whereas it was perhaps not known, since the enemy was in movement. Langeron\u2019s objections were valid but it was obvious that their chief aim was to show General Weyrother\u2014who had read his dispositions with as much self-confidence as if he were addressing school children\u2014that he had to do, not with fools, but with men who could teach him something in military matters.\n\nWhen the monotonous sound of Weyrother\u2019s voice ceased, Kut\u00fazov opened his eye as a miller wakes up when the soporific drone of the mill wheel is interrupted. He listened to what Langeron said, as if remarking, \u201cSo you are still at that silly business!\u201d quickly closed his eye again, and let his head sink still lower.\n\nLangeron, trying as virulently as possible to sting Weyrother\u2019s vanity as author of the military plan, argued that Bonaparte might easily attack instead of being attacked, and so render the whole of this plan perfectly worthless. Weyrother met all objections with a firm and contemptuous smile, evidently prepared beforehand to meet all objections be they what they might.\n\n\u201cIf he could attack us, he would have done so today,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cSo you think he is powerless?\u201d said Langeron.\n\n\u201cHe has forty thousand men at most,\u201d replied Weyrother, with the smile of a doctor to whom an old wife wishes to explain the treatment of a case.\n\n\u201cIn that case he is inviting his doom by awaiting our attack,\u201d said Langeron, with a subtly ironical smile, again glancing round for support to Milor\u00e1dovich who was near him.\n\nBut Milor\u00e1dovich was at that moment evidently thinking of anything rather than of what the generals were disputing about.\n\n\u201cMa foi!\u201d said he, \u201ctomorrow we shall see all that on the battlefield.\u201d\n\nWeyrother again gave that smile which seemed to say that to him it was strange and ridiculous to meet objections from Russian generals and to have to prove to them what he had not merely convinced himself of, but had also convinced the sovereign Emperors of.\n\n\u201cThe enemy has quenched his fires and a continual noise is heard from his camp,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat does that mean? Either he is retreating, which is the only thing we need fear, or he is changing his position.\u201d (He smiled ironically.) \u201cBut even if he also took up a position in the Thuerassa, he merely saves us a great deal of trouble and all our arrangements to the minutest detail remain the same.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that?...\u201d began Prince Andrew, who had for long been waiting an opportunity to express his doubts.\n\nKut\u00fazov here woke up, coughed heavily, and looked round at the generals.\n\n\u201cGentlemen, the dispositions for tomorrow\u2014or rather for today, for it is past midnight\u2014cannot now be altered,\u201d said he. \u201cYou have heard them, and we shall all do our duty. But before a battle, there is nothing more important...\u201d he paused, \u201cthan to have a good sleep.\u201d\n\nHe moved as if to rise. The generals bowed and retired. It was past midnight. Prince Andrew went out.\n\nThe council of war, at which Prince Andrew had not been able to express his opinion as he had hoped to, left on him a vague and uneasy impression. Whether Dolgor\u00fakov and Weyrother, or Kut\u00fazov, Langeron, and the others who did not approve of the plan of attack, were right\u2014he did not know. \u201cBut was it really not possible for Kut\u00fazov to state his views plainly to the Emperor? Is it possible that on account of court and personal considerations tens of thousands of lives, and my life, my life,\u201d he thought, \u201cmust be risked?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is very likely that I shall be killed tomorrow,\u201d he thought. And suddenly, at this thought of death, a whole series of most distant, most intimate, memories rose in his imagination: he remembered his last parting from his father and his wife; he remembered the days when he first loved her. He thought of her pregnancy and felt sorry for her and for himself, and in a nervously emotional and softened mood he went out of the hut in which he was billeted with Nesv\u00edtski and began to walk up and down before it.\n\nThe night was foggy and through the fog the moonlight gleamed mysteriously. \u201cYes, tomorrow, tomorrow!\u201d he thought. \u201cTomorrow everything may be over for me! All these memories will be no more, none of them will have any meaning for me. Tomorrow perhaps, even certainly, I have a presentiment that for the first time I shall have to show all I can do.\u201d And his fancy pictured the battle, its loss, the concentration of fighting at one point, and the hesitation of all the commanders. And then that happy moment, that Toulon for which he had so long waited, presents itself to him at last. He firmly and clearly expresses his opinion to Kut\u00fazov, to Weyrother, and to the Emperors. All are struck by the justness of his views, but no one undertakes to carry them out, so he takes a regiment, a division\u2014stipulates that no one is to interfere with his arrangements\u2014leads his division to the decisive point, and gains the victory alone. \u201cBut death and suffering?\u201d suggested another voice. Prince Andrew, however, did not answer that voice and went on dreaming of his triumphs. The dispositions for the next battle are planned by him alone. Nominally he is only an adjutant on Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff, but he does everything alone. The next battle is won by him alone. Kut\u00fazov is removed and he is appointed... \u201cWell and then?\u201d asked the other voice. \u201cIf before that you are not ten times wounded, killed, or betrayed, well... what then?...\u201d \u201cWell then,\u201d Prince Andrew answered himself, \u201cI don\u2019t know what will happen and don\u2019t want to know, and can\u2019t, but if I want this\u2014want glory, want to be known to men, want to be loved by them, it is not my fault that I want it and want nothing but that and live only for that. Yes, for that alone! I shall never tell anyone, but, oh God! what am I to do if I love nothing but fame and men\u2019s esteem? Death, wounds, the loss of family\u2014I fear nothing. And precious and dear as many persons are to me\u2014father, sister, wife\u2014those dearest to me\u2014yet dreadful and unnatural as it seems, I would give them all at once for a moment of glory, of triumph over men, of love from men I don\u2019t know and never shall know, for the love of these men here,\u201d he thought, as he listened to voices in Kut\u00fazov\u2019s courtyard. The voices were those of the orderlies who were packing up; one voice, probably a coachman\u2019s, was teasing Kut\u00fazov\u2019s old cook whom Prince Andrew knew, and who was called Tit. He was saying, \u201cTit, I say, Tit!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d returned the old man.\n\n\u201cGo, Tit, thresh a bit!\u201d said the wag.\n\n\u201cOh, go to the devil!\u201d called out a voice, drowned by the laughter of the orderlies and servants.\n\n\u201cAll the same, I love and value nothing but triumph over them all, I value this mystic power and glory that is floating here above me in this mist!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThat same night, Rost\u00f3v was with a platoon on skirmishing duty in front of Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s detachment. His hussars were placed along the line in couples and he himself rode along the line trying to master the sleepiness that kept coming over him. An enormous space, with our army\u2019s campfires dimly glowing in the fog, could be seen behind him; in front of him was misty darkness. Rost\u00f3v could see nothing, peer as he would into that foggy distance: now something gleamed gray, now there was something black, now little lights seemed to glimmer where the enemy ought to be, now he fancied it was only something in his own eyes. His eyes kept closing, and in his fancy appeared\u2014now the Emperor, now Den\u00edsov, and now Moscow memories\u2014and he again hurriedly opened his eyes and saw close before him the head and ears of the horse he was riding, and sometimes, when he came within six paces of them, the black figures of hussars, but in the distance was still the same misty darkness. \u201cWhy not?... It might easily happen,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, \u201cthat the Emperor will meet me and give me an order as he would to any other officer; he\u2019ll say: \u2018Go and find out what\u2019s there.\u2019 There are many stories of his getting to know an officer in just such a chance way and attaching him to himself! What if he gave me a place near him? Oh, how I would guard him, how I would tell him the truth, how I would unmask his deceivers!\u201d And in order to realize vividly his love devotion to the sovereign, Rost\u00f3v pictured to himself an enemy or a deceitful German, whom he would not only kill with pleasure but whom he would slap in the face before the Emperor. Suddenly a distant shout aroused him. He started and opened his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhere am I? Oh yes, in the skirmishing line... pass and watchword\u2014shaft, Olm\u00fctz. What a nuisance that our squadron will be in reserve tomorrow,\u201d he thought. \u201cI\u2019ll ask leave to go to the front, this may be my only chance of seeing the Emperor. It won\u2019t be long now before I am off duty. I\u2019ll take another turn and when I get back I\u2019ll go to the general and ask him.\u201d He readjusted himself in the saddle and touched up his horse to ride once more round his hussars. It seemed to him that it was getting lighter. To the left he saw a sloping descent lit up, and facing it a black knoll that seemed as steep as a wall. On this knoll there was a white patch that Rost\u00f3v could not at all make out: was it a glade in the wood lit up by the moon, or some unmelted snow, or some white houses? He even thought something moved on that white spot. \u201cI expect it\u2019s snow... that spot... a spot\u2014une tache,\u201d he thought. \u201cThere now... it\u2019s not a tache... Nat\u00e1sha... sister, black eyes... Na... tasha... (Won\u2019t she be surprised when I tell her how I\u2019ve seen the Emperor?) Nat\u00e1sha... take my sabretache...\u201d\u2014\u201cKeep to the right, your honor, there are bushes here,\u201d came the voice of an hussar, past whom Rost\u00f3v was riding in the act of falling asleep. Rost\u00f3v lifted his head that had sunk almost to his horse\u2019s mane and pulled up beside the hussar. He was succumbing to irresistible, youthful, childish drowsiness. \u201cBut what was I thinking? I mustn\u2019t forget. How shall I speak to the Emperor? No, that\u2019s not it\u2014that\u2019s tomorrow. Oh yes! Nat\u00e1sha... sabretache... saber them... Whom? The hussars... Ah, the hussars with mustaches. Along the Tversk\u00e1ya Street rode the hussar with mustaches... I thought about him too, just opposite G\u00faryev\u2019s house... Old G\u00faryev.... Oh, but Den\u00edsov\u2019s a fine fellow. But that\u2019s all nonsense. The chief thing is that the Emperor is here. How he looked at me and wished to say something, but dared not.... No, it was I who dared not. But that\u2019s nonsense, the chief thing is not to forget the important thing I was thinking of. Yes, Na-t\u00e1sha, sabretache, oh, yes, yes! That\u2019s right!\u201d And his head once more sank to his horse\u2019s neck. All at once it seemed to him that he was being fired at. \u201cWhat? What? What?... Cut them down! What?...\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, waking up. At the moment he opened his eyes he heard in front of him, where the enemy was, the long-drawn shouts of thousands of voices. His horse and the horse of the hussar near him pricked their ears at these shouts. Over there, where the shouting came from, a fire flared up and went out again, then another, and all along the French line on the hill fires flared up and the shouting grew louder and louder. Rost\u00f3v could hear the sound of French words but could not distinguish them. The din of many voices was too great; all he could hear was: \u201cahahah!\u201d and \u201crrrr!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s that? What do you make of it?\u201d said Rost\u00f3v to the hussar beside him. \u201cThat must be the enemy\u2019s camp!\u201d\n\nThe hussar did not reply.\n\n\u201cWhy, don\u2019t you hear it?\u201d Rost\u00f3v asked again, after waiting for a reply.\n\n\u201cWho can tell, your honor?\u201d replied the hussar reluctantly.\n\n\u201cFrom the direction, it must be the enemy,\u201d repeated Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cIt may be he or it may be nothing,\u201d muttered the hussar. \u201cIt\u2019s dark... Steady!\u201d he cried to his fidgeting horse.\n\nRost\u00f3v\u2019s horse was also getting restive: it pawed the frozen ground, pricking its ears at the noise and looking at the lights. The shouting grew still louder and merged into a general roar that only an army of several thousand men could produce. The lights spread farther and farther, probably along the line of the French camp. Rost\u00f3v no longer wanted to sleep. The gay triumphant shouting of the enemy army had a stimulating effect on him. \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur! l\u2019Empereur!\u201d he now heard distinctly.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t be far off, probably just beyond the stream,\u201d he said to the hussar beside him.\n\nThe hussar only sighed without replying and coughed angrily. The sound of horse\u2019s hoofs approaching at a trot along the line of hussars was heard, and out of the foggy darkness the figure of a sergeant of hussars suddenly appeared, looming huge as an elephant.\n\n\u201cYour honor, the generals!\u201d said the sergeant, riding up to Rost\u00f3v.\n\nRost\u00f3v, still looking round toward the fires and the shouts, rode with the sergeant to meet some mounted men who were riding along the line. One was on a white horse. Prince Bagrati\u00f3n and Prince Dolgor\u00fakov with their adjutants had come to witness the curious phenomenon of the lights and shouts in the enemy\u2019s camp. Rost\u00f3v rode up to Bagrati\u00f3n, reported to him, and then joined the adjutants listening to what the generals were saying.\n\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d said Prince Dolgor\u00fakov, addressing Bagrati\u00f3n, \u201cit is nothing but a trick! He has retreated and ordered the rearguard to kindle fires and make a noise to deceive us.\u201d\n\n\u201cHardly,\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n. \u201cI saw them this evening on that knoll; if they had retreated they would have withdrawn from that too.... Officer!\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n to Rost\u00f3v, \u201care the enemy\u2019s skirmishers still there?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were there this evening, but now I don\u2019t know, your excellency. Shall I go with some of my hussars to see?\u201d replied Rost\u00f3v.\n\nBagrati\u00f3n stopped and, before replying, tried to see Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face in the mist.\n\n\u201cWell, go and see,\u201d he said, after a pause.\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v spurred his horse, called to Sergeant F\u00e9dchenko and two other hussars, told them to follow him, and trotted downhill in the direction from which the shouting came. He felt both frightened and pleased to be riding alone with three hussars into that mysterious and dangerous misty distance where no one had been before him. Bagrati\u00f3n called to him from the hill not to go beyond the stream, but Rost\u00f3v pretended not to hear him and did not stop but rode on and on, continually mistaking bushes for trees and gullies for men and continually discovering his mistakes. Having descended the hill at a trot, he no longer saw either our own or the enemy\u2019s fires, but heard the shouting of the French more loudly and distinctly. In the valley he saw before him something like a river, but when he reached it he found it was a road. Having come out onto the road he reined in his horse, hesitating whether to ride along it or cross it and ride over the black field up the hillside. To keep to the road which gleamed white in the mist would have been safer because it would be easier to see people coming along it. \u201cFollow me!\u201d said he, crossed the road, and began riding up the hill at a gallop toward the point where the French pickets had been standing that evening.\n\n\u201cYour honor, there he is!\u201d cried one of the hussars behind him. And before Rost\u00f3v had time to make out what the black thing was that had suddenly appeared in the fog, there was a flash, followed by a report, and a bullet whizzing high up in the mist with a plaintive sound passed out of hearing. Another musket missed fire but flashed in the pan. Rost\u00f3v turned his horse and galloped back. Four more reports followed at intervals, and the bullets passed somewhere in the fog singing in different tones. Rost\u00f3v reined in his horse, whose spirits had risen, like his own, at the firing, and went back at a footpace. \u201cWell, some more! Some more!\u201d a merry voice was saying in his soul. But no more shots came.\n\nOnly when approaching Bagrati\u00f3n did Rost\u00f3v let his horse gallop again, and with his hand at the salute rode up to the general.\n\nDolgor\u00fakov was still insisting that the French had retreated and had only lit fires to deceive us.\n\n\u201cWhat does that prove?\u201d he was saying as Rost\u00f3v rode up. \u201cThey might retreat and leave the pickets.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s plain that they have not all gone yet, Prince,\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n. \u201cWait till tomorrow morning, we\u2019ll find out everything tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe picket is still on the hill, your excellency, just where it was in the evening,\u201d reported Rost\u00f3v, stooping forward with his hand at the salute and unable to repress the smile of delight induced by his ride and especially by the sound of the bullets.\n\n\u201cVery good, very good,\u201d said Bagrati\u00f3n. \u201cThank you, officer.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour excellency,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, \u201cmay I ask a favor?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow our squadron is to be in reserve. May I ask to be attached to the first squadron?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cCount Rost\u00f3v.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very well, you may stay in attendance on me.\u201d\n\n\u201cCount Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v\u2019s son?\u201d asked Dolgor\u00fakov.\n\nBut Rost\u00f3v did not reply.\n\n\u201cThen I may reckon on it, your excellency?\u201d\n\n\u201cI will give the order.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow very likely I may be sent with some message to the Emperor,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d\n\nThe fires and shouting in the enemy\u2019s army were occasioned by the fact that while Napoleon\u2019s proclamation was being read to the troops the Emperor himself rode round his bivouacs. The soldiers, on seeing him, lit wisps of straw and ran after him, shouting, \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d Napoleon\u2019s proclamation was as follows:\n\nSoldiers! The Russian army is advancing against you to avenge the Austrian army of Ulm. They are the same battalions you broke at Hollabr\u00fcnn and have pursued ever since to this place. The position we occupy is a strong one, and while they are marching to go round me on the right they will expose a flank to me. Soldiers! I will myself direct your battalions. I will keep out of fire if you with your habitual valor carry disorder and confusion into the enemy\u2019s ranks, but should victory be in doubt, even for a moment, you will see your Emperor exposing himself to the first blows of the enemy, for there must be no doubt of victory, especially on this day when what is at stake is the honor of the French infantry, so necessary to the honor of our nation.\n\nDo not break your ranks on the plea of removing the wounded! Let every man be fully imbued with the thought that we must defeat these hirelings of England, inspired by such hatred of our nation! This victory will conclude our campaign and we can return to winter quarters, where fresh French troops who are being raised in France will join us, and the peace I shall conclude will be worthy of my people, of you, and of myself.\n\nNAPOLEON\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAt five in the morning it was still quite dark. The troops of the center, the reserves, and Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s right flank had not yet moved, but on the left flank the columns of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, which were to be the first to descend the heights to attack the French right flank and drive it into the Bohemian mountains according to plan, were already up and astir. The smoke of the campfires, into which they were throwing everything superfluous, made the eyes smart. It was cold and dark. The officers were hurriedly drinking tea and breakfasting, the soldiers, munching biscuit and beating a tattoo with their feet to warm themselves, gathering round the fires throwing into the flames the remains of sheds, chairs, tables, wheels, tubs, and everything that they did not want or could not carry away with them. Austrian column guides were moving in and out among the Russian troops and served as heralds of the advance. As soon as an Austrian officer showed himself near a commanding officer\u2019s quarters, the regiment began to move: the soldiers ran from the fires, thrust their pipes into their boots, their bags into the carts, got their muskets ready, and formed rank. The officers buttoned up their coats, buckled on their swords and pouches, and moved along the ranks shouting. The train drivers and orderlies harnessed and packed the wagons and tied on the loads. The adjutants and battalion and regimental commanders mounted, crossed themselves, gave final instructions, orders, and commissions to the baggage men who remained behind, and the monotonous tramp of thousands of feet resounded. The column moved forward without knowing where and unable, from the masses around them, the smoke and the increasing fog, to see either the place they were leaving or that to which they were going.\n\nA soldier on the march is hemmed in and borne along by his regiment as much as a sailor is by his ship. However far he has walked, whatever strange, unknown, and dangerous places he reaches, just as a sailor is always surrounded by the same decks, masts, and rigging of his ship, so the soldier always has around him the same comrades, the same ranks, the same sergeant major Iv\u00e1n M\u00edtrich, the same company dog Jack, and the same commanders. The sailor rarely cares to know the latitude in which his ship is sailing, but on the day of battle\u2014heaven knows how and whence\u2014a stern note of which all are conscious sounds in the moral atmosphere of an army, announcing the approach of something decisive and solemn, and awakening in the men an unusual curiosity. On the day of battle the soldiers excitedly try to get beyond the interests of their regiment, they listen intently, look about, and eagerly ask concerning what is going on around them.\n\nThe fog had grown so dense that though it was growing light they could not see ten paces ahead. Bushes looked like gigantic trees and level ground like cliffs and slopes. Anywhere, on any side, one might encounter an enemy invisible ten paces off. But the columns advanced for a long time, always in the same fog, descending and ascending hills, avoiding gardens and enclosures, going over new and unknown ground, and nowhere encountering the enemy. On the contrary, the soldiers became aware that in front, behind, and on all sides, other Russian columns were moving in the same direction. Every soldier felt glad to know that to the unknown place where he was going, many more of our men were going too.\n\n\u201cThere now, the K\u00farskies have also gone past,\u201d was being said in the ranks.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s wonderful what a lot of our troops have gathered, lads! Last night I looked at the campfires and there was no end of them. A regular Moscow!\u201d\n\nThough none of the column commanders rode up to the ranks or talked to the men (the commanders, as we saw at the council of war, were out of humor and dissatisfied with the affair, and so did not exert themselves to cheer the men but merely carried out the orders), yet the troops marched gaily, as they always do when going into action, especially to an attack. But when they had marched for about an hour in the dense fog, the greater part of the men had to halt and an unpleasant consciousness of some dislocation and blunder spread through the ranks. How such a consciousness is communicated is very difficult to define, but it certainly is communicated very surely, and flows rapidly, imperceptibly, and irrepressibly, as water does in a creek. Had the Russian army been alone without any allies, it might perhaps have been a long time before this consciousness of mismanagement became a general conviction, but as it was, the disorder was readily and naturally attributed to the stupid Germans, and everyone was convinced that a dangerous muddle had been occasioned by the sausage eaters.\n\n\u201cWhy have we stopped? Is the way blocked? Or have we already come up against the French?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, one can\u2019t hear them. They\u2019d be firing if we had.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey were in a hurry enough to start us, and now here we stand in the middle of a field without rhyme or reason. It\u2019s all those damned Germans\u2019 muddling! What stupid devils!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019d send them on in front, but no fear, they\u2019re crowding up behind. And now here we stand hungry.\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, shall we soon be clear? They say the cavalry are blocking the way,\u201d said an officer.\n\n\u201cAh, those damned Germans! They don\u2019t know their own country!\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cWhat division are you?\u201d shouted an adjutant, riding up.\n\n\u201cThe Eighteenth.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you here? You should have gone on long ago, now you won\u2019t get there till evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat stupid orders! They don\u2019t themselves know what they are doing!\u201d said the officer and rode off.\n\nThen a general rode past shouting something angrily, not in Russian.\n\n\u201cTafa-lafa! But what he\u2019s jabbering no one can make out,\u201d said a soldier, mimicking the general who had ridden away. \u201cI\u2019d shoot them, the scoundrels!\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were ordered to be at the place before nine, but we haven\u2019t got halfway. Fine orders!\u201d was being repeated on different sides.\n\nAnd the feeling of energy with which the troops had started began to turn into vexation and anger at the stupid arrangements and at the Germans.\n\nThe cause of the confusion was that while the Austrian cavalry was moving toward our left flank, the higher command found that our center was too far separated from our right flank and the cavalry were all ordered to turn back to the right. Several thousand cavalry crossed in front of the infantry, who had to wait.\n\nAt the front an altercation occurred between an Austrian guide and a Russian general. The general shouted a demand that the cavalry should be halted, the Austrian argued that not he, but the higher command, was to blame. The troops meanwhile stood growing listless and dispirited. After an hour\u2019s delay they at last moved on, descending the hill. The fog that was dispersing on the hill lay still more densely below, where they were descending. In front in the fog a shot was heard and then another, at first irregularly at varying intervals\u2014trata...tat\u2014and then more and more regularly and rapidly, and the action at the Goldbach Stream began.\n\nNot expecting to come on the enemy down by the stream, and having stumbled on him in the fog, hearing no encouraging word from their commanders, and with a consciousness of being too late spreading through the ranks, and above all being unable to see anything in front or around them in the thick fog, the Russians exchanged shots with the enemy lazily and advanced and again halted, receiving no timely orders from the officers or adjutants who wandered about in the fog in those unknown surroundings unable to find their own regiments. In this way the action began for the first, second, and third columns, which had gone down into the valley. The fourth column, with which Kut\u00fazov was, stood on the Pratzen Heights.\n\nBelow, where the fight was beginning, there was still thick fog; on the higher ground it was clearing, but nothing could be seen of what was going on in front. Whether all the enemy forces were, as we supposed, six miles away, or whether they were near by in that sea of mist, no one knew till after eight o\u2019clock.\n\nIt was nine o\u2019clock in the morning. The fog lay unbroken like a sea down below, but higher up at the village of Schlappanitz where Napoleon stood with his marshals around him, it was quite light. Above him was a clear blue sky, and the sun\u2019s vast orb quivered like a huge hollow, crimson float on the surface of that milky sea of mist. The whole French army, and even Napoleon himself with his staff, were not on the far side of the streams and hollows of Sokolnitz and Schlappanitz beyond which we intended to take up our position and begin the action, but were on this side, so close to our own forces that Napoleon with the naked eye could distinguish a mounted man from one on foot. Napoleon, in the blue cloak which he had worn on his Italian campaign, sat on his small gray Arab horse a little in front of his marshals. He gazed silently at the hills which seemed to rise out of the sea of mist and on which the Russian troops were moving in the distance, and he listened to the sounds of firing in the valley. Not a single muscle of his face\u2014which in those days was still thin\u2014moved. His gleaming eyes were fixed intently on one spot. His predictions were being justified. Part of the Russian force had already descended into the valley toward the ponds and lakes and part were leaving these Pratzen Heights which he intended to attack and regarded as the key to the position. He saw over the mist that in a hollow between two hills near the village of Pratzen, the Russian columns, their bayonets glittering, were moving continuously in one direction toward the valley and disappearing one after another into the mist. From information he had received the evening before, from the sound of wheels and footsteps heard by the outposts during the night, by the disorderly movement of the Russian columns, and from all indications, he saw clearly that the allies believed him to be far away in front of them, and that the columns moving near Pratzen constituted the center of the Russian army, and that that center was already sufficiently weakened to be successfully attacked. But still he did not begin the engagement.\n\nToday was a great day for him\u2014the anniversary of his coronation. Before dawn he had slept for a few hours, and refreshed, vigorous, and in good spirits, he mounted his horse and rode out into the field in that happy mood in which everything seems possible and everything succeeds. He sat motionless, looking at the heights visible above the mist, and his cold face wore that special look of confident, self-complacent happiness that one sees on the face of a boy happily in love. The marshals stood behind him not venturing to distract his attention. He looked now at the Pratzen Heights, now at the sun floating up out of the mist.\n\nWhen the sun had entirely emerged from the fog, and fields and mist were aglow with dazzling light\u2014as if he had only awaited this to begin the action\u2014he drew the glove from his shapely white hand, made a sign with it to the marshals, and ordered the action to begin. The marshals, accompanied by adjutants, galloped off in different directions, and a few minutes later the chief forces of the French army moved rapidly toward those Pratzen Heights which were being more and more denuded by Russian troops moving down the valley to their left.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt eight o\u2019clock Kut\u00fazov rode to Pratzen at the head of the fourth column, Milor\u00e1dovich\u2019s, the one that was to take the place of Przebysz\u00e9wski\u2019s and Langeron\u2019s columns which had already gone down into the valley. He greeted the men of the foremost regiment and gave them the order to march, thereby indicating that he intended to lead that column himself. When he had reached the village of Pratzen he halted. Prince Andrew was behind, among the immense number forming the commander in chief\u2019s suite. He was in a state of suppressed excitement and irritation, though controlledly calm as a man is at the approach of a long-awaited moment. He was firmly convinced that this was the day of his Toulon, or his bridge of Arcola. How it would come about he did not know, but he felt sure it would do so. The locality and the position of our troops were known to him as far as they could be known to anyone in our army. His own strategic plan, which obviously could not now be carried out, was forgotten. Now, entering into Weyrother\u2019s plan, Prince Andrew considered possible contingencies and formed new projects such as might call for his rapidity of perception and decision.\n\nTo the left down below in the mist, the musketry fire of unseen forces could be heard. It was there Prince Andrew thought the fight would concentrate. \u201cThere we shall encounter difficulties, and there,\u201d thought he, \u201cI shall be sent with a brigade or division, and there, standard in hand, I shall go forward and break whatever is in front of me.\u201d\n\nHe could not look calmly at the standards of the passing battalions. Seeing them he kept thinking, \u201cThat may be the very standard with which I shall lead the army.\u201d\n\nIn the morning all that was left of the night mist on the heights was a hoar frost now turning to dew, but in the valleys it still lay like a milk-white sea. Nothing was visible in the valley to the left into which our troops had descended and from whence cam", "sequence": 6}, {"offset": 700000, "text": "e the sounds of firing. Above the heights was the dark clear sky, and to the right the vast orb of the sun. In front, far off on the farther shore of that sea of mist, some wooded hills were discernible, and it was there the enemy probably was, for something could be descried. On the right the Guards were entering the misty region with a sound of hoofs and wheels and now and then a gleam of bayonets; to the left beyond the village similar masses of cavalry came up and disappeared in the sea of mist. In front and behind moved infantry. The commander in chief was standing at the end of the village letting the troops pass by him. That morning Kut\u00fazov seemed worn and irritable. The infantry passing before him came to a halt without any command being given, apparently obstructed by something in front.\n\n\u201cDo order them to form into battalion columns and go round the village!\u201d he said angrily to a general who had ridden up. \u201cDon\u2019t you understand, your excellency, my dear sir, that you must not defile through narrow village streets when we are marching against the enemy?\u201d\n\n\u201cI intended to re-form them beyond the village, your excellency,\u201d answered the general.\n\nKut\u00fazov laughed bitterly.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll make a fine thing of it, deploying in sight of the enemy! Very fine!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe enemy is still far away, your excellency. According to the dispositions...\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dispositions!\u201d exclaimed Kut\u00fazov bitterly. \u201cWho told you that?... Kindly do as you are ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow,\u201d Nesv\u00edtski whispered to Prince Andrew, \u201cthe old man is as surly as a dog.\u201d\n\nAn Austrian officer in a white uniform with green plumes in his hat galloped up to Kut\u00fazov and asked in the Emperor\u2019s name had the fourth column advanced into action.\n\nKut\u00fazov turned round without answering and his eye happened to fall upon Prince Andrew, who was beside him. Seeing him, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s malevolent and caustic expression softened, as if admitting that what was being done was not his adjutant\u2019s fault, and still not answering the Austrian adjutant, he addressed Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cGo, my dear fellow, and see whether the third division has passed the village. Tell it to stop and await my orders.\u201d\n\nHardly had Prince Andrew started than he stopped him.\n\n\u201cAnd ask whether sharpshooters have been posted,\u201d he added. \u201cWhat are they doing? What are they doing?\u201d he murmured to himself, still not replying to the Austrian.\n\nPrince Andrew galloped off to execute the order.\n\nOvertaking the battalions that continued to advance, he stopped the third division and convinced himself that there really were no sharpshooters in front of our columns. The colonel at the head of the regiment was much surprised at the commander in chief\u2019s order to throw out skirmishers. He had felt perfectly sure that there were other troops in front of him and that the enemy must be at least six miles away. There was really nothing to be seen in front except a barren descent hidden by dense mist. Having given orders in the commander in chief\u2019s name to rectify this omission, Prince Andrew galloped back. Kut\u00fazov still in the same place, his stout body resting heavily in the saddle with the lassitude of age, sat yawning wearily with closed eyes. The troops were no longer moving, but stood with the butts of their muskets on the ground.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d he said to Prince Andrew, and turned to a general who, watch in hand, was saying it was time they started as all the left-flank columns had already descended.\n\n\u201cPlenty of time, your excellency,\u201d muttered Kut\u00fazov in the midst of a yawn. \u201cPlenty of time,\u201d he repeated.\n\nJust then at a distance behind Kut\u00fazov was heard the sound of regiments saluting, and this sound rapidly came nearer along the whole extended line of the advancing Russian columns. Evidently the person they were greeting was riding quickly. When the soldiers of the regiment in front of which Kut\u00fazov was standing began to shout, he rode a little to one side and looked round with a frown. Along the road from Pratzen galloped what looked like a squadron of horsemen in various uniforms. Two of them rode side by side in front, at full gallop. One in a black uniform with white plumes in his hat rode a bobtailed chestnut horse, the other who was in a white uniform rode a black one. These were the two Emperors followed by their suites. Kut\u00fazov, affecting the manners of an old soldier at the front, gave the command \u201cAttention!\u201d and rode up to the Emperors with a salute. His whole appearance and manner were suddenly transformed. He put on the air of a subordinate who obeys without reasoning. With an affectation of respect which evidently struck Alexander unpleasantly, he rode up and saluted.\n\nThis unpleasant impression merely flitted over the young and happy face of the Emperor like a cloud of haze across a clear sky and vanished. After his illness he looked rather thinner that day than on the field of Olm\u00fctz where Bolk\u00f3nski had seen him for the first time abroad, but there was still the same bewitching combination of majesty and mildness in his fine gray eyes, and on his delicate lips the same capacity for varying expression and the same prevalent appearance of goodhearted innocent youth.\n\nAt the Olm\u00fctz review he had seemed more majestic; here he seemed brighter and more energetic. He was slightly flushed after galloping two miles, and reining in his horse he sighed restfully and looked round at the faces of his suite, young and animated as his own. Czartor\u00fdski, Novos\u00edltsev, Prince Volk\u00f3nsky, Str\u00f3gonov, and the others, all richly dressed gay young men on splendid, well-groomed, fresh, only slightly heated horses, exchanging remarks and smiling, had stopped behind the Emperor. The Emperor Francis, a rosy, long faced young man, sat very erect on his handsome black horse, looking about him in a leisurely and preoccupied manner. He beckoned to one of his white adjutants and asked some question\u2014\u201cMost likely he is asking at what o\u2019clock they started,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, watching his old acquaintance with a smile he could not repress as he recalled his reception at Br\u00fcnn. In the Emperors\u2019 suite were the picked young orderly officers of the Guard and line regiments, Russian and Austrian. Among them were grooms leading the Tsar\u2019s beautiful relay horses covered with embroidered cloths.\n\nAs when a window is opened a whiff of fresh air from the fields enters a stuffy room, so a whiff of youthfulness, energy, and confidence of success reached Kut\u00fazov\u2019s cheerless staff with the galloping advent of all these brilliant young men.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you beginning, Michael Ilari\u00f3novich?\u201d said the Emperor Alexander hurriedly to Kut\u00fazov, glancing courteously at the same time at the Emperor Francis.\n\n\u201cI am waiting, Your Majesty,\u201d answered Kut\u00fazov, bending forward respectfully.\n\nThe Emperor, frowning slightly, bent his ear forward as if he had not quite heard.\n\n\u201cWaiting, Your Majesty,\u201d repeated Kut\u00fazov. (Prince Andrew noted that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s upper lip twitched unnaturally as he said the word \u201cwaiting.\u201d) \u201cNot all the columns have formed up yet, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\nThe Tsar heard but obviously did not like the reply; he shrugged his rather round shoulders and glanced at Novos\u00edltsev who was near him, as if complaining of Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cYou know, Michael Ilari\u00f3novich, we are not on the Empress\u2019 Field where a parade does not begin till all the troops are assembled,\u201d said the Tsar with another glance at the Emperor Francis, as if inviting him if not to join in at least to listen to what he was saying. But the Emperor Francis continued to look about him and did not listen.\n\n\u201cThat is just why I do not begin, sire,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov in a resounding voice, apparently to preclude the possibility of not being heard, and again something in his face twitched\u2014\u201cThat is just why I do not begin, sire, because we are not on parade and not on the Empress\u2019 Field,\u201d said he clearly and distinctly.\n\nIn the Emperor\u2019s suite all exchanged rapid looks that expressed dissatisfaction and reproach. \u201cOld though he may be, he should not, he certainly should not, speak like that,\u201d their glances seemed to say.\n\nThe Tsar looked intently and observantly into Kut\u00fazov\u2019s eye waiting to hear whether he would say anything more. But Kut\u00fazov, with respectfully bowed head, seemed also to be waiting. The silence lasted for about a minute.\n\n\u201cHowever, if you command it, Your Majesty,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, lifting his head and again assuming his former tone of a dull, unreasoning, but submissive general.\n\nHe touched his horse and having called Milor\u00e1dovich, the commander of the column, gave him the order to advance.\n\nThe troops again began to move, and two battalions of the N\u00f3vgorod and one of the \u00c1psheron regiment went forward past the Emperor.\n\nAs this \u00c1psheron battalion marched by, the red-faced Milor\u00e1dovich, without his greatcoat, with his Orders on his breast and an enormous tuft of plumes in his cocked hat worn on one side with its corners front and back, galloped strenuously forward, and with a dashing salute reined in his horse before the Emperor.\n\n\u201cGod be with you, general!\u201d said the Emperor.\n\n\u201cMa foi, sire, nous ferons ce qui sera dans notre possibilit\u00e9, sire,\u201d he answered gaily, raising nevertheless ironic smiles among the gentlemen of the Tsar\u2019s suite by his poor French.\n\nMilor\u00e1dovich wheeled his horse sharply and stationed himself a little behind the Emperor. The \u00c1psheron men, excited by the Tsar\u2019s presence, passed in step before the Emperors and their suites at a bold, brisk pace.\n\n\u201cLads!\u201d shouted Milor\u00e1dovich in a loud, self-confident, and cheery voice, obviously so elated by the sound of firing, by the prospect of battle, and by the sight of the gallant \u00c1psherons, his comrades in Suv\u00f3rov\u2019s time, now passing so gallantly before the Emperors, that he forgot the sovereigns\u2019 presence. \u201cLads, it\u2019s not the first village you\u2019ve had to take,\u201d cried he.\n\n\u201cGlad to do our best!\u201d shouted the soldiers.\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s horse started at the sudden cry. This horse that had carried the sovereign at reviews in Russia bore him also here on the field of Austerlitz, enduring the heedless blows of his left foot and pricking its ears at the sound of shots just as it had done on the Empress\u2019 Field, not understanding the significance of the firing, nor of the nearness of the Emperor Francis\u2019 black cob, nor of all that was being said, thought, and felt that day by its rider.\n\nThe Emperor turned with a smile to one of his followers and made a remark to him, pointing to the gallant \u00c1psherons.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nKut\u00fazov accompanied by his adjutants rode at a walking pace behind the carabineers.\n\nWhen he had gone less than half a mile in the rear of the column he stopped at a solitary, deserted house that had probably once been an inn, where two roads parted. Both of them led downhill and troops were marching along both.\n\nThe fog had begun to clear and enemy troops were already dimly visible about a mile and a half off on the opposite heights. Down below, on the left, the firing became more distinct. Kut\u00fazov had stopped and was speaking to an Austrian general. Prince Andrew, who was a little behind looking at them, turned to an adjutant to ask him for a field glass.\n\n\u201cLook, look!\u201d said this adjutant, looking not at the troops in the distance, but down the hill before him. \u201cIt\u2019s the French!\u201d\n\nThe two generals and the adjutant took hold of the field glass, trying to snatch it from one another. The expression on all their faces suddenly changed to one of horror. The French were supposed to be a mile and a half away, but had suddenly and unexpectedly appeared just in front of us.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the enemy?... No!... Yes, see it is!... for certain.... But how is that?\u201d said different voices.\n\nWith the naked eye Prince Andrew saw below them to the right, not more than five hundred paces from where Kut\u00fazov was standing, a dense French column coming up to meet the \u00c1psherons.\n\n\u201cHere it is! The decisive moment has arrived. My turn has come,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, and striking his horse he rode up to Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cThe \u00c1psherons must be stopped, your excellency,\u201d cried he. But at that very instant a cloud of smoke spread all round, firing was heard quite close at hand, and a voice of na\u00efve terror barely two steps from Prince Andrew shouted, \u201cBrothers! All\u2019s lost!\u201d And at this as if at a command, everyone began to run.\n\nConfused and ever-increasing crowds were running back to where five minutes before the troops had passed the Emperors. Not only would it have been difficult to stop that crowd, it was even impossible not to be carried back with it oneself. Bolk\u00f3nski only tried not to lose touch with it, and looked around bewildered and unable to grasp what was happening in front of him. Nesv\u00edtski with an angry face, red and unlike himself, was shouting to Kut\u00fazov that if he did not ride away at once he would certainly be taken prisoner. Kut\u00fazov remained in the same place and without answering drew out a handkerchief. Blood was flowing from his cheek. Prince Andrew forced his way to him.\n\n\u201cYou are wounded?\u201d he asked, hardly able to master the trembling of his lower jaw.\n\n\u201cThe wound is not here, it is there!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, pressing the handkerchief to his wounded cheek and pointing to the fleeing soldiers. \u201cStop them!\u201d he shouted, and at the same moment, probably realizing that it was impossible to stop them, spurred his horse and rode to the right.\n\nA fresh wave of the flying mob caught him and bore him back with it.\n\nThe troops were running in such a dense mass that once surrounded by them it was difficult to get out again. One was shouting, \u201cGet on! Why are you hindering us?\u201d Another in the same place turned round and fired in the air; a third was striking the horse Kut\u00fazov himself rode. Having by a great effort got away to the left from that flood of men, Kut\u00fazov, with his suite diminished by more than half, rode toward a sound of artillery fire near by. Having forced his way out of the crowd of fugitives, Prince Andrew, trying to keep near Kut\u00fazov, saw on the slope of the hill amid the smoke a Russian battery that was still firing and Frenchmen running toward it. Higher up stood some Russian infantry, neither moving forward to protect the battery nor backward with the fleeing crowd. A mounted general separated himself from the infantry and approached Kut\u00fazov. Of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suite only four remained. They were all pale and exchanged looks in silence.\n\n\u201cStop those wretches!\u201d gasped Kut\u00fazov to the regimental commander, pointing to the flying soldiers; but at that instant, as if to punish him for those words, bullets flew hissing across the regiment and across Kut\u00fazov\u2019s suite like a flock of little birds.\n\nThe French had attacked the battery and, seeing Kut\u00fazov, were firing at him. After this volley the regimental commander clutched at his leg; several soldiers fell, and a second lieutenant who was holding the flag let it fall from his hands. It swayed and fell, but caught on the muskets of the nearest soldiers. The soldiers started firing without orders.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh! Oh!\u201d groaned Kut\u00fazov despairingly and looked around.... \u201cBolk\u00f3nski!\u201d he whispered, his voice trembling from a consciousness of the feebleness of age, \u201cBolk\u00f3nski!\u201d he whispered, pointing to the disordered battalion and at the enemy, \u201cwhat\u2019s that?\u201d\n\nBut before he had finished speaking, Prince Andrew, feeling tears of shame and anger choking him, had already leapt from his horse and run to the standard.\n\n\u201cForward, lads!\u201d he shouted in a voice piercing as a child\u2019s.\n\n\u201cHere it is!\u201d thought he, seizing the staff of the standard and hearing with pleasure the whistle of bullets evidently aimed at him. Several soldiers fell.\n\n\u201cHurrah!\u201d shouted Prince Andrew, and, scarcely able to hold up the heavy standard, he ran forward with full confidence that the whole battalion would follow him.\n\nAnd really he only ran a few steps alone. One soldier moved and then another and soon the whole battalion ran forward shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d and overtook him. A sergeant of the battalion ran up and took the flag that was swaying from its weight in Prince Andrew\u2019s hands, but he was immediately killed. Prince Andrew again seized the standard and, dragging it by the staff, ran on with the battalion. In front he saw our artillerymen, some of whom were fighting, while others, having abandoned their guns, were running toward him. He also saw French infantry soldiers who were seizing the artillery horses and turning the guns round. Prince Andrew and the battalion were already within twenty paces of the cannon. He heard the whistle of bullets above him unceasingly and to right and left of him soldiers continually groaned and dropped. But he did not look at them: he looked only at what was going on in front of him\u2014at the battery. He now saw clearly the figure of a red-haired gunner with his shako knocked awry, pulling one end of a mop while a French soldier tugged at the other. He could distinctly see the distraught yet angry expression on the faces of these two men, who evidently did not realize what they were doing.\n\n\u201cWhat are they about?\u201d thought Prince Andrew as he gazed at them. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t the red-haired gunner run away as he is unarmed? Why doesn\u2019t the Frenchman stab him? He will not get away before the Frenchman remembers his bayonet and stabs him....\u201d\n\nAnd really another French soldier, trailing his musket, ran up to the struggling men, and the fate of the red-haired gunner, who had triumphantly secured the mop and still did not realize what awaited him, was about to be decided. But Prince Andrew did not see how it ended. It seemed to him as though one of the soldiers near him hit him on the head with the full swing of a bludgeon. It hurt a little, but the worst of it was that the pain distracted him and prevented his seeing what he had been looking at.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this? Am I falling? My legs are giving way,\u201d thought he, and fell on his back. He opened his eyes, hoping to see how the struggle of the Frenchmen with the gunners ended, whether the red-haired gunner had been killed or not and whether the cannon had been captured or saved. But he saw nothing. Above him there was now nothing but the sky\u2014the lofty sky, not clear yet still immeasurably lofty, with gray clouds gliding slowly across it. \u201cHow quiet, peaceful, and solemn; not at all as I ran,\u201d thought Prince Andrew\u2014\u201cnot as we ran, shouting and fighting, not at all as the gunner and the Frenchman with frightened and angry faces struggled for the mop: how differently do those clouds glide across that lofty infinite sky! How was it I did not see that lofty sky before? And how happy I am to have found it at last! Yes! All is vanity, all falsehood, except that infinite sky. There is nothing, nothing, but that. But even it does not exist, there is nothing but quiet and peace. Thank God!...\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nOn our right flank commanded by Bagrati\u00f3n, at nine o\u2019clock the battle had not yet begun. Not wishing to agree to Dolgor\u00fakov\u2019s demand to commence the action, and wishing to avert responsibility from himself, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n proposed to Dolgor\u00fakov to send to inquire of the commander in chief. Bagrati\u00f3n knew that as the distance between the two flanks was more than six miles, even if the messenger were not killed (which he very likely would be), and found the commander in chief (which would be very difficult), he would not be able to get back before evening.\n\nBagrati\u00f3n cast his large, expressionless, sleepy eyes round his suite, and the boyish face of Rost\u00f3v, breathless with excitement and hope, was the first to catch his eye. He sent him.\n\n\u201cAnd if I should meet His Majesty before I meet the commander in chief, your excellency?\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, with his hand to his cap.\n\n\u201cYou can give the message to His Majesty,\u201d said Dolgor\u00fakov, hurriedly interrupting Bagrati\u00f3n.\n\nOn being relieved from picket duty Rost\u00f3v had managed to get a few hours\u2019 sleep before morning and felt cheerful, bold, and resolute, with elasticity of movement, faith in his good fortune, and generally in that state of mind which makes everything seem possible, pleasant, and easy.\n\nAll his wishes were being fulfilled that morning: there was to be a general engagement in which he was taking part, more than that, he was orderly to the bravest general, and still more, he was going with a message to Kut\u00fazov, perhaps even to the sovereign himself. The morning was bright, he had a good horse under him, and his heart was full of joy and happiness. On receiving the order he gave his horse the rein and galloped along the line. At first he rode along the line of Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s troops, which had not yet advanced into action but were standing motionless; then he came to the region occupied by Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s cavalry and here he noticed a stir and signs of preparation for battle; having passed Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s cavalry he clearly heard the sound of cannon and musketry ahead of him. The firing grew louder and louder.\n\nIn the fresh morning air were now heard, not two or three musket shots at irregular intervals as before, followed by one or two cannon shots, but a roll of volleys of musketry from the slopes of the hill before Pratzen, interrupted by such frequent reports of cannon that sometimes several of them were not separated from one another but merged into a general roar.\n\nHe could see puffs of musketry smoke that seemed to chase one another down the hillsides, and clouds of cannon smoke rolling, spreading, and mingling with one another. He could also, by the gleam of bayonets visible through the smoke, make out moving masses of infantry and narrow lines of artillery with green caissons.\n\nRost\u00f3v stopped his horse for a moment on a hillock to see what was going on, but strain his attention as he would he could not understand or make out anything of what was happening: there in the smoke men of some sort were moving about, in front and behind moved lines of troops; but why, whither, and who they were, it was impossible to make out. These sights and sounds had no depressing or intimidating effect on him; on the contrary, they stimulated his energy and determination.\n\n\u201cGo on! Go on! Give it them!\u201d he mentally exclaimed at these sounds, and again proceeded to gallop along the line, penetrating farther and farther into the region where the army was already in action.\n\n\u201cHow it will be there I don\u2019t know, but all will be well!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\nAfter passing some Austrian troops he noticed that the next part of the line (the Guards) was already in action.\n\n\u201cSo much the better! I shall see it close,\u201d he thought.\n\nHe was riding almost along the front line. A handful of men came galloping toward him. They were our Uhlans who with disordered ranks were returning from the attack. Rost\u00f3v got out of their way, involuntarily noticed that one of them was bleeding, and galloped on.\n\n\u201cThat is no business of mine,\u201d he thought. He had not ridden many hundred yards after that before he saw to his left, across the whole width of the field, an enormous mass of cavalry in brilliant white uniforms, mounted on black horses, trotting straight toward him and across his path. Rost\u00f3v put his horse to full gallop to get out of the way of these men, and he would have got clear had they continued at the same speed, but they kept increasing their pace, so that some of the horses were already galloping. Rost\u00f3v heard the thud of their hoofs and the jingle of their weapons and saw their horses, their figures, and even their faces, more and more distinctly. They were our Horse Guards, advancing to attack the French cavalry that was coming to meet them.\n\nThe Horse Guards were galloping, but still holding in their horses. Rost\u00f3v could already see their faces and heard the command: \u201cCharge!\u201d shouted by an officer who was urging his thoroughbred to full speed. Rost\u00f3v, fearing to be crushed or swept into the attack on the French, galloped along the front as hard as his horse could go, but still was not in time to avoid them.\n\nThe last of the Horse Guards, a huge pockmarked fellow, frowned angrily on seeing Rost\u00f3v before him, with whom he would inevitably collide. This Guardsman would certainly have bowled Rost\u00f3v and his Bedouin over (Rost\u00f3v felt himself quite tiny and weak compared to these gigantic men and horses) had it not occurred to Rost\u00f3v to flourish his whip before the eyes of the Guardsman\u2019s horse. The heavy black horse, sixteen hands high, shied, throwing back its ears; but the pockmarked Guardsman drove his huge spurs in violently, and the horse, flourishing its tail and extending its neck, galloped on yet faster. Hardly had the Horse Guards passed Rost\u00f3v before he heard them shout, \u201cHurrah!\u201d and looking back saw that their foremost ranks were mixed up with some foreign cavalry with red epaulets, probably French. He could see nothing more, for immediately afterwards cannon began firing from somewhere and smoke enveloped everything.\n\nAt that moment, as the Horse Guards, having passed him, disappeared in the smoke, Rost\u00f3v hesitated whether to gallop after them or to go where he was sent. This was the brilliant charge of the Horse Guards that amazed the French themselves. Rost\u00f3v was horrified to hear later that of all that mass of huge and handsome men, of all those brilliant, rich youths, officers and cadets, who had galloped past him on their thousand-ruble horses, only eighteen were left after the charge.\n\n\u201cWhy should I envy them? My chance is not lost, and maybe I shall see the Emperor immediately!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v and galloped on.\n\nWhen he came level with the Foot Guards he noticed that about them and around them cannon balls were flying, of which he was aware not so much because he heard their sound as because he saw uneasiness on the soldiers\u2019 faces and unnatural warlike solemnity on those of the officers.\n\nPassing behind one of the lines of a regiment of Foot Guards he heard a voice calling him by name.\n\n\u201cRost\u00f3v!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d he answered, not recognizing Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cI say, we\u2019ve been in the front line! Our regiment attacked!\u201d said Bor\u00eds with the happy smile seen on the faces of young men who have been under fire for the first time.\n\nRost\u00f3v stopped.\n\n\u201cHave you?\u201d he said. \u201cWell, how did it go?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe drove them back!\u201d said Bor\u00eds with animation, growing talkative. \u201cCan you imagine it?\u201d and he began describing how the Guards, having taken up their position and seeing troops before them, thought they were Austrians, and all at once discovered from the cannon balls discharged by those troops that they were themselves in the front line and had unexpectedly to go into action. Rost\u00f3v without hearing Bor\u00eds to the end spurred his horse.\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to?\u201d asked Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cWith a message to His Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere he is!\u201d said Bor\u00eds, thinking Rost\u00f3v had said \u201cHis Highness,\u201d and pointing to the Grand Duke who with his high shoulders and frowning brows stood a hundred paces away from them in his helmet and Horse Guards\u2019 jacket, shouting something to a pale, white uniformed Austrian officer.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s the Grand Duke, and I want the commander in chief or the Emperor,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, and was about to spur his horse.\n\n\u201cCount! Count!\u201d shouted Berg who ran up from the other side as eager as Bor\u00eds. \u201cCount! I am wounded in my right hand\u201d (and he showed his bleeding hand with a handkerchief tied round it) \u201cand I remained at the front. I held my sword in my left hand, Count. All our family\u2014the von Bergs\u2014have been knights!\u201d\n\nHe said something more, but Rost\u00f3v did not wait to hear it and rode away.\n\nHaving passed the Guards and traversed an empty space, Rost\u00f3v, to avoid again getting in front of the first line as he had done when the Horse Guards charged, followed the line of reserves, going far round the place where the hottest musket fire and cannonade were heard. Suddenly he heard musket fire quite close in front of him and behind our troops, where he could never have expected the enemy to be.\n\n\u201cWhat can it be?\u201d he thought. \u201cThe enemy in the rear of our army? Impossible!\u201d And suddenly he was seized by a panic of fear for himself and for the issue of the whole battle. \u201cBut be that what it may,\u201d he reflected, \u201cthere is no riding round it now. I must look for the commander in chief here, and if all is lost it is for me to perish with the rest.\u201d\n\nThe foreboding of evil that had suddenly come over Rost\u00f3v was more and more confirmed the farther he rode into the region behind the village of Pratzen, which was full of troops of all kinds.\n\n\u201cWhat does it mean? What is it? Whom are they firing at? Who is firing?\u201d Rost\u00f3v kept asking as he came up to Russian and Austrian soldiers running in confused crowds across his path.\n\n\u201cThe devil knows! They\u2019ve killed everybody! It\u2019s all up now!\u201d he was told in Russian, German, and Czech by the crowd of fugitives who understood what was happening as little as he did.\n\n\u201cKill the Germans!\u201d shouted one.\n\n\u201cMay the devil take them\u2014the traitors!\u201d\n\n\u201cZum Henker diese Russen!\u201d muttered a German.\n\nSeveral wounded men passed along the road, and words of abuse, screams, and groans mingled in a general hubbub, then the firing died down. Rost\u00f3v learned later that Russian and Austrian soldiers had been firing at one another.\n\n\u201cMy God! What does it all mean?\u201d thought he. \u201cAnd here, where at any moment the Emperor may see them.... But no, these must be only a handful of scoundrels. It will soon be over, it can\u2019t be that, it can\u2019t be! Only to get past them quicker, quicker!\u201d\n\nThe idea of defeat and flight could not enter Rost\u00f3v\u2019s head. Though he saw French cannon and French troops on the Pratzen Heights just where he had been ordered to look for the commander in chief, he could not, did not wish to, believe that.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nRost\u00f3v had been ordered to look for Kut\u00fazov and the Emperor near the village of Pratzen. But neither they nor a single commanding officer were there, only disorganized crowds of troops of various kinds. He urged on his already weary horse to get quickly past these crowds, but the farther he went the more disorganized they were. The highroad on which he had come out was thronged with cal\u00e8ches, carriages of all sorts, and Russian and Austrian soldiers of all arms, some wounded and some not. This whole mass droned and jostled in confusion under the dismal influence of cannon balls flying from the French batteries stationed on the Pratzen Heights.\n\n\u201cWhere is the Emperor? Where is Kut\u00fazov?\u201d Rost\u00f3v kept asking everyone he could stop, but got no answer from anyone.\n\nAt last seizing a soldier by his collar he forced him to answer.\n\n\u201cEh, brother! They\u2019ve all bolted long ago!\u201d said the soldier, laughing for some reason and shaking himself free.\n\nHaving left that soldier who was evidently drunk, Rost\u00f3v stopped the horse of a batman or groom of some important personage and began to question him. The man announced that the Tsar had been driven in a carriage at full speed about an hour before along that very road and that he was dangerously wounded.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt must have been someone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI saw him myself,\u201d replied the man with a self-confident smile of derision. \u201cI ought to know the Emperor by now, after the times I\u2019ve seen him in Petersburg. I saw him just as I see you.... There he sat in the carriage as pale as anything. How they made the four black horses fly! Gracious me, they did rattle past! It\u2019s time I knew the Imperial horses and Ily\u00e1 Iv\u00e1nych. I don\u2019t think Ily\u00e1 drives anyone except the Tsar!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v let go of the horse and was about to ride on, when a wounded officer passing by addressed him:\n\n\u201cWho is it you want?\u201d he asked. \u201cThe commander in chief? He was killed by a cannon ball\u2014struck in the breast before our regiment.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot killed\u2014wounded!\u201d another officer corrected him.\n\n\u201cWho? Kut\u00fazov?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cNot Kut\u00fazov, but what\u2019s his name\u2014well, never mind... there are not many left alive. Go that way, to that village, all the commanders are there,\u201d said the officer, pointing to the village of Hosjeradek, and he walked on.\n\nRost\u00f3v rode on at a footpace not knowing why or to whom he was now going. The Emperor was wounded, the battle lost. It was impossible to doubt it now. Rost\u00f3v rode in the direction pointed out to him, in which he saw turrets and a church. What need to hurry? What was he now to say to the Tsar or to Kut\u00fazov, even if they were alive and unwounded?\n\n\u201cTake this road, your honor, that way you will be killed at once!\u201d a soldier shouted to him. \u201cThey\u2019d kill you there!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, what are you talking about?\u201d said another. \u201cWhere is he to go? That way is nearer.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v considered, and then went in the direction where they said he would be killed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same now. If the Emperor is wounded, am I to try to save myself?\u201d he thought. He rode on to the region where the greatest number of men had perished in fleeing from Pratzen. The French had not yet occupied that region, and the Russians\u2014the uninjured and slightly wounded\u2014had left it long ago. All about the field, like heaps of manure on well-kept plowland, lay from ten to fifteen dead and wounded to each couple of acres. The wounded crept together in twos and threes and one could hear their distressing screams and groans, sometimes feigned\u2014or so it seemed to Rost\u00f3v. He put his horse to a trot to avoid seeing all these suffering men, and he felt afraid\u2014afraid not for his life, but for the courage he needed and which he knew would not stand the sight of these unfortunates.\n\nThe French, who had ceased firing at this field strewn with dead and wounded where there was no one left to fire at, on seeing an adjutant riding over it trained a gun on him and fired several shots. The sensation of those terrible whistling sounds and of the corpses around him merged in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s mind into a single feeling of terror and pity for himself. He remembered his mother\u2019s last letter. \u201cWhat would she feel,\u201d thought he, \u201cif she saw me here now on this field with the cannon aimed at me?\u201d\n\nIn the village of Hosjeradek there were Russian troops retiring from the field of battle, who though still in some confusion were less disordered. The French cannon did not reach there and the musketry fire sounded far away. Here everyone clearly saw and said that the battle was lost. No one whom Rost\u00f3v asked could tell him where the Emperor or Kut\u00fazov was. Some said the report that the Emperor was wounded was correct, others that it was not, and explained the false rumor that had spread by the fact that the Emperor\u2019s carriage had really galloped from the field of battle with the pale and terrified Ober-Hofmarschal Count Tolst\u00f3y, who had ridden out to the battlefield with others in the Emperor\u2019s suite. One officer told Rost\u00f3v that he had seen someone from headquarters behind the village to the left, and thither Rost\u00f3v rode, not hoping to find anyone but merely to ease his conscience. When he had ridden about two miles and had passed the last of the Russian troops, he saw, near a kitchen garden with a ditch round it, two men on horseback facing the ditch. One with a white plume in his hat seemed familiar to Rost\u00f3v; the other on a beautiful chestnut horse (which Rost\u00f3v fancied he had seen before) rode up to the ditch, struck his horse with his spurs, and giving it the rein leaped lightly over. Only a little earth crumbled from the bank under the horse\u2019s hind hoofs. Turning the horse sharply, he again jumped the ditch, and deferentially addressed the horseman with the white plumes, evidently suggesting that he should do the same. The rider, whose figure seemed familiar to Rost\u00f3v and involuntarily riveted his attention, made a gesture of refusal with his head and hand and by that gesture Rost\u00f3v instantly recognized his lamented and adored monarch.\n\n\u201cBut it can\u2019t be he, alone in the midst of this empty field!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. At that moment Alexander turned his head and Rost\u00f3v saw the beloved features that were so deeply engraved on his memory. The Emperor was pale, his cheeks sunken and his eyes hollow, but the charm, the mildness of his features, was all the greater. Rost\u00f3v was happy in the assurance that the rumors about the Emperor being wounded were false. He was happy to be seeing him. He knew that he might and even ought to go straight to him and give the message Dolgor\u00fakov had ordered him to deliver.\n\nBut as a youth in love trembles, is unnerved, and dares not utter the thoughts he has dreamed of for nights, but looks around for help or a chance of delay and flight when the longed-for moment comes and he is alone with her, so Rost\u00f3v, now that he had attained what he had longed for more than anything else in the world, did not know how to approach the Emperor, and a thousand reasons occurred to him why it would be inconvenient, unseemly, and impossible to do so.\n\n\u201cWhat! It is as if I were glad of a chance to take advantage of his being alone and despondent! A strange face may seem unpleasant or painful to him at this moment of sorrow; besides, what can I say to him now, when my heart fails me and my mouth feels dry at the mere sight of him?\u201d Not one of the innumerable speeches addressed to the Emperor that he had composed in his imagination could he now recall. Those speeches were intended for quite other conditions, they were for the most part to be spoken at a moment of victory and triumph, generally when he was dying of wounds and the sovereign had thanked him for heroic deeds, and while dying he expressed the love his actions had proved.\n\n\u201cBesides how can I ask the Emperor for his instructions for the right flank now that it is nearly four o\u2019clock and the battle is lost? No, certainly I must not approach him, I must not intrude on his reflections. Better die a thousand times than risk receiving an unkind look or bad opinion from him,\u201d Rost\u00f3v decided; and sorrowfully and with a heart full despair he rode away, continually looking back at the Tsar, who still remained in the same attitude of indecision.\n\nWhile Rost\u00f3v was thus arguing with himself and riding sadly away, Captain von Toll chanced to ride to the same spot, and seeing the Emperor at once rode up to him, offered his services, and assisted him to cross the ditch on foot. The Emperor, wishing to rest and feeling unwell, sat down under an apple tree and von Toll remained beside him. Rost\u00f3v from a distance saw with envy and remorse how von Toll spoke long and warmly to the Emperor and how the Emperor, evidently weeping, covered his eyes with his hand and pressed von Toll\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cAnd I might have been in his place!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, and hardly restraining his tears of pity for the Emperor, he rode on in utter despair, not knowing where to or why he was now riding.\n\nHis despair was all the greater from feeling that his own weakness was the cause of his grief.\n\nHe might... not only might but should, have gone up to the sovereign. It was a unique chance to show his devotion to the Emperor and he had not made use of it.... \u201cWhat have I done?\u201d thought he. And he turned round and galloped back to the place where he had seen the Emperor, but there was no one beyond the ditch now. Only some carts and carriages were passing by. From one of the drivers he learned that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff were not far off, in the village the vehicles were going to. Rost\u00f3v followed them. In front of him walked Kut\u00fazov\u2019s groom leading horses in horsecloths. Then came a cart, and behind that walked an old, bandy-legged domestic serf in a peaked cap and sheepskin coat.\n\n\u201cTit! I say, Tit!\u201d said the groom.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d answered the old man absent-mindedly.\n\n\u201cGo, Tit! Thresh a bit!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you fool!\u201d said the old man, spitting angrily. Some time passed in silence, and then the same joke was repeated.\n\n\nBefore five in the evening the battle had been lost at all points. More than a hundred cannon were already in the hands of the French.\n\nPrzebysz\u00e9wski and his corps had laid down their arms. Other columns after losing half their men were retreating in disorderly confused masses.\n\nThe remains of Langeron\u2019s and Dokht\u00farov\u2019s mingled forces were crowding around the dams and banks of the ponds near the village of Augesd.\n\nAfter five o\u2019clock it was only at the Augesd Dam that a hot cannonade (delivered by the French alone) was still to be heard from numerous batteries ranged on the slopes of the Pratzen Heights, directed at our retreating forces.\n\nIn the rearguard, Dokht\u00farov and others rallying some battalions kept up a musketry fire at the French cavalry that was pursuing our troops. It was growing dusk. On the narrow Augesd Dam where for so many years the old miller had been accustomed to sit in his tasseled cap peacefully angling, while his grandson, with shirt sleeves rolled up, handled the floundering silvery fish in the watering can, on that dam over which for so many years Moravians in shaggy caps and blue jackets had peacefully driven their two-horse carts loaded with wheat and had returned dusty with flour whitening their carts\u2014on that narrow dam amid the wagons and the cannon, under the horses\u2019 hoofs and between the wagon wheels, men disfigured by fear of death now crowded together, crushing one another, dying, stepping over the dying and killing one another, only to move on a few steps and be killed themselves in the same way.\n\nEvery ten seconds a cannon ball flew compressing the air around, or a shell burst in the midst of that dense throng, killing some and splashing with blood those near them.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov\u2014now an officer\u2014wounded in the arm, and on foot, with the regimental commander on horseback and some ten men of his company, represented all that was left of that whole regiment. Impelled by the crowd, they had got wedged in at the approach to the dam and, jammed in on all sides, had stopped because a horse in front had fallen under a cannon and the crowd were dragging it out. A cannon ball killed someone behind them, another fell in front and splashed D\u00f3lokhov with blood. The crowd, pushing forward desperately, squeezed together, moved a few steps, and again stopped.\n\n\u201cMove on a hundred yards and we are certainly saved, remain here another two minutes and it is certain death,\u201d thought each one.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov who was in the midst of the crowd forced his way to the edge of the dam, throwing two soldiers off their feet, and ran onto the slippery ice that covered the millpool.\n\n\u201cTurn this way!\u201d he shouted, jumping over the ice which creaked under him; \u201cturn this way!\u201d he shouted to those with the gun. \u201cIt bears!...\u201d\n\nThe ice bore him but it swayed and creaked, and it was plain that it would give way not only under a cannon or a crowd, but very soon even under his weight alone. The men looked at him and pressed to the bank, hesitating to step onto the ice. The general on horseback at the entrance to the dam raised his hand and opened his mouth to address D\u00f3lokhov. Suddenly a cannon ball hissed so low above the crowd that everyone ducked. It flopped into something moist, and the general fell from his horse in a pool of blood. Nobody gave him a look or thought of raising him.\n\n\u201cGet onto the ice, over the ice! Go on! Turn! Don\u2019t you hear? Go on!\u201d innumerable voices suddenly shouted after the ball had struck the general, the men themselves not knowing what, or why, they were shouting.\n\nOne of the hindmost guns that was going onto the dam turned off onto the ice. Crowds of soldiers from the dam began running onto the frozen pond. The ice gave way under one of the foremost soldiers, and one leg slipped into the water. He tried to right himself but fell in up to his waist. The nearest soldiers shrank back, the gun driver stopped his horse, but from behind still came the shouts: \u201cOnto the ice, why do you stop? Go on! Go on!\u201d And cries of horror were heard in the crowd. The soldiers near the gun waved their arms and beat the horses to make them turn and move on. The horses moved off the bank. The ice, that had held under those on foot, collapsed in a great mass, and some forty men who were on it dashed, some forward and some back, drowning one another.\n\nStill the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam, the pond, and the bank.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOn the Pratzen Heights, where he had fallen with the flagstaff in his hand, lay Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski bleeding profusely and unconsciously uttering a gentle, piteous, and childlike moan.\n\nToward evening he ceased moaning and became quite still. He did not know how long his unconsciousness lasted. Suddenly he again felt that he was alive and suffering from a burning, lacerating pain in his head.\n\n\u201cWhere is it, that lofty sky that I did not know till now, but saw today?\u201d was his first thought. \u201cAnd I did not know this suffering either,\u201d he thought. \u201cYes, I did not know anything, anything at all till now. But where am I?\u201d\n\nHe listened and heard the sound of approaching horses, and voices speaking French. He opened his eyes. Above him again was the same lofty sky with clouds that had risen and were floating still higher, and between them gleamed blue infinity. He did not turn his head and did not see those who, judging by the sound of hoofs and voices, had ridden up and stopped near him.\n\nIt was Napoleon accompanied by two aides-de-camp. Bonaparte riding over the battlefield had given final orders to strengthen the batteries firing at the Augesd Dam and was looking at the killed and wounded left on the field.\n\n\u201cFine men!\u201d remarked Napoleon, looking at a dead Russian grenadier, who, with his face buried in the ground and a blackened nape, lay on his stomach with an already stiffened arm flung wide.\n\n\u201cThe ammunition for the guns in position is exhausted, Your Majesty,\u201d said an adjutant who had come from the batteries that were firing at Augesd.\n\n\u201cHave some brought from the reserve,\u201d said Napoleon, and having gone on a few steps he stopped before Prince Andrew, who lay on his back with the flagstaff that had been dropped beside him. (The flag had already been taken by the French as a trophy.)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a fine death!\u201d said Napoleon as he gazed at Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\nPrince Andrew understood that this was said of him and that it was Napoleon who said it. He heard the speaker addressed as Sire. But he heard the words as he might have heard the buzzing of a fly. Not only did they not interest him, but he took no notice of them and at once forgot them. His head was burning, he felt himself bleeding to death, and he saw above him the remote, lofty, and everlasting sky. He knew it was Napoleon\u2014his hero\u2014but at that moment Napoleon seemed to him such a small, insignificant creature compared with what was passing now between himself and that lofty infinite sky with the clouds flying over it. At that moment it meant nothing to him who might be standing over him, or what was said of him; he was only glad that people were standing near him and only wished that they would help him and bring him back to life, which seemed to him so beautiful now that he had today learned to understand it so differently. He collected all his strength, to stir and utter a sound. He feebly moved his leg and uttered a weak, sickly groan which aroused his own pity.\n\n\u201cAh! He is alive,\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cLift this young man up and carry him to the dressing station.\u201d\n\nHaving said this, Napoleon rode on to meet Marshal Lannes, who, hat in hand, rode up smiling to the Emperor to congratulate him on the victory.\n\nPrince Andrew remembered nothing more: he lost consciousness from the terrible pain of being lifted onto the stretcher, the jolting while being moved, and the probing of his wound at the dressing station. He did not regain consciousness till late in the day, when with other wounded and captured Russian officers he was carried to the hospital. During this transfer he felt a little stronger and was able to look about him and even speak.\n\nThe first words he heard on coming to his senses were those of a French convoy officer, who said rapidly: \u201cWe must halt here: the Emperor will pass here immediately; it will please him to see these gentlemen prisoners.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are so many prisoners today, nearly the whole Russian army, that he is probably tired of them,\u201d said another officer.\n\n\u201cAll the same! They say this one is the commander of all the Emperor Alexander\u2019s Guards,\u201d said the first one, indicating a Russian officer in the white uniform of the Horse Guards.\n\nBolk\u00f3nski recognized Prince Repn\u00edn whom he had met in Petersburg society. Beside him stood a lad of nineteen, also a wounded officer of the Horse Guards.\n\nBonaparte, having come up at a gallop, stopped his horse.\n\n\u201cWhich is the senior?\u201d he asked, on seeing the prisoners.\n\nThey named the colonel, Prince Repn\u00edn.\n\n\u201cYou are the commander of the Emperor Alexander\u2019s regiment of Horse Guards?\u201d asked Napoleon.\n\n\u201cI commanded a squadron,\u201d replied Repn\u00edn.\n\n\u201cYour regiment fulfilled its duty honorably,\u201d said Napoleon.\n\n\u201cThe praise of a great commander is a soldier\u2019s highest reward,\u201d said Repn\u00edn.\n\n\u201cI bestow it with pleasure,\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cAnd who is that young man beside you?\u201d\n\nPrince Repn\u00edn named Lieutenant Sukht\u00e9len.\n\nAfter looking at him Napoleon smiled.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very young to come to meddle with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cYouth is no hindrance to courage,\u201d muttered Sukht\u00e9len in a failing voice.\n\n\u201cA splendid reply!\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cYoung man, you will go far!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had also been brought forward before the Emperor\u2019s eyes to complete the show of prisoners, could not fail to attract his attention. Napoleon apparently remembered seeing him on the battlefield and, addressing him, again used the epithet \u201cyoung man\u201d that was connected in his memory with Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWell, and you, young man,\u201d said he. \u201cHow do you feel, mon brave?\u201d\n\nThough five minutes before, Prince Andrew had been able to say a few words to the soldiers who were carrying him, now with his eyes fixed straight on Napoleon, he was silent.... So insignificant at that moment seemed to him all the interests that engrossed Napoleon, so mean did his hero himself with his paltry vanity and joy in victory appear, compared to the lofty, equitable, and kindly sky which he had seen and understood, that he could not answer him.\n\nEverything seemed so futile and insignificant in comparison with the stern and solemn train of thought that weakness from loss of blood, suffering, and the nearness of death aroused in him. Looking into Napoleon\u2019s eyes Prince Andrew thought of the insignificance of greatness, the unimportance of life which no one could understand, and the still greater unimportance of death, the meaning of which no one alive could understand or explain.\n\nThe Emperor without waiting for an answer turned away and said to one of the officers as he went: \u201cHave these gentlemen attended to and taken to my bivouac; let my doctor, Larrey, examine their wounds. Au revoir, Prince Repn\u00edn!\u201d and he spurred his horse and galloped away.\n\nHis face shone with self-satisfaction and pleasure.\n\nThe soldiers who had carried Prince Andrew had noticed and taken the little gold icon Princess Mary had hung round her brother\u2019s neck, but seeing the favor the Emperor showed the prisoners, they now hastened to return the holy image.\n\nPrince Andrew did not see how and by whom it was replaced, but the little icon with its thin gold chain suddenly appeared upon his chest outside his uniform.\n\n\u201cIt would be good,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, glancing at the icon his sister had hung round his neck with such emotion and reverence, \u201cit would be good if everything were as clear and simple as it seems to Mary. How good it would be to know where to seek for help in this life, and what to expect after it beyond the grave! How happy and calm I should be if I could now say: \u2018Lord, have mercy on me!\u2019... But to whom should I say that? Either to a Power indefinable, incomprehensible, which I not only cannot address but which I cannot even express in words\u2014the Great All or Nothing-\u201d said he to himself, \u201cor to that God who has been sewn into this amulet by Mary! There is nothing certain, nothing at all except the unimportance of everything I understand, and the greatness of something incomprehensible but all-important.\u201d\n\nThe stretchers moved on. At every jolt he again felt unendurable pain; his feverishness increased and he grew delirious. Visions of his father, wife, sister, and future son, and the tenderness he had felt the night before the battle, the figure of the insignificant little Napoleon, and above all this the lofty sky, formed the chief subjects of his delirious fancies.\n\nThe quiet home life and peaceful happiness of Bald Hills presented itself to him. He was already enjoying that happiness when that little Napoleon had suddenly appeared with his unsympathizing look of shortsighted delight at the misery of others, and doubts and torments had followed, and only the heavens promised peace. Toward morning all these dreams melted and merged into the chaos and darkness of unconciousness and oblivion which in the opinion of Napoleon\u2019s doctor, Larrey, was much more likely to end in death than in convalescence.\n\n\u201cHe is a nervous, bilious subject,\u201d said Larrey, \u201cand will not recover.\u201d\n\nAnd Prince Andrew, with others fatally wounded, was left to the care of the inhabitants of the district.\n\n\n\nBOOK FOUR: 1806\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nEarly in the year 1806 Nicholas Rost\u00f3v returned home on leave. Den\u00edsov was going home to Vor\u00f3nezh and Rost\u00f3v persuaded him to travel with him as far as Moscow and to stay with him there. Meeting a comrade at the last post station but one before Moscow, Den\u00edsov had drunk three bottles of wine with him and, despite the jolting ruts across the snow-covered road, did not once wake up on the way to Moscow, but lay at the bottom of the sleigh beside Rost\u00f3v, who grew more and more impatient the nearer they got to Moscow.\n\n\u201cHow much longer? How much longer? Oh, these insufferable streets, shops, bakers\u2019 signboards, street lamps, and sleighs!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, when their leave permits had been passed at the town gate and they had entered Moscow.\n\n\u201cDen\u00edsov! We\u2019re here! He\u2019s asleep,\u201d he added, leaning forward with his whole body as if in that position he hoped to hasten the speed of the sleigh.\n\nDen\u00edsov gave no answer.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s the corner at the crossroads, where the cabman, Zakh\u00e1r, has his stand, and there\u2019s Zakh\u00e1r himself and still the same horse! And here\u2019s the little shop where we used to buy gingerbread! Can\u2019t you hurry up? Now then!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich house is it?\u201d asked the driver.\n\n\u201cWhy, that one, right at the end, the big one. Don\u2019t you see? That\u2019s our house,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cOf course, it\u2019s our house! Den\u00edsov, Den\u00edsov! We\u2019re almost there!\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov raised his head, coughed, and made no answer.\n\n\u201cDm\u00edtri,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v to his valet on the box, \u201cthose lights are in our house, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir, and there\u2019s a light in your father\u2019s study.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen they\u2019ve not gone to bed yet? What do you think? Mind now, don\u2019t forget to put out my new coat,\u201d added Rost\u00f3v, fingering his new mustache. \u201cNow then, get on,\u201d he shouted to the driver. \u201cDo wake up, V\u00e1ska!\u201d he went on, turning to Den\u00edsov, whose head was again nodding. \u201cCome, get on! You shall have three rubles for vodka\u2014get on!\u201d Rost\u00f3v shouted, when the sleigh was only three houses from his door. It seemed to him the horses were not moving at all. At last the sleigh bore to the right, drew up at an entrance, and Rost\u00f3v saw overhead the old familiar cornice with a bit of plaster broken off, the porch, and the post by the side of the pavement. He sprang out before the sleigh stopped, and ran into the hall. The house stood cold and silent, as if quite regardless of who had come to it. There was no one in the hall. \u201cOh God! Is everyone all right?\u201d he thought, stopping for a moment with a sinking heart, and then immediately starting to run along the hall and up the warped steps of the familiar staircase. The well-known old door handle, which always angered the countess when it was not properly cleaned, turned as loosely as ever. A solitary tallow candle burned in the anteroom.\n\nOld Michael was asleep on the chest. Prok\u00f3fy, the footman, who was so strong that he could lift the back of the carriage from behind, sat plaiting slippers out of cloth selvedges. He looked up at the opening door and his expression of sleepy indifference suddenly changed to one of delighted amazement.\n\n\u201cGracious heavens! The young count!\u201d he cried, recognizing his young master. \u201cCan it be? My treasure!\u201d and Prok\u00f3fy, trembling with excitement, rushed toward the drawing room door, probably in order to announce him, but, changing his mind, came back and stooped to kiss the young man\u2019s shoulder.\n\n\u201cAll well?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v, drawing away his arm.\n\n\u201cYes, God be thanked! Yes! They\u2019ve just finished supper. Let me have a look at you, your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs everything quite all right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Lord be thanked, yes!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, who had completely forgotten Den\u00edsov, not wishing anyone to forestall him, threw off his fur coat and ran on tiptoe through the large dark ballroom. All was the same: there were the same old card tables and the same chandelier with a cover over it; but someone had already seen the young master, and, before he had reached the drawing room, something flew out from a side door like a tornado and began hugging and kissing him. Another and yet another creature of the same kind sprang from a second door and a third; more hugging, more kissing, more outcries, and tears of joy. He could not distinguish which was Papa, which Nat\u00e1sha, and which P\u00e9tya. Everyone shouted, talked, and kissed him at the same time. Only his mother was not there, he noticed that.\n\n\u201cAnd I did not know... Nicholas... My darling!...\u201d\n\n\u201cHere he is... our own... K\u00f3lya, dear fellow... How he has changed!... Where are the candles?... Tea!...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd me, kiss me!\u201d\n\n\u201cDearest... and me!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya, Nat\u00e1sha, P\u00e9tya, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, V\u00e9ra, and the old count were all hugging him, and the serfs, men and maids, flocked into the room, exclaiming and oh-ing and ah-ing.\n\nP\u00e9tya, clinging to his legs, kept shouting, \u201cAnd me too!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha, after she had pulled him down toward her and covered his face with kisses, holding him tight by the skirt of his coat, sprang away and pranced up and down in one place like a goat and shrieked piercingly.\n\nAll around were loving eyes glistening with tears of joy, and all around were lips seeking a kiss.\n\nS\u00f3nya too, all rosy red, clung to his arm and, radiant with bliss, looked eagerly toward his eyes, waiting for the look for which she longed. S\u00f3nya now was sixteen and she was very pretty, especially at this moment of happy, rapturous excitement. She gazed at him, not taking her eyes off him, and smiling and holding her breath. He gave her a grateful look, but was still expectant and looking for someone. The old countess had not yet come. But now steps were heard at the door, steps so rapid that they could hardly be his mother\u2019s.\n\nYet it was she, dressed in a new gown which he did not know, made since he had left. All the others let him go, and he ran to her. When they met, she fell on his breast, sobbing. She could not lift her face, but only pressed it to the cold braiding of his hussar\u2019s jacket. Den\u00edsov, who had come into the room unnoticed by anyone, stood there and wiped his eyes at the sight.\n\n\u201cVas\u00edli Den\u00edsov, your son\u2019s friend,\u201d he said, introducing himself to the count, who was looking inquiringly at him.\n\n\u201cYou are most welcome! I know, I know,\u201d said the count, kissing and embracing Den\u00edsov. \u201cNicholas wrote us... Nat\u00e1sha, V\u00e9ra, look! Here is Den\u00edsov!\u201d\n\nThe same happy, rapturous faces turned to the shaggy figure of Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cDarling Den\u00edsov!\u201d screamed Nat\u00e1sha, beside herself with rapture, springing to him, putting her arms round him, and kissing him. This escapade made everybody feel confused. Den\u00edsov blushed too, but smiled and, taking Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s hand, kissed it.\n\nDen\u00edsov was shown to the room prepared for him, and the Rost\u00f3vs all gathered round Nicholas in the sitting room.\n\nThe old countess, not letting go of his hand and kissing it every moment, sat beside him: the rest, crowding round him, watched every movement, word, or look of his, never taking their blissfully adoring eyes off him. His brother and sisters struggled for the places nearest to him and disputed with one another who should bring him his tea, handkerchief, and pipe.\n\nRost\u00f3v was very happy in the love they showed him; but the first moment of meeting had been so beatific that his present joy seemed insufficient, and he kept expecting something more, more and yet more.\n\nNext morning, after the fatigues of their journey, the travelers slept till ten o\u2019clock.\n\nIn the room next to their bedroom there was a confusion of sabers, satchels, sabretaches, open portmanteaus, and dirty boots. Two freshly cleaned pairs with spurs had just been placed by the wall. The servants were bringing in jugs and basins, hot water for shaving, and their well-brushed clothes. There was a masculine odor and a smell of tobacco.\n\n\u201cHallo, Gw\u00edska\u2014my pipe!\u201d came Vas\u00edli Den\u00edsov\u2019s husky voice. \u201cWost\u00f3v, get up!\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, rubbing his eyes that seemed glued together, raised his disheveled head from the hot pillow.\n\n\u201cWhy, is it late?\u201d\n\n\u201cLate! It\u2019s nearly ten o\u2019clock,\u201d answered Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice. A rustle of starched petticoats and the whispering and laughter of girls\u2019 voices came from the adjoining room. The door was opened a crack and there was a glimpse of something blue, of ribbons, black hair, and merry faces. It was Nat\u00e1sha, S\u00f3nya, and P\u00e9tya, who had come to see whether they were getting up.\n\n\u201cNicholas! Get up!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice was again heard at the door.\n\n\u201cDirectly!\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, P\u00e9tya, having found and seized the sabers in the outer room, with the delight boys feel at the sight of a military elder brother, and forgetting that it was unbecoming for the girls to see men undressed, opened the bedroom door.\n\n\u201cIs this your saber?\u201d he shouted.\n\nThe girls sprang aside. Den\u00edsov hid his hairy legs under the blanket, looking with a scared face at his comrade for help. The door, having let P\u00e9tya in, closed again. A sound of laughter came from behind it.\n\n\u201cNicholas! Come out in your dressing gown!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice.\n\n\u201cIs this your saber?\u201d asked P\u00e9tya. \u201cOr is it yours?\u201d he said, addressing the black-mustached Den\u00edsov with servile deference.\n\nRost\u00f3v hurriedly put something on his feet, drew on his dressing gown, and went out. Nat\u00e1sha had put on one spurred boot and was just getting her foot into the other. S\u00f3nya, when he came in, was twirling round and was about to expand her dresses into a balloon and sit down. They were dressed alike, in new pale-blue frocks, and were both fresh, rosy, and bright. S\u00f3nya ran away, but Nat\u00e1sha, taking her brother\u2019s arm, led him into the sitting room, where they began talking. They hardly gave one another time to ask questions and give replies concerning a thousand little matters which could not interest anyone but themselves. Nat\u00e1sha laughed at every word he said or that she said herself, not because what they were saying was amusing, but because she felt happy and was unable to control her joy which expressed itself by laughter.\n\n\u201cOh, how nice, how splendid!\u201d she said to everything.\n\nRost\u00f3v felt that, under the influence of the warm rays of love, that childlike smile which had not once appeared on his face since he left home now for the first time after eighteen months again brightened his soul and his face.\n\n\u201cNo, but listen,\u201d she said, \u201cnow you are quite a man, aren\u2019t you? I\u2019m awfully glad you\u2019re my brother.\u201d She touched his mustache. \u201cI want to know what you men are like. Are you the same as we? No?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did S\u00f3nya run away?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cAh, yes! That\u2019s a whole long story! How are you going to speak to her\u2014thou or you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs may happen,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cNo, call her you, please! I\u2019ll tell you all about it some other time. No, I\u2019ll tell you now. You know S\u00f3nya\u2019s my dearest friend. Such a friend that I burned my arm for her sake. Look here!\u201d\n\nShe pulled up her muslin sleeve and showed him a red scar on her long, slender, delicate arm, high above the elbow on that part that is covered even by a ball dress.\n\n\u201cI burned this to prove my love for her. I just heated a ruler in the fire and pressed it there!\u201d\n\nSitting on the sofa with the little cushions on its arms, in what used to be his old schoolroom, and looking into Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wildly bright eyes, Rost\u00f3v re-entered that world of home and childhood which had no meaning for anyone else, but gave him some of the best joys of his life; and the burning of an arm with a ruler as a proof of love did not seem to him senseless, he understood and was not surprised at it.\n\n\u201cWell, and is that all?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWe are such friends, such friends! All that ruler business was just nonsense, but we are friends forever. She, if she loves anyone, does it for life, but I don\u2019t understand that, I forget quickly.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, she loves me and you like that.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha suddenly flushed.\n\n\u201cWhy, you remember before you went away?... Well, she says you are to forget all that.... She says: \u2018I shall love him always, but let him be free.\u2019 Isn\u2019t that lovely and noble! Yes, very noble? Isn\u2019t it?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, so seriously and excitedly that it was evident that what she was now saying she had talked of before, with tears.\n\nRost\u00f3v became thoughtful.\n\n\u201cI never go back on my word,\u201d he said. \u201cBesides, S\u00f3nya is so charming that only a fool would renounce such happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cshe and I have already talked it over. We knew you\u2019d say so. But it won\u2019t do, because you see, if you say that\u2014if you consider yourself bound by your promise\u2014it will seem as if she had not meant it seriously. It makes it as if you were marrying her because you must, and that wouldn\u2019t do at all.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v saw that it had been well considered by them. S\u00f3nya had already struck him by her beauty on the preceding day. Today, when he had caught a glimpse of her, she seemed still more lovely. She was a charming girl of sixteen, evidently passionately in love with him (he did not doubt that for an instant). Why should he not love her now, and even marry her, Rost\u00f3v thought, but just now there were so many other pleasures and interests before him! \u201cYes, they have taken a wise decision,\u201d he thought, \u201cI must remain free.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, that\u2019s excellent,\u201d said he. \u201cWe\u2019ll talk it over later on. Oh, how glad I am to have you!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and are you still true to Bor\u00eds?\u201d he continued.\n\n\u201cOh, what nonsense!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, laughing. \u201cI don\u2019t think about him or anyone else, and I don\u2019t want anything of the kind.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me! Then what are you up to now?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow?\u201d repeated Nat\u00e1sha, and a happy smile lit up her face. \u201cHave you seen Duport?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot seen Duport\u2014the famous dancer? Well then, you won\u2019t understand. That\u2019s what I\u2019m up to.\u201d\n\nCurving her arms, Nat\u00e1sha held out her skirts as dancers do, ran back a few steps, turned, cut a caper, brought her little feet sharply together, and made some steps on the very tips of her toes.\n\n\u201cSee, I\u2019m standing! See!\u201d she said, but could not maintain herself on her toes any longer. \u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m up to! I\u2019ll never marry anyone, but will be a dancer. Only don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v laughed so loud and merrily that Den\u00edsov, in his bedroom, felt envious and Nat\u00e1sha could not help joining in.\n\n\u201cNo, but don\u2019t you think it\u2019s nice?\u201d she kept repeating.\n\n\u201cNice! And so you no longer wish to marry Bor\u00eds?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha flared up. \u201cI don\u2019t want to marry anyone. And I\u2019ll tell him so when I see him!\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s all rubbish,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha chattered on. \u201cAnd is Den\u00edsov nice?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well then, good-by: go and dress. Is he very terrible, Den\u00edsov?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy terrible?\u201d asked Nicholas. \u201cNo, V\u00e1ska is a splendid fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou call him V\u00e1ska? That\u2019s funny! And is he very nice?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, be quick. We\u2019ll all have breakfast together.\u201d\n\nAnd Nat\u00e1sha rose and went out of the room on tiptoe, like a ballet dancer, but smiling as only happy girls of fifteen can smile. When Rost\u00f3v met S\u00f3nya in the drawing room, he reddened. He did not know how to behave with her. The evening before, in the first happy moment of meeting, they had kissed each other, but today they felt it could not be done; he felt that everybody, including his mother and sisters, was looking inquiringly at him and watching to see how he would behave with her. He kissed her hand and addressed her not as thou but as you\u2014S\u00f3nya. But their eyes met and said thou, and exchanged tender kisses. Her looks asked him to forgive her for having dared, by Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s intermediacy, to remind him of his promise, and then thanked him for his love. His looks thanked her for offering him his freedom and told her that one way or another he would never cease to love her, for that would be impossible.\n\n\u201cHow strange it is,\u201d said V\u00e9ra, selecting a moment when all were silent, \u201cthat S\u00f3nya and Nicholas now say you to one another and meet like strangers.\u201d\n\nV\u00e9ra\u2019s remark was correct, as her remarks always were, but, like most of her observations, it made everyone feel uncomfortable, not only S\u00f3nya, Nicholas, and Nat\u00e1sha, but even the old countess, who\u2014dreading this love affair which might hinder Nicholas from making a brilliant match\u2014blushed like a girl.\n\nDen\u00edsov, to Rost\u00f3v\u2019s surprise, appeared in the drawing room with pomaded hair, perfumed, and in a new uniform, looking just as smart as he made himself when going into battle, and he was more amiable to the ladies and gentlemen than Rost\u00f3v had ever expected to see him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOn his return to Moscow from the army, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v was welcomed by his home circle as the best of sons, a hero, and their darling Nik\u00f3lenka; by his relations as a charming, attractive, and polite young man; by his acquaintances as a handsome lieutenant of hussars, a good dancer, and one of the best matches in the city.\n\nThe Rost\u00f3vs knew everybody in Moscow. The old count had money enough that year, as all his estates had been remortgaged, and so Nicholas, acquiring a trotter of his own, very stylish riding breeches of the latest cut, such as no one else yet had in Moscow, and boots of the latest fashion, with extremely pointed toes and small silver spurs, passed his time very gaily. After a short period of adapting himself to the old conditions of life, Nicholas found it very pleasant to be at home again. He felt that he had grown up and matured very much. His despair at failing in a Scripture examination, his borrowing money from Gavr\u00edl to pay a sleigh driver, his kissing S\u00f3nya on the sly\u2014he now recalled all this as childishness he had left immeasurably behind. Now he was a lieutenant of hussars, in a jacket laced with silver, and wearing the Cross of St. George, awarded to soldiers for bravery in action, and in the company of well-known, elderly, and respected racing men was training a trotter of his own for a race. He knew a lady on one of the boulevards whom he visited of an evening. He led the mazurka at the Arkh\u00e1rovs\u2019 ball, talked about the war with Field Marshal K\u00e1menski, visited the English Club, and was on intimate terms with a colonel of forty to whom Den\u00edsov had introduced him.\n\nHis passion for the Emperor had cooled somewhat in Moscow. But still, as he did not see him and had no opportunity of seeing him, he often spoke about him and about his love for him, letting it be understood that he had not told all and that there was something in his feelings for the Emperor not everyone could understand, and with his whole soul he shared the adoration then common in Moscow for the Emperor, who was spoken of as the \u201cangel incarnate.\u201d\n\nDuring Rost\u00f3v\u2019s short stay in Moscow, before rejoining the army, he did not draw closer to S\u00f3nya, but rather drifted away from her. She was very pretty and sweet, and evidently deeply in love with him, but he was at the period of youth when there seems so much to do that there is no time for that sort of thing and a young man fears to bind himself and prizes his freedom which he needs for so many other things. When he thought of S\u00f3nya, during this stay in Moscow, he said to himself, \u201cAh, there will be, and there are, many more such girls somewhere whom I do not yet know. There will be time enough to think about love when I want to, but now I have no time.\u201d Besides, it seemed to him that the society of women was rather derogatory to his manhood. He went to balls and into ladies\u2019 society with an affectation of doing so against his will. The races, the English Club, sprees with Den\u00edsov, and visits to a certain house\u2014that was another matter and quite the thing for a dashing young hussar!\n\nAt the beginning of March, old Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v was very busy arranging a dinner in honor of Prince Bagrati\u00f3n at the English Club.\n\nThe count walked up and down the hall in his dressing gown, giving orders to the club steward and to the famous Feokt\u00edst, the club\u2019s head cook, about asparagus, fresh cucumbers, strawberries, veal, and fish for this dinner. The count had been a member and on the committee of the club from the day it was founded. To him the club entrusted the arrangement of the festival in honor of Bagrati\u00f3n, for few men knew so well how to arrange a feast on an open-handed, hospitable scale, and still fewer men would be so well able and willing to make up out of their own resources what might be needed for the success of the fete. The club cook and the steward listened to the count\u2019s orders with pleased faces, for they knew that under no other management could they so easily extract a good profit for themselves from a dinner costing several thousand rubles.\n\n\u201cWell then, mind and have cocks\u2019 comb in the turtle soup, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cShall we have three cold dishes then?\u201d asked the cook.\n\nThe count considered.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t have less\u2014yes, three... the mayonnaise, that\u2019s one,\u201d said he, bending down a finger.\n\n\u201cThen am I to order those large sterlets?\u201d asked the steward.\n\n\u201cYes, it can\u2019t be helped if they won\u2019t take less. Ah, dear me! I was forgetting. We must have another entr\u00e9e. Ah, goodness gracious!\u201d he clutched at his head. \u201cWho is going to get me the flowers? Dm\u00edtri! Eh, Dm\u00edtri! Gallop off to our Moscow estate,\u201d he said to the factotum who appeared at his call. \u201cHurry off and tell Maks\u00edm, the gardener, to set the serfs to work. Say that everything out of the hothouses must be brought here well wrapped up in felt. I must have two hundred pots here on Friday.\u201d\n\nHaving given several more orders, he was about to go to his \u201clittle countess\u201d to have a rest, but remembering something else of importance, he returned again, called back the cook and the club steward, and again began giving orders. A light footstep and the clinking of spurs were heard at the door, and the young count, handsome, rosy, with a dark little mustache, evidently rested and made sleeker by his easy life in Moscow, entered the room.\n\n\u201cAh, my boy, my head\u2019s in a whirl!\u201d said the old man with a smile, as if he felt a little confused before his son. \u201cNow, if you would only help a bit! I must have singers too. I shall have my own orchestra, but shouldn\u2019t we get the gypsy singers as well? You military men like that sort of thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally, Papa, I believe Prince Bagrati\u00f3n worried himself less before the battle of Sch\u00f6n Grabern than you do now,\u201d said his son with a smile.\n\nThe old count pretended to be angry.\n\n\u201cYes, you talk, but try it yourself!\u201d\n\nAnd the count turned to the cook, who, with a shrewd and respectful expression, looked observantly and sympathetically at the father and son.\n\n\u201cWhat have the young people come to nowadays, eh, Feokt\u00edst?\u201d said he. \u201cLaughing at us old fellows!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so, your excellency, all they have to do is to eat a good dinner, but providing it and serving it all up, that\u2019s not their business!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s it!\u201d exclaimed the count, and gaily seizing his son by both hands, he cried, \u201cNow I\u2019ve got you, so take the sleigh and pair at once, and go to Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s, and tell him \u2018Count Ily\u00e1 has sent you to ask for strawberries and fresh pineapples.\u2019 We can\u2019t get them from anyone else. He\u2019s not there himself, so you\u2019ll have to go in and ask the princesses; and from there go on to the Rasguly\u00e1y\u2014the coachman Ip\u00e1tka knows\u2014and look up the gypsy Ily\u00fashka, the one who danced at Count Orl\u00f3v\u2019s, you remember, in a white Cossack coat, and bring him along to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd am I to bring the gypsy girls along with him?\u201d asked Nicholas, laughing. \u201cDear, dear!...\u201d\n\nAt that moment, with noiseless footsteps and with the businesslike, preoccupied, yet meekly Christian look which never left her face, Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna entered the hall. Though she came upon the count in his dressing gown every day, he invariably became confused and begged her to excuse his costume.\n\n\u201cNo matter at all, my dear count,\u201d she said, meekly closing her eyes. \u201cBut I\u2019ll go to Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s myself. Pierre has arrived, and now we shall get anything we want from his hothouses. I have to see him in any case. He has forwarded me a letter from Bor\u00eds. Thank God, Bor\u00eds is now on the staff.\u201d\n\nThe count was delighted at Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s taking upon herself one of his commissions and ordered the small closed carriage for her.\n\n\u201cTell Bez\u00fakhov to come. I\u2019ll put his name down. Is his wife with him?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna turned up her eyes, and profound sadness was depicted on her face.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear friend, he is very unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cIf what we hear is true, it is dreadful. How little we dreamed of such a thing when we were rejoicing at his happiness! And such a lofty angelic soul as young Bez\u00fakhov! Yes, I pity him from my heart, and shall try to give him what consolation I can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWh-what is the matter?\u201d asked both the young and old Rost\u00f3v.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna sighed deeply.\n\n\u201cD\u00f3lokhov, Mary Iv\u00e1novna\u2019s son,\u201d she said in a mysterious whisper, \u201chas compromised her completely, they say. Pierre took him up, invited him to his house in Petersburg, and now... she has come here and that daredevil after her!\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, wishing to show her sympathy for Pierre, but by involuntary intonations and a half smile betraying her sympathy for the \u201cdaredevil,\u201d as she called D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cThey say Pierre is quite broken by his misfortune.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear, dear! But still tell him to come to the club\u2014it will all blow over. It will be a tremendous banquet.\u201d\n\nNext day, the third of March, soon after one o\u2019clock, two hundred and fifty members of the English Club and fifty guests were awaiting the guest of honor and hero of the Austrian campaign, Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, to dinner.\n\nOn the first arrival of the news of the battle of Austerlitz, Moscow had been bewildered. At that time, the Russians were so used to victories that on receiving news of the defeat some would simply not believe it, while others sought some extraordinary explanation of so strange an event. In the English Club, where all who were distinguished, important, and well informed foregathered when the news began to arrive in December, nothing was said about the war and the last battle, as though all were in a conspiracy of silence. The men who set the tone in conversation\u2014Count Rostopch\u00edn, Prince Y\u00fari Dolgor\u00fakov, Val\u00faev, Count Mark\u00f3v, and Prince Vy\u00e1zemski\u2014did not show themselves at the club, but met in private houses in intimate circles, and the Moscovites who took their opinions from others\u2014Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v among them\u2014remained for a while without any definite opinion on the subject of the war and without leaders. The Moscovites felt that something was wrong and that to discuss the bad news was difficult, and so it was best to be silent. But after a while, just as a jury comes out of its room, the bigwigs who guided the club\u2019s opinion reappeared, and everybody began speaking clearly and definitely. Reasons were found for the incredible, unheard-of, and impossible event of a Russian defeat, everything became clear, and in all corners of Moscow the same things began to be said. These reasons were the treachery of the Austrians, a defective commissariat, the treachery of the Pole Przebysz\u00e9wski and of the Frenchman Langeron, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s incapacity, and (it was whispered) the youth and inexperience of the sovereign, who had trusted worthless and insignificant people. But the army, the Russian army, everyone declared, was extraordinary and had achieved miracles of valor. The soldiers, officers, and generals were heroes. But the hero of heroes was Prince Bagrati\u00f3n, distinguished by his Sch\u00f6n Grabern affair and by the retreat from Austerlitz, where he alone had withdrawn his column unbroken and had all day beaten back an enemy force twice as numerous as his own. What also conduced to Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s being selected as Moscow\u2019s hero was the fact that he had no connections in the city and was a stranger there. In his person, honor was shown to a simple fighting Russian soldier without connections and intrigues, and to one who was associated by memories of the Italian campaign with the name of Suv\u00f3rov. Moreover, paying such honor to Bagrati\u00f3n was the best way of expressing disapproval and dislike of Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cHad there been no Bagrati\u00f3n, it would have been necessary to invent him,\u201d said the wit Shinsh\u00edn, parodying the words of Voltaire. Kut\u00fazov no one spoke of, except some who abused him in whispers, calling him a court weathercock and an old satyr.\n\nAll Moscow repeated Prince Dolgor\u00fakov\u2019s saying: \u201cIf you go on modeling and modeling you must get smeared with clay,\u201d suggesting consolation for our defeat by the memory of former victories; and the words of Rostopch\u00edn, that French soldiers have to be incited to battle by highfalutin words, and Germans by logical arguments to show them that it is more dangerous to run away than to advance, but that Russian soldiers only need to be restrained and held back! On all sides, new and fresh anecdotes were heard of individual examples of heroism shown by our officers and men at Austerlitz. One had saved a standard, another had killed five Frenchmen, a third had loaded five cannon singlehanded. Berg was mentioned, by those who did not know him, as having, when wounded in the right hand, taken his sword in the left, and gone forward. Of Bolk\u00f3nski, nothing was said, and only those who knew him intimately regretted that he had died so young, leaving a pregnant wife with his eccentric father.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn that third of March, all the rooms in the English Club were filled with a hum of conversation, like the hum of bees swarming in springtime. The members and guests of the club wandered hither and thither, sat, stood, met, and separated, some in uniform and some in evening dress, and a few here and there with powdered hair and in Russian kaft\u00e1ns. Powdered footmen, in livery with buckled shoes and smart stockings, stood at every door anxiously noting visitors\u2019 every movement in order to offer their services. Most of those present were elderly, respected men with broad, self-confident faces, fat fingers, and resolute gestures and voices. This class of guests and members sat in certain habitual places and met in certain habitual groups. A minority of those present were casual guests\u2014chiefly young men, among whom were Den\u00edsov, Rost\u00f3v, and D\u00f3lokhov\u2014who was now again an officer in the Sem\u00ebnov regiment. The faces of these young people, especially those who were military men, bore that expression of condescending respect for their elders which seems to say to the older generation, \u201cWe are prepared to respect and honor you, but all the same remember that the future belongs to us.\u201d\n\nNesv\u00edtski was there as an old member of the club. Pierre, who at his wife\u2019s command had let his hair grow and abandoned his spectacles, went about the rooms fashionably dressed but looking sad and dull. Here, as elsewhere, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of subservience to his wealth, and being in the habit of lording it over these people, he treated them with absent-minded contempt.\n\nBy his age he should have belonged to the younger men, but by his wealth and connections he belonged to the groups of old and honored guests, and so he went from one group to another. Some of the most important old men were the center of groups which even strangers approached respectfully to hear the voices of well-known men. The largest circles formed round Count Rostopch\u00edn, Val\u00faev, and Nar\u00fdshkin. Rostopch\u00edn was describing how the Russians had been overwhelmed by flying Austrians and had had to force their way through them with bayonets.\n\nVal\u00faev was confidentially telling that Uv\u00e1rov had been sent from Petersburg to ascertain what Moscow was thinking about Austerlitz.\n\nIn the third circle, Nar\u00fdshkin was speaking of the meeting of the Austrian Council of War at which Suv\u00f3rov crowed like a cock in reply to the nonsense talked by the Austrian generals. Shinsh\u00edn, standing close by, tried to make a joke, saying that Kut\u00fazov had evidently failed to learn from Suv\u00f3rov even so simple a thing as the art of crowing like a cock, but the elder members glanced severely at the wit, making him feel that in that place and on that day, it was improper to speak so of Kut\u00fazov.\n\nCount Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, hurried and preoccupied, went about in his soft boots between the dining and drawing rooms, hastily greeting the important and unimportant, all of whom he knew, as if they were all equals, while his eyes occasionally sought out his fine well-set-up young son, resting on him and winking joyfully at him. Young Rost\u00f3v stood at a window with D\u00f3lokhov, whose acquaintance he had lately made and highly valued. The old count came up to them and pressed D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cPlease come and visit us... you know my brave boy... been together out there... both playing the hero... Ah, Vas\u00edli Ign\u00e1tovich... How d\u2019ye do, old fellow?\u201d he said, turning to an old man who was passing, but before he had finished his greeting there was a general stir, and a footman who had run in announced, with a frightened face: \u201cHe\u2019s arrived!\u201d\n\nBells rang, the stewards rushed forward, and\u2014like rye shaken together in a shovel\u2014the guests who had been scattered about in different rooms came together and crowded in the large drawing room by the door of the ballroom.\n\nBagrati\u00f3n appeared in the doorway of the anteroom without hat or sword, which, in accord with the club custom, he had given up to the hall porter. He had no lambskin cap on his head, nor had he a loaded whip over his shoulder, as when Rost\u00f3v had seen him on the eve of the battle of Austerlitz, but wore a tight new uniform with Russian and foreign Orders, and the Star of St. George on his left breast. Evidently just before coming to the dinner he had had his hair and whiskers trimmed, which changed his appearance for the worse. There was something na\u00efvely festive in his air, which, in conjunction with his firm and virile features, gave him a rather comical expression. Beklesh\u00ebv and Theodore Uv\u00e1rov, who had arrived with him, paused at the doorway to allow him, as the guest of honor, to enter first. Bagrati\u00f3n was embarrassed, not wishing to avail himself of their courtesy, and this caused some delay at the doors, but after all he did at last enter first. He walked shyly and awkwardly over the parquet floor of the reception room, not knowing what to do with his hands; he was more accustomed to walk over a plowed field under fire, as he had done at the head of the Kursk regiment at Sch\u00f6n Grabern\u2014and he would have found that easier. The committeemen met him at the first door and, expressing their delight at seeing such a highly honored guest, took possession of him as it were, without waiting for his reply, surrounded him, and led him to the drawing room. It was at first impossible to enter the drawing room door for the crowd of members and guests jostling one another and trying to get a good look at Bagrati\u00f3n over each other\u2019s shoulders, as if he were some rare animal. Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, laughing and repeating the words, \u201cMake way, dear boy! Make way, make way!\u201d pushed through the crowd more energetically than anyone, led the guests into the drawing room, and seated them on the center sofa. The bigwigs, the most respected members of the club, beset the new arrivals. Count Ily\u00e1, again thrusting his way through the crowd, went out of the drawing room and reappeared a minute later with another committeeman, carrying a large silver salver which he presented to Prince Bagrati\u00f3n. On the salver lay some verses composed and printed in the hero\u2019s honor. Bagrati\u00f3n, on seeing the salver, glanced around in dismay, as though seeking help. But all eyes demanded that he should submit. Feeling himself in their power, he resolutely took the salver with both hands and looked sternly and reproachfully at the count who had presented it to him. Someone obligingly took the dish from Bagrati\u00f3n (or he would, it seemed, have held it till evening and have gone in to dinner with it) and drew his attention to the verses.\n\n\u201cWell, I will read them, then!\u201d Bagrati\u00f3n seemed to say, and, fixing his weary eyes on the paper, began to read them with a fixed and serious expression. But the author himself took the verses and began reading them aloud. Bagrati\u00f3n bowed his head and listened:\n\n\nBring glory then to Alexander\u2019s reign\nAnd on the throne our Titus shield.\nA dreaded foe be thou, kindhearted as a man,\nA Rhipheus at home, a Caesar in the field!\nE\u2019en fortunate Napoleon\nKnows by experience, now, Bagrati\u00f3n,\nAnd dare not Herculean Russians trouble...\n\n\nBut before he had finished reading, a stentorian major-domo announced that dinner was ready! The door opened, and from the dining room came the resounding strains of the polonaise:\n\n\nConquest\u2019s joyful thunder waken,\nTriumph, valiant Russians, now!...\n\n\nand Count Rost\u00f3v, glancing angrily at the author who went on reading his verses, bowed to Bagrati\u00f3n. Everyone rose, feeling that dinner was more important than verses, and Bagrati\u00f3n, again preceding all the rest, went in to dinner. He was seated in the place of honor between two Alexanders\u2014Beklesh\u00ebv and Nar\u00fdshkin\u2014which was a significant allusion to the name of the sovereign. Three hundred persons took their seats in the dining room, according to their rank and importance: the more important nearer to the honored guest, as naturally as water flows deepest where the land lies lowest.\n\nJust before dinner, Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v presented his son to Bagrati\u00f3n, who recognized him and said a few words to him, disjointed and awkward, as were all the words he spoke that day, and Count Ily\u00e1 looked joyfully and proudly around while Bagrati\u00f3n spoke to his son.\n\nNicholas Rost\u00f3v, with Den\u00edsov and his new acquaintance, D\u00f3lokhov, sat almost at the middle of the table. Facing them sat Pierre, beside Prince Nesv\u00edtski. Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v with the other members of the committee sat facing Bagrati\u00f3n and, as the very personification of Moscow hospitality, did the honors to the prince.\n\nHis efforts had not been in vain. The dinner, both the Lenten and the other fare, was splendid, yet he could not feel quite at ease till the end of the meal. He winked at the butler, whispered directions to the footmen, and awaited each expected dish with some anxiety. Everything was excellent. With the second course, a gigantic sterlet (at sight of which Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v blushed with self-conscious pleasure), the footmen began popping corks and filling the champagne glasses. After the fish, which made a certain sensation, the count exchanged glances with the other committeemen. \u201cThere will be many toasts, it\u2019s time to begin,\u201d he whispered, and taking up his glass, he rose. All were silent, waiting for what he would say.\n\n\u201cTo the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\u201d he cried, and at the same moment his kindly eyes grew moist with tears of joy and enthusiasm. The band immediately struck up \u201cConquest\u2019s joyful thunder waken...\u201d All rose and cried \u201cHurrah!\u201d Bagrati\u00f3n also rose and shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d in exactly the same voice in which he had shouted it on the field at Sch\u00f6n Grabern. Young Rost\u00f3v\u2019s ecstatic voice could be heard above the three hundred others. He nearly wept. \u201cTo the health of our Sovereign, the Emperor!\u201d he roared, \u201cHurrah!\u201d and emptying his glass at one gulp he dashed it to the floor. Many followed his example, and the loud shouting continued for a long time. When the voices subsided, the footmen cleared away the broken glass and everybody sat down again, smiling at the noise they had made and exchanging remarks. The old count rose once more, glanced at a note lying beside his plate, and proposed a toast, \u201cTo the health of the hero of our last campaign, Prince Peter Iv\u00e1novich Bagrati\u00f3n!\u201d and again his blue eyes grew moist. \u201cHurrah!\u201d cried the three hundred voices again, but instead of the band a choir began singing a cantata composed by Paul Iv\u00e1novich Kut\u00fazov:\n\n\nRussians! O\u2019er all barriers on!\nCourage conquest guarantees;\nHave we not Bagrati\u00f3n?\nHe brings foemen to their knees,... etc.\n\n\nAs soon as the singing was over, another and another toast was proposed and Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v became more and more moved, more glass was smashed, and the shouting grew louder. They drank to Beklesh\u00ebv, Nar\u00fdshkin, Uv\u00e1rov, Dolgor\u00fakov, Apr\u00e1ksin, Val\u00faev, to the committee, to all the club members and to all the club guests, and finally to Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v separately, as the organizer of the banquet. At that toast, the count took out his handkerchief and, covering his face, wept outright.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPierre sat opposite D\u00f3lokhov and Nicholas Rost\u00f3v. As usual, he ate and drank much, and eagerly. But those who knew him intimately noticed that some great change had come over him that day. He was silent all through dinner and looked about, blinking and scowling, or, with fixed eyes and a look of complete absent-mindedness, kept rubbing the bridge of his nose. His face was depressed and gloomy. He seemed to see and hear nothing of what was going on around him and to be absorbed by some depressing and unsolved problem.\n\nThe unsolved problem that tormented him was caused by hints given by the princess, his cousin, at Moscow, concerning D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s intimacy with his wife, and by an anonymous letter he had received that morning, which in the mean jocular way common to anonymous letters said that he saw badly through his spectacles, but that his wife\u2019s connection with D\u00f3lokhov was a secret to no one but himself. Pierre absolutely disbelieved both the princess\u2019 hints and the letter, but he feared now to look at D\u00f3lokhov, who was sitting opposite him. Every time he chanced to meet D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s handsome insolent eyes, Pierre felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul and turned quickly away. Involuntarily recalling his wife\u2019s past and her relations with D\u00f3lokhov, Pierre saw clearly that what was said in the letter might be true, or might at least seem to be true had it not referred to his wife. He involuntarily remembered how D\u00f3lokhov, who had fully recovered his former position after the campaign, had returned to Petersburg and come to him. Availing himself of his friendly relations with Pierre as a boon companion, D\u00f3lokhov had come straight to his house, and Pierre had put him up and lent him money. Pierre recalled how H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had smilingly expressed disapproval of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s living at their house, and how cynically D\u00f3lokhov had praised his wife\u2019s beauty to him and from that time till they came to Moscow had not left them for a day.\n\n\u201cYes, he is very handsome,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cand I know him. It would be particularly pleasant to him to dishonor my name and ridicule me, just because I have exerted myself on his behalf, befriended him, and helped him. I know and understand what a spice that would add to the pleasure of deceiving me, if it really were true. Yes, if it were true, but I do not believe it. I have no right to, and can\u2019t, believe it.\u201d He remembered the expression D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face assumed in his moments of cruelty, as when tying the policeman to the bear and dropping them into the water, or when he challenged a man to a duel without any reason, or shot a post-boy\u2019s horse with a pistol. That expression was often on D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face when looking at him. \u201cYes, he is a bully,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cto kill a man means nothing to him. It must seem to him that everyone is afraid of him, and that must please him. He must think that I, too, am afraid of him\u2014and in fact I am afraid of him,\u201d he thought, and again he felt something terrible and monstrous rising in his soul. D\u00f3lokhov, Den\u00edsov, and Rost\u00f3v were now sitting opposite Pierre and seemed very gay. Rost\u00f3v was talking merrily to his two friends, one of whom was a dashing hussar and the other a notorious duelist and rake, and every now and then he glanced ironically at Pierre, whose preoccupied, absent-minded, and massive figure was a very noticeable one at the dinner. Rost\u00f3v looked inimically at Pierre, first because Pierre appeared to his hussar eyes as a rich civilian, the husband of a beauty, and in a word\u2014an old woman; and secondly because Pierre in his preoccupation and absent-mindedness had not recognized Rost\u00f3v and had not responded to his greeting. When the Emperor\u2019s health was drunk, Pierre, lost in thought, did not rise or lift his glass.\n\n\u201cWhat are you about?\u201d shouted Rost\u00f3v, looking at him in an ecstasy of exasperation. \u201cDon\u2019t you hear it\u2019s His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s health?\u201d\n\nPierre sighed, rose submissively, emptied his glass, and, waiting till all were seated again, turned with his kindly smile to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWhy, I didn\u2019t recognize you!\u201d he said. But Rost\u00f3v was otherwise engaged; he was shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you renew the acquaintance?\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cConfound him, he\u2019s a fool!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cOne should make up to the husbands of pretty women,\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\nPierre did not catch what they were saying, but knew they were talking about him. He reddened and turned away.\n\n\u201cWell, now to the health of handsome women!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, and with a serious expression, but with a smile lurking at the corners of his mouth, he turned with his glass to Pierre.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s to the health of lovely women, Peterkin\u2014and their lovers!\u201d he added.\n\nPierre, with downcast eyes, drank out of his glass without looking at D\u00f3lokhov or answering him. The footman, who was distributing leaflets with Kut\u00fazov\u2019s cantata, laid one before Pierre as one of the principal guests. He was just going to take it when D\u00f3lokhov, leaning across, snatched it from his hand and began reading it. Pierre looked at D\u00f3lokhov and his eyes dropped, the something terrible and monstrous that had tormented him all dinnertime rose and took possession of him. He leaned his whole massive body across the table.\n\n\u201cHow dare you take it?\u201d he shouted.\n\nHearing that cry and seeing to whom it was addressed, Nesv\u00edtski and the neighbor on his right quickly turned in alarm to Bez\u00fakhov.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t! Don\u2019t! What are you about?\u201d whispered their frightened voices.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov looked at Pierre with clear, mirthful, cruel eyes, and that smile of his which seemed to say, \u201cAh! This is what I like!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou shan\u2019t have it!\u201d he said distinctly.\n\nPale, with quivering lips, Pierre snatched the copy.\n\n\u201cYou...! you... scoundrel! I challenge you!\u201d he ejaculated, and, pushing back his chair, he rose from the table.\n\nAt the very instant he did this and uttered those words, Pierre felt that the question of his wife\u2019s guilt which had been tormenting him the whole day was finally and indubitably answered in the affirmative. He hated her and was forever sundered from her. Despite Den\u00edsov\u2019s request that he would take no part in the matter, Rost\u00f3v agreed to be D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s second, and after dinner he discussed the arrangements for the duel with Nesv\u00edtski, Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s second. Pierre went home, but Rost\u00f3v with D\u00f3lokhov and Den\u00edsov stayed on at the club till late, listening to the gypsies and other singers.\n\n\u201cWell then, till tomorrow at Sok\u00f3lniki,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, as he took leave of Rost\u00f3v in the club porch.\n\n\u201cAnd do you feel quite calm?\u201d Rost\u00f3v asked.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov paused.\n\n\u201cWell, you see, I\u2019ll tell you the whole secret of dueling in two words. If you are going to fight a duel", "sequence": 7}, {"offset": 800000, "text": ", and you make a will and write affectionate letters to your parents, and if you think you may be killed, you are a fool and are lost for certain. But go with the firm intention of killing your man as quickly and surely as possible, and then all will be right, as our bear huntsman at Kostrom\u00e1 used to tell me. \u2018Everyone fears a bear,\u2019 he says, \u2018but when you see one your fear\u2019s all gone, and your only thought is not to let him get away!\u2019 And that\u2019s how it is with me. \u00c0 demain, mon cher.\u201d\n\nNext day, at eight in the morning, Pierre and Nesv\u00edtski drove to the Sok\u00f3lniki forest and found D\u00f3lokhov, Den\u00edsov, and Rost\u00f3v already there. Pierre had the air of a man preoccupied with considerations which had no connection with the matter in hand. His haggard face was yellow. He had evidently not slept that night. He looked about distractedly and screwed up his eyes as if dazzled by the sun. He was entirely absorbed by two considerations: his wife\u2019s guilt, of which after his sleepless night he had not the slightest doubt, and the guiltlessness of D\u00f3lokhov, who had no reason to preserve the honor of a man who was nothing to him.... \u201cI should perhaps have done the same thing in his place,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cIt\u2019s even certain that I should have done the same, then why this duel, this murder? Either I shall kill him, or he will hit me in the head, or elbow, or knee. Can\u2019t I go away from here, run away, bury myself somewhere?\u201d passed through his mind. But just at moments when such thoughts occurred to him, he would ask in a particularly calm and absent-minded way, which inspired the respect of the onlookers, \u201cWill it be long? Are things ready?\u201d\n\nWhen all was ready, the sabers stuck in the snow to mark the barriers, and the pistols loaded, Nesv\u00edtski went up to Pierre.\n\n\u201cI should not be doing my duty, Count,\u201d he said in timid tones, \u201cand should not justify your confidence and the honor you have done me in choosing me for your second, if at this grave, this very grave, moment I did not tell you the whole truth. I think there is no sufficient ground for this affair, or for blood to be shed over it.... You were not right, not quite in the right, you were impetuous...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, it is horribly stupid,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cThen allow me to express your regrets, and I am sure your opponent will accept them,\u201d said Nesv\u00edtski (who like the others concerned in the affair, and like everyone in similar cases, did not yet believe that the affair had come to an actual duel). \u201cYou know, Count, it is much more honorable to admit one\u2019s mistake than to let matters become irreparable. There was no insult on either side. Allow me to convey....\u201d\n\n\u201cNo! What is there to talk about?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same.... Is everything ready?\u201d he added. \u201cOnly tell me where to go and where to shoot,\u201d he said with an unnaturally gentle smile.\n\nHe took the pistol in his hand and began asking about the working of the trigger, as he had not before held a pistol in his hand\u2014a fact that he did not wish to confess.\n\n\u201cOh yes, like that, I know, I only forgot,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cNo apologies, none whatever,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov to Den\u00edsov (who on his side had been attempting a reconciliation), and he also went up to the appointed place.\n\nThe spot chosen for the duel was some eighty paces from the road, where the sleighs had been left, in a small clearing in the pine forest covered with melting snow, the frost having begun to break up during the last few days. The antagonists stood forty paces apart at the farther edge of the clearing. The seconds, measuring the paces, left tracks in the deep wet snow between the place where they had been standing and Nesv\u00edtski\u2019s and D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s sabers, which were stuck into the ground ten paces apart to mark the barrier. It was thawing and misty; at forty paces\u2019 distance nothing could be seen. For three minutes all had been ready, but they still delayed and all were silent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\n\u201cWell, begin!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cAll right,\u201d said Pierre, still smiling in the same way. A feeling of dread was in the air. It was evident that the affair so lightly begun could no longer be averted but was taking its course independently of men\u2019s will.\n\nDen\u00edsov first went to the barrier and announced: \u201cAs the adve\u2019sawies have wefused a weconciliation, please pwoceed. Take your pistols, and at the word thwee begin to advance.\n\n\u201cO-ne! T-wo! Thwee!\u201d he shouted angrily and stepped aside.\n\nThe combatants advanced along the trodden tracks, nearer and nearer to one another, beginning to see one another through the mist. They had the right to fire when they liked as they approached the barrier. D\u00f3lokhov walked slowly without raising his pistol, looking intently with his bright, sparkling blue eyes into his antagonist\u2019s face. His mouth wore its usual semblance of a smile.\n\n\u201cSo I can fire when I like!\u201d said Pierre, and at the word \u201cthree,\u201d he went quickly forward, missing the trodden path and stepping into the deep snow. He held the pistol in his right hand at arm\u2019s length, apparently afraid of shooting himself with it. His left hand he held carefully back, because he wished to support his right hand with it and knew he must not do so. Having advanced six paces and strayed off the track into the snow, Pierre looked down at his feet, then quickly glanced at D\u00f3lokhov and, bending his finger as he had been shown, fired. Not at all expecting so loud a report, Pierre shuddered at the sound and then, smiling at his own sensations, stood still. The smoke, rendered denser by the mist, prevented him from seeing anything for an instant, but there was no second report as he had expected. He only heard D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hurried steps, and his figure came in view through the smoke. He was pressing one hand to his left side, while the other clutched his drooping pistol. His face was pale. Rost\u00f3v ran toward him and said something.\n\n\u201cNo-o-o!\u201d muttered D\u00f3lokhov through his teeth, \u201cno, it\u2019s not over.\u201d And after stumbling a few staggering steps right up to the saber, he sank on the snow beside it. His left hand was bloody; he wiped it on his coat and supported himself with it. His frowning face was pallid and quivered.\n\n\u201cPlea...\u201d began D\u00f3lokhov, but could not at first pronounce the word.\n\n\u201cPlease,\u201d he uttered with an effort.\n\nPierre, hardly restraining his sobs, began running toward D\u00f3lokhov and was about to cross the space between the barriers, when D\u00f3lokhov cried:\n\n\u201cTo your barrier!\u201d and Pierre, grasping what was meant, stopped by his saber. Only ten paces divided them. D\u00f3lokhov lowered his head to the snow, greedily bit at it, again raised his head, adjusted himself, drew in his legs and sat up, seeking a firm center of gravity. He sucked and swallowed the cold snow, his lips quivered but his eyes, still smiling, glittered with effort and exasperation as he mustered his remaining strength. He raised his pistol and aimed.\n\n\u201cSideways! Cover yourself with your pistol!\u201d ejaculated Nesv\u00edtski.\n\n\u201cCover yourself!\u201d even Den\u00edsov cried to his adversary.\n\nPierre, with a gentle smile of pity and remorse, his arms and legs helplessly spread out, stood with his broad chest directly facing D\u00f3lokhov and looked sorrowfully at him. Den\u00edsov, Rost\u00f3v, and Nesv\u00edtski closed their eyes. At the same instant they heard a report and D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s angry cry.\n\n\u201cMissed!\u201d shouted D\u00f3lokhov, and he lay helplessly, face downwards on the snow.\n\nPierre clutched his temples, and turning round went into the forest, trampling through the deep snow, and muttering incoherent words:\n\n\u201cFolly... folly! Death... lies...\u201d he repeated, puckering his face.\n\nNesv\u00edtski stopped him and took him home.\n\nRost\u00f3v and Den\u00edsov drove away with the wounded D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nThe latter lay silent in the sleigh with closed eyes and did not answer a word to the questions addressed to him. But on entering Moscow he suddenly came to and, lifting his head with an effort, took Rost\u00f3v, who was sitting beside him, by the hand. Rost\u00f3v was struck by the totally altered and unexpectedly rapturous and tender expression on D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWell? How do you feel?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBad! But it\u2019s not that, my friend\u2014\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov with a gasping voice. \u201cWhere are we? In Moscow, I know. I don\u2019t matter, but I have killed her, killed... She won\u2019t get over it! She won\u2019t survive....\u201d\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cMy mother! My mother, my angel, my adored angel mother,\u201d and D\u00f3lokhov pressed Rost\u00f3v\u2019s hand and burst into tears.\n\nWhen he had become a little quieter, he explained to Rost\u00f3v that he was living with his mother, who, if she saw him dying, would not survive it. He implored Rost\u00f3v to go on and prepare her.\n\nRost\u00f3v went on ahead to do what was asked, and to his great surprise learned that D\u00f3lokhov the brawler, D\u00f3lokhov the bully, lived in Moscow with an old mother and a hunchback sister, and was the most affectionate of sons and brothers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nPierre had of late rarely seen his wife alone. Both in Petersburg and in Moscow their house was always full of visitors. The night after the duel he did not go to his bedroom but, as he often did, remained in his father\u2019s room, that huge room in which Count Bez\u00fakhov had died.\n\nHe lay down on the sofa meaning to fall asleep and forget all that had happened to him, but could not do so. Such a storm of feelings, thoughts, and memories suddenly arose within him that he could not fall asleep, nor even remain in one place, but had to jump up and pace the room with rapid steps. Now he seemed to see her in the early days of their marriage, with bare shoulders and a languid, passionate look on her face, and then immediately he saw beside her D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s handsome, insolent, hard, and mocking face as he had seen it at the banquet, and then that same face pale, quivering, and suffering, as it had been when he reeled and sank on the snow.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cI have killed her lover, yes, killed my wife\u2019s lover. Yes, that was it! And why? How did I come to do it?\u201d\u2014\u201cBecause you married her,\u201d answered an inner voice.\n\n\u201cBut in what was I to blame?\u201d he asked. \u201cIn marrying her without loving her; in deceiving yourself and her.\u201d And he vividly recalled that moment after supper at Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s, when he spoke those words he had found so difficult to utter: \u201cI love you.\u201d \u201cIt all comes from that! Even then I felt it,\u201d he thought. \u201cI felt then that it was not so, that I had no right to do it. And so it turns out.\u201d\n\nHe remembered his honeymoon and blushed at the recollection. Particularly vivid, humiliating, and shameful was the recollection of how one day soon after his marriage he came out of the bedroom into his study a little before noon in his silk dressing gown and found his head steward there, who, bowing respectfully, looked into his face and at his dressing gown and smiled slightly, as if expressing respectful understanding of his employer\u2019s happiness.\n\n\u201cBut how often I have felt proud of her, proud of her majestic beauty and social tact,\u201d thought he; \u201cbeen proud of my house, in which she received all Petersburg, proud of her unapproachability and beauty. So this is what I was proud of! I then thought that I did not understand her. How often when considering her character I have told myself that I was to blame for not understanding her, for not understanding that constant composure and complacency and lack of all interests or desires, and the whole secret lies in the terrible truth that she is a depraved woman. Now I have spoken that terrible word to myself all has become clear.\n\n\u201cAnatole used to come to borrow money from her and used to kiss her naked shoulders. She did not give him the money, but let herself be kissed. Her father in jest tried to rouse her jealousy, and she replied with a calm smile that she was not so stupid as to be jealous: \u2018Let him do what he pleases,\u2019 she used to say of me. One day I asked her if she felt any symptoms of pregnancy. She laughed contemptuously and said she was not a fool to want to have children, and that she was not going to have any children by me.\u201d\n\nThen he recalled the coarseness and bluntness of her thoughts and the vulgarity of the expressions that were natural to her, though she had been brought up in the most aristocratic circles.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not such a fool.... Just you try it on.... Allez-vous promener,\u201d she used to say. Often seeing the success she had with young and old men and women Pierre could not understand why he did not love her.\n\n\u201cYes, I never loved her,\u201d said he to himself; \u201cI knew she was a depraved woman,\u201d he repeated, \u201cbut dared not admit it to myself. And now there\u2019s D\u00f3lokhov sitting in the snow with a forced smile and perhaps dying, while meeting my remorse with some forced bravado!\u201d\n\nPierre was one of those people who, in spite of an appearance of what is called weak character, do not seek a confidant in their troubles. He digested his sufferings alone.\n\n\u201cIt is all, all her fault,\u201d he said to himself; \u201cbut what of that? Why did I bind myself to her? Why did I say \u2018Je vous aime\u2019 to her, which was a lie, and worse than a lie? I am guilty and must endure... what? A slur on my name? A misfortune for life? Oh, that\u2019s nonsense,\u201d he thought. \u201cThe slur on my name and honor\u2014that\u2019s all apart from myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cLouis XVI was executed because they said he was dishonorable and a criminal,\u201d came into Pierre\u2019s head, \u201cand from their point of view they were right, as were those too who canonized him and died a martyr\u2019s death for his sake. Then Robespierre was beheaded for being a despot. Who is right and who is wrong? No one! But if you are alive\u2014live: tomorrow you\u2019ll die as I might have died an hour ago. And is it worth tormenting oneself, when one has only a moment of life in comparison with eternity?\u201d\n\nBut at the moment when he imagined himself calmed by such reflections, she suddenly came into his mind as she was at the moments when he had most strongly expressed his insincere love for her, and he felt the blood rush to his heart and had again to get up and move about and break and tear whatever came to his hand. \u201cWhy did I tell her that \u2018Je vous aime\u2019?\u201d he kept repeating to himself. And when he had said it for the tenth time, Moli\u00e8re\u2019s words: \u201cMais que diable allait-il faire dans cette gal\u00e8re?\u201d occurred to him, and he began to laugh at himself.\n\nIn the night he called his valet and told him to pack up to go to Petersburg. He could not imagine how he could speak to her now. He resolved to go away next day and leave a letter informing her of his intention to part from her forever.\n\nNext morning when the valet came into the room with his coffee, Pierre was lying asleep on the ottoman with an open book in his hand.\n\nHe woke up and looked round for a while with a startled expression, unable to realize where he was.\n\n\u201cThe countess told me to inquire whether your excellency was at home,\u201d said the valet.\n\nBut before Pierre could decide what answer he would send, the countess herself in a white satin dressing gown embroidered with silver and with simply dressed hair (two immense plaits twice round her lovely head like a coronet) entered the room, calm and majestic, except that there was a wrathful wrinkle on her rather prominent marble brow. With her imperturbable calm she did not begin to speak in front of the valet. She knew of the duel and had come to speak about it. She waited till the valet had set down the coffee things and left the room. Pierre looked at her timidly over his spectacles, and like a hare surrounded by hounds who lays back her ears and continues to crouch motionless before her enemies, he tried to continue reading. But feeling this to be senseless and impossible, he again glanced timidly at her. She did not sit down but looked at him with a contemptuous smile, waiting for the valet to go.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s this now? What have you been up to now, I should like to know?\u201d she asked sternly.\n\n\u201cI? What have I...?\u201d stammered Pierre.\n\n\u201cSo it seems you\u2019re a hero, eh? Come now, what was this duel about? What is it meant to prove? What? I ask you.\u201d\n\nPierre turned over heavily on the ottoman and opened his mouth, but could not reply.\n\n\u201cIf you won\u2019t answer, I\u2019ll tell you...\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne went on. \u201cYou believe everything you\u2019re told. You were told...\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne laughed, \u201cthat D\u00f3lokhov was my lover,\u201d she said in French with her coarse plainness of speech, uttering the word amant as casually as any other word, \u201cand you believed it! Well, what have you proved? What does this duel prove? That you\u2019re a fool, que vous \u00eates un sot, but everybody knew that. What will be the result? That I shall be the laughingstock of all Moscow, that everyone will say that you, drunk and not knowing what you were about, challenged a man you are jealous of without cause.\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne raised her voice and became more and more excited, \u201cA man who\u2019s a better man than you in every way...\u201d\n\n\u201cHm... Hm...!\u201d growled Pierre, frowning without looking at her, and not moving a muscle.\n\n\u201cAnd how could you believe he was my lover? Why? Because I like his company? If you were cleverer and more agreeable, I should prefer yours.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me... I beg you,\u201d muttered Pierre hoarsely.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I speak? I can speak as I like, and I tell you plainly that there are not many wives with husbands such as you who would not have taken lovers (des amants), but I have not done so,\u201d said she.\n\nPierre wished to say something, looked at her with eyes whose strange expression she did not understand, and lay down again. He was suffering physically at that moment, there was a weight on his chest and he could not breathe. He knew that he must do something to put an end to this suffering, but what he wanted to do was too terrible.\n\n\u201cWe had better separate,\u201d he muttered in a broken voice.\n\n\u201cSeparate? Very well, but only if you give me a fortune,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cSeparate! That\u2019s a thing to frighten me with!\u201d\n\nPierre leaped up from the sofa and rushed staggering toward her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll kill you!\u201d he shouted, and seizing the marble top of a table with a strength he had never before felt, he made a step toward her brandishing the slab.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s face became terrible, she shrieked and sprang aside. His father\u2019s nature showed itself in Pierre. He felt the fascination and delight of frenzy. He flung down the slab, broke it, and swooping down on her with outstretched hands shouted, \u201cGet out!\u201d in such a terrible voice that the whole house heard it with horror. God knows what he would have done at that moment had H\u00e9l\u00e8ne not fled from the room.\n\n\nA week later Pierre gave his wife full power to control all his estates in Great Russia, which formed the larger part of his property, and left for Petersburg alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nTwo months had elapsed since the news of the battle of Austerlitz and the loss of Prince Andrew had reached Bald Hills, and in spite of the letters sent through the embassy and all the searches made, his body had not been found nor was he on the list of prisoners. What was worst of all for his relations was the fact that there was still a possibility of his having been picked up on the battlefield by the people of the place and that he might now be lying, recovering or dying, alone among strangers and unable to send news of himself. The gazettes from which the old prince first heard of the defeat at Austerlitz stated, as usual very briefly and vaguely, that after brilliant engagements the Russians had had to retreat and had made their withdrawal in perfect order. The old prince understood from this official report that our army had been defeated. A week after the gazette report of the battle of Austerlitz came a letter from Kut\u00fazov informing the prince of the fate that had befallen his son.\n\n\u201cYour son,\u201d wrote Kut\u00fazov, \u201cfell before my eyes, a standard in his hand and at the head of a regiment\u2014he fell as a hero, worthy of his father and his fatherland. To the great regret of myself and of the whole army it is still uncertain whether he is alive or not. I comfort myself and you with the hope that your son is alive, for otherwise he would have been mentioned among the officers found on the field of battle, a list of whom has been sent me under flag of truce.\u201d\n\nAfter receiving this news late in the evening, when he was alone in his study, the old prince went for his walk as usual next morning, but he was silent with his steward, the gardener, and the architect, and though he looked very grim he said nothing to anyone.\n\nWhen Princess Mary went to him at the usual hour he was working at his lathe and, as usual, did not look round at her.\n\n\u201cAh, Princess Mary!\u201d he said suddenly in an unnatural voice, throwing down his chisel. (The wheel continued to revolve by its own impetus, and Princess Mary long remembered the dying creak of that wheel, which merged in her memory with what followed.)\n\nShe approached him, saw his face, and something gave way within her. Her eyes grew dim. By the expression of her father\u2019s face, not sad, not crushed, but angry and working unnaturally, she saw that hanging over her and about to crush her was some terrible misfortune, the worst in life, one she had not yet experienced, irreparable and incomprehensible\u2014the death of one she loved.\n\n\u201cFather! Andrew!\u201d\u2014said the ungraceful, awkward princess with such an indescribable charm of sorrow and self-forgetfulness that her father could not bear her look but turned away with a sob.\n\n\u201cBad news! He\u2019s not among the prisoners nor among the killed! Kut\u00fazov writes...\u201d and he screamed as piercingly as if he wished to drive the princess away by that scream... \u201cKilled!\u201d\n\nThe princess did not fall down or faint. She was already pale, but on hearing these words her face changed and something brightened in her beautiful, radiant eyes. It was as if joy\u2014a supreme joy apart from the joys and sorrows of this world\u2014overflowed the great grief within her. She forgot all fear of her father, went up to him, took his hand, and drawing him down put her arm round his thin, scraggy neck.\n\n\u201cFather,\u201d she said, \u201cdo not turn away from me, let us weep together.\u201d\n\n\u201cScoundrels! Blackguards!\u201d shrieked the old man, turning his face away from her. \u201cDestroying the army, destroying the men! And why? Go, go and tell Lise.\u201d\n\nThe princess sank helplessly into an armchair beside her father and wept. She saw her brother now as he had been at the moment when he took leave of her and of Lise, his look tender yet proud. She saw him tender and amused as he was when he put on the little icon. \u201cDid he believe? Had he repented of his unbelief? Was he now there? There in the realms of eternal peace and blessedness?\u201d she thought.\n\n\u201cFather, tell me how it happened,\u201d she asked through her tears.\n\n\u201cGo! Go! Killed in battle, where the best of Russian men and Russia\u2019s glory were led to destruction. Go, Princess Mary. Go and tell Lise. I will follow.\u201d\n\nWhen Princess Mary returned from her father, the little princess sat working and looked up with that curious expression of inner, happy calm peculiar to pregnant women. It was evident that her eyes did not see Princess Mary but were looking within... into herself... at something joyful and mysterious taking place within her.\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d she said, moving away from the embroidery frame and lying back, \u201cgive me your hand.\u201d She took her sister-in-law\u2019s hand and held it below her waist.\n\nHer eyes were smiling expectantly, her downy lip rose and remained lifted in childlike happiness.\n\nPrincess Mary knelt down before her and hid her face in the folds of her sister-in-law\u2019s dress.\n\n\u201cThere, there! Do you feel it? I feel so strange. And do you know, Mary, I am going to love him very much,\u201d said Lise, looking with bright and happy eyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nPrincess Mary could not lift her head, she was weeping.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter, Mary?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing... only I feel sad... sad about Andrew,\u201d she said, wiping away her tears on her sister-in-law\u2019s knee.\n\nSeveral times in the course of the morning Princess Mary began trying to prepare her sister-in-law, and every time began to cry. Unobservant as was the little princess, these tears, the cause of which she did not understand, agitated her. She said nothing but looked about uneasily as if in search of something. Before dinner the old prince, of whom she was always afraid, came into her room with a peculiarly restless and malign expression and went out again without saying a word. She looked at Princess Mary, then sat thinking for a while with that expression of attention to something within her that is only seen in pregnant women, and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\u201cHas anything come from Andrew?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, you know it\u2019s too soon for news. But my father is anxious and I feel afraid.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo there\u2019s nothing?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d answered Princess Mary, looking firmly with her radiant eyes at her sister-in-law.\n\nShe had determined not to tell her and persuaded her father to hide the terrible news from her till after her confinement, which was expected within a few days. Princess Mary and the old prince each bore and hid their grief in their own way. The old prince would not cherish any hope: he made up his mind that Prince Andrew had been killed, and though he sent an official to Austria to seek for traces of his son, he ordered a monument from Moscow which he intended to erect in his own garden to his memory, and he told everybody that his son had been killed. He tried not to change his former way of life, but his strength failed him. He walked less, ate less, slept less, and became weaker every day. Princess Mary hoped. She prayed for her brother as living and was always awaiting news of his return.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\n\u201cDearest,\u201d said the little princess after breakfast on the morning of the nineteenth March, and her downy little lip rose from old habit, but as sorrow was manifest in every smile, the sound of every word, and even every footstep in that house since the terrible news had come, so now the smile of the little princess\u2014influenced by the general mood though without knowing its cause\u2014was such as to remind one still more of the general sorrow.\n\n\u201cDearest, I\u2019m afraid this morning\u2019s fruschtique\u2014as F\u00f3ka the cook calls it\u2014has disagreed with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter with you, my darling? You look pale. Oh, you are very pale!\u201d said Princess Mary in alarm, running with her soft, ponderous steps up to her sister-in-law.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, should not Mary Bogd\u00e1novna be sent for?\u201d said one of the maids who was present. (Mary Bogd\u00e1novna was a midwife from the neighboring town, who had been at Bald Hills for the last fortnight.)\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d assented Princess Mary, \u201cperhaps that\u2019s it. I\u2019ll go. Courage, my angel.\u201d She kissed Lise and was about to leave the room.\n\n\u201cOh, no, no!\u201d And besides the pallor and the physical suffering on the little princess\u2019 face, an expression of childish fear of inevitable pain showed itself.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s only indigestion?... Say it\u2019s only indigestion, say so, Mary! Say...\u201d And the little princess began to cry capriciously like a suffering child and to wring her little hands even with some affectation. Princess Mary ran out of the room to fetch Mary Bogd\u00e1novna.\n\n\u201cMon Dieu! Mon Dieu! Oh!\u201d she heard as she left the room.\n\nThe midwife was already on her way to meet her, rubbing her small, plump white hands with an air of calm importance.\n\n\u201cMary Bogd\u00e1novna, I think it\u2019s beginning!\u201d said Princess Mary looking at the midwife with wide-open eyes of alarm.\n\n\u201cWell, the Lord be thanked, Princess,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna, not hastening her steps. \u201cYou young ladies should not know anything about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how is it the doctor from Moscow is not here yet?\u201d said the princess. (In accordance with Lise\u2019s and Prince Andrew\u2019s wishes they had sent in good time to Moscow for a doctor and were expecting him at any moment.)\n\n\u201cNo matter, Princess, don\u2019t be alarmed,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna. \u201cWe\u2019ll manage very well without a doctor.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later Princess Mary from her room heard something heavy being carried by. She looked out. The men servants were carrying the large leather sofa from Prince Andrew\u2019s study into the bedroom. On their faces was a quiet and solemn look.\n\nPrincess Mary sat alone in her room listening to the sounds in the house, now and then opening her door when someone passed and watching what was going on in the passage. Some women passing with quiet steps in and out of the bedroom glanced at the princess and turned away. She did not venture to ask any questions, and shut the door again, now sitting down in her easy chair, now taking her prayer book, now kneeling before the icon stand. To her surprise and distress she found that her prayers did not calm her excitement. Suddenly her door opened softly and her old nurse, Prask\u00f3vya S\u00e1vishna, who hardly ever came to that room as the old prince had forbidden it, appeared on the threshold with a shawl round her head.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come to sit with you a bit, M\u00e1sha,\u201d said the nurse, \u201cand here I\u2019ve brought the prince\u2019s wedding candles to light before his saint, my angel,\u201d she said with a sigh.\n\n\u201cOh, nurse, I\u2019m so glad!\u201d\n\n\u201cGod is merciful, birdie.\u201d\n\nThe nurse lit the gilt candles before the icons and sat down by the door with her knitting. Princess Mary took a book and began reading. Only when footsteps or voices were heard did they look at one another, the princess anxious and inquiring, the nurse encouraging. Everyone in the house was dominated by the same feeling that Princess Mary experienced as she sat in her room. But owing to the superstition that the fewer the people who know of it the less a woman in travail suffers, everyone tried to pretend not to know; no one spoke of it, but apart from the ordinary staid and respectful good manners habitual in the prince\u2019s household, a common anxiety, a softening of the heart, and a consciousness that something great and mysterious was being accomplished at that moment made itself felt.\n\nThere was no laughter in the maids\u2019 large hall. In the men servants\u2019 hall all sat waiting, silently and alert. In the outlying serfs\u2019 quarters torches and candles were burning and no one slept. The old prince, stepping on his heels, paced up and down his study and sent T\u00edkhon to ask Mary Bogd\u00e1novna what news.\u2014\u201cSay only that \u2018the prince told me to ask,\u2019 and come and tell me her answer.\u201d\n\n\u201cInform the prince that labor has begun,\u201d said Mary Bogd\u00e1novna, giving the messenger a significant look.\n\nT\u00edkhon went and told the prince.\n\n\u201cVery good!\u201d said the prince closing the door behind him, and T\u00edkhon did not hear the slightest sound from the study after that.\n\nAfter a while he re-entered it as if to snuff the candles, and, seeing the prince was lying on the sofa, looked at him, noticed his perturbed face, shook his head, and going up to him silently kissed him on the shoulder and left the room without snuffing the candles or saying why he had entered. The most solemn mystery in the world continued its course. Evening passed, night came, and the feeling of suspense and softening of heart in the presence of the unfathomable did not lessen but increased. No one slept.\n\nIt was one of those March nights when winter seems to wish to resume its sway and scatters its last snows and storms with desperate fury. A relay of horses had been sent up the highroad to meet the German doctor from Moscow who was expected every moment, and men on horseback with lanterns were sent to the crossroads to guide him over the country road with its hollows and snow-covered pools of water.\n\nPrincess Mary had long since put aside her book: she sat silent, her luminous eyes fixed on her nurse\u2019s wrinkled face (every line of which she knew so well), on the lock of gray hair that escaped from under the kerchief, and the loose skin that hung under her chin.\n\nNurse S\u00e1vishna, knitting in hand, was telling in low tones, scarcely hearing or understanding her own words, what she had told hundreds of times before: how the late princess had given birth to Princess Mary in Kishen\u00ebv with only a Moldavian peasant woman to help instead of a midwife.\n\n\u201cGod is merciful, doctors are never needed,\u201d she said.\n\nSuddenly a gust of wind beat violently against the casement of the window, from which the double frame had been removed (by order of the prince, one window frame was removed in each room as soon as the larks returned), and, forcing open a loosely closed latch, set the damask curtain flapping and blew out the candle with its chill, snowy draft. Princess Mary shuddered; her nurse, putting down the stocking she was knitting, went to the window and leaning out tried to catch the open casement. The cold wind flapped the ends of her kerchief and her loose locks of gray hair.\n\n\u201cPrincess, my dear, there\u2019s someone driving up the avenue!\u201d she said, holding the casement and not closing it. \u201cWith lanterns. Most likely the doctor.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my God! thank God!\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI must go and meet him, he does not know Russian.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary threw a shawl over her head and ran to meet the newcomer. As she was crossing the anteroom she saw through the window a carriage with lanterns, standing at the entrance. She went out on the stairs. On a banister post stood a tallow candle which guttered in the draft. On the landing below, Philip, the footman, stood looking scared and holding another candle. Still lower, beyond the turn of the staircase, one could hear the footstep of someone in thick felt boots, and a voice that seemed familiar to Princess Mary was saying something.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d said the voice. \u201cAnd Father?\u201d\n\n\u201cGone to bed,\u201d replied the voice of Demy\u00e1n the house steward, who was downstairs.\n\nThen the voice said something more, Demy\u00e1n replied, and the steps in the felt boots approached the unseen bend of the staircase more rapidly.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Andrew!\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cNo it can\u2019t be, that would be too extraordinary,\u201d and at the very moment she thought this, the face and figure of Prince Andrew, in a fur cloak the deep collar of which covered with snow, appeared on the landing where the footman stood with the candle. Yes, it was he, pale, thin, with a changed and strangely softened but agitated expression on his face. He came up the stairs and embraced his sister.\n\n\u201cYou did not get my letter?\u201d he asked, and not waiting for a reply\u2014which he would not have received, for the princess was unable to speak\u2014he turned back, rapidly mounted the stairs again with the doctor who had entered the hall after him (they had met at the last post station), and again embraced his sister.\n\n\u201cWhat a strange fate, M\u00e1sha darling!\u201d And having taken off his cloak and felt boots, he went to the little princess\u2019 apartment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe little princess lay supported by pillows, with a white cap on her head (the pains had just left her). Strands of her black hair lay round her inflamed and perspiring cheeks, her charming rosy mouth with its downy lip was open and she was smiling joyfully. Prince Andrew entered and paused facing her at the foot of the sofa on which she was lying. Her glittering eyes, filled with childlike fear and excitement, rested on him without changing their expression. \u201cI love you all and have done no harm to anyone; why must I suffer so? Help me!\u201d her look seemed to say. She saw her husband, but did not realize the significance of his appearance before her now. Prince Andrew went round the sofa and kissed her forehead.\n\n\u201cMy darling!\u201d he said\u2014a word he had never used to her before. \u201cGod is merciful....\u201d\n\nShe looked at him inquiringly and with childlike reproach.\n\n\u201cI expected help from you and I get none, none from you either!\u201d said her eyes. She was not surprised at his having come; she did not realize that he had come. His coming had nothing to do with her sufferings or with their relief. The pangs began again and Mary Bogd\u00e1novna advised Prince Andrew to leave the room.\n\nThe doctor entered. Prince Andrew went out and, meeting Princess Mary, again joined her. They began talking in whispers, but their talk broke off at every moment. They waited and listened.\n\n\u201cGo, dear,\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nPrince Andrew went again to his wife and sat waiting in the room next to hers. A woman came from the bedroom with a frightened face and became confused when she saw Prince Andrew. He covered his face with his hands and remained so for some minutes. Piteous, helpless, animal moans came through the door. Prince Andrew got up, went to the door, and tried to open it. Someone was holding it shut.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t come in! You can\u2019t!\u201d said a terrified voice from within.\n\nHe began pacing the room. The screaming ceased, and a few more seconds went by. Then suddenly a terrible shriek\u2014it could not be hers, she could not scream like that\u2014came from the bedroom. Prince Andrew ran to the door; the scream ceased and he heard the wail of an infant.\n\n\u201cWhat have they taken a baby in there for?\u201d thought Prince Andrew in the first second. \u201cA baby? What baby...? Why is there a baby there? Or is the baby born?\u201d\n\nThen suddenly he realized the joyful significance of that wail; tears choked him, and leaning his elbows on the window sill he began to cry, sobbing like a child. The door opened. The doctor with his shirt sleeves tucked up, without a coat, pale and with a trembling jaw, came out of the room. Prince Andrew turned to him, but the doctor gave him a bewildered look and passed by without a word. A woman rushed out and seeing Prince Andrew stopped, hesitating on the threshold. He went into his wife\u2019s room. She was lying dead, in the same position he had seen her in five minutes before and, despite the fixed eyes and the pallor of the cheeks, the same expression was on her charming childlike face with its upper lip covered with tiny black hair.\n\n\u201cI love you all, and have done no harm to anyone; and what have you done to me?\u201d\u2014said her charming, pathetic, dead face.\n\nIn a corner of the room something red and tiny gave a grunt and squealed in Mary Bogd\u00e1novna\u2019s trembling white hands.\n\n\nTwo hours later Prince Andrew, stepping softly, went into his father\u2019s room. The old man already knew everything. He was standing close to the door and as soon as it opened his rough old arms closed like a vise round his son\u2019s neck, and without a word he began to sob like a child.\n\n\nThree days later the little princess was buried, and Prince Andrew went up the steps to where the coffin stood, to give her the farewell kiss. And there in the coffin was the same face, though with closed eyes. \u201cAh, what have you done to me?\u201d it still seemed to say, and Prince Andrew felt that something gave way in his soul and that he was guilty of a sin he could neither remedy nor forget. He could not weep. The old man too came up and kissed the waxen little hands that lay quietly crossed one on the other on her breast, and to him, too, her face seemed to say: \u201cAh, what have you done to me, and why?\u201d And at the sight the old man turned angrily away.\n\n\nAnother five days passed, and then the young Prince Nicholas Andr\u00e9evich was baptized. The wet nurse supported the coverlet with her chin, while the priest with a goose feather anointed the boy\u2019s little red and wrinkled soles and palms.\n\nHis grandfather, who was his godfather, trembling and afraid of dropping him, carried the infant round the battered tin font and handed him over to the godmother, Princess Mary. Prince Andrew sat in another room, faint with fear lest the baby should be drowned in the font, and awaited the termination of the ceremony. He looked up joyfully at the baby when the nurse brought it to him and nodded approval when she told him that the wax with the baby\u2019s hair had not sunk in the font but had floated.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nRost\u00f3v\u2019s share in D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s duel with Bez\u00fakhov was hushed up by the efforts of the old count, and instead of being degraded to the ranks as he expected he was appointed an adjutant to the governor general of Moscow. As a result he could not go to the country with the rest of the family, but was kept all summer in Moscow by his new duties. D\u00f3lokhov recovered, and Rost\u00f3v became very friendly with him during his convalescence. D\u00f3lokhov lay ill at his mother\u2019s who loved him passionately and tenderly, and old Mary Iv\u00e1novna, who had grown fond of Rost\u00f3v for his friendship to her F\u00e9dya, often talked to him about her son.\n\n\u201cYes, Count,\u201d she would say, \u201che is too noble and pure-souled for our present, depraved world. No one now loves virtue; it seems like a reproach to everyone. Now tell me, Count, was it right, was it honorable, of Bez\u00fakhov? And F\u00e9dya, with his noble spirit, loved him and even now never says a word against him. Those pranks in Petersburg when they played some tricks on a policeman, didn\u2019t they do it together? And there! Bez\u00fakhov got off scotfree, while F\u00e9dya had to bear the whole burden on his shoulders. Fancy what he had to go through! It\u2019s true he has been reinstated, but how could they fail to do that? I think there were not many such gallant sons of the fatherland out there as he. And now\u2014this duel! Have these people no feeling, or honor? Knowing him to be an only son, to challenge him and shoot so straight! It\u2019s well God had mercy on us. And what was it for? Who doesn\u2019t have intrigues nowadays? Why, if he was so jealous, as I see things he should have shown it sooner, but he lets it go on for months. And then to call him out, reckoning on F\u00e9dya not fighting because he owed him money! What baseness! What meanness! I know you understand F\u00e9dya, my dear count; that, believe me, is why I am so fond of you. Few people do understand him. He is such a lofty, heavenly soul!\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov himself during his convalescence spoke to Rost\u00f3v in a way no one would have expected of him.\n\n\u201cI know people consider me a bad man!\u201d he said. \u201cLet them! I don\u2019t care a straw about anyone but those I love; but those I love, I love so that I would give my life for them, and the others I\u2019d throttle if they stood in my way. I have an adored, a priceless mother, and two or three friends\u2014you among them\u2014and as for the rest I only care about them in so far as they are harmful or useful. And most of them are harmful, especially the women. Yes, dear boy,\u201d he continued, \u201cI have met loving, noble, high-minded men, but I have not yet met any women\u2014countesses or cooks\u2014who were not venal. I have not yet met that divine purity and devotion I look for in women. If I found such a one I\u2019d give my life for her! But those!...\u201d and he made a gesture of contempt. \u201cAnd believe me, if I still value my life it is only because I still hope to meet such a divine creature, who will regenerate, purify, and elevate me. But you don\u2019t understand it.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, I quite understand,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v, who was under his new friend\u2019s influence.\n\nIn the autumn the Rost\u00f3vs returned to Moscow. Early in the winter Den\u00edsov also came back and stayed with them. The first half of the winter of 1806, which Nicholas Rost\u00f3v spent in Moscow, was one of the happiest, merriest times for him and the whole family. Nicholas brought many young men to his parents\u2019 house. V\u00e9ra was a handsome girl of twenty; S\u00f3nya a girl of sixteen with all the charm of an opening flower; Nat\u00e1sha, half grown up and half child, was now childishly amusing, now girlishly enchanting.\n\nAt that time in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house there prevailed an amorous atmosphere characteristic of homes where there are very young and very charming girls. Every young man who came to the house\u2014seeing those impressionable, smiling young faces (smiling probably at their own happiness), feeling the eager bustle around him, and hearing the fitful bursts of song and music and the inconsequent but friendly prattle of young girls ready for anything and full of hope\u2014experienced the same feeling; sharing with the young folk of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 household a readiness to fall in love and an expectation of happiness.\n\nAmong the young men introduced by Rost\u00f3v one of the first was D\u00f3lokhov, whom everyone in the house liked except Nat\u00e1sha. She almost quarreled with her brother about him. She insisted that he was a bad man, and that in the duel with Bez\u00fakhov, Pierre was right and D\u00f3lokhov wrong, and further that he was disagreeable and unnatural.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing for me to understand,\u201d she cried out with resolute self-will, \u201che is wicked and heartless. There now, I like your Den\u00edsov though he is a rake and all that, still I like him; so you see I do understand. I don\u2019t know how to put it... with this one everything is calculated, and I don\u2019t like that. But Den\u00edsov...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Den\u00edsov is quite different,\u201d replied Nicholas, implying that even Den\u00edsov was nothing compared to D\u00f3lokhov\u2014\u201cyou must understand what a soul there is in D\u00f3lokhov, you should see him with his mother. What a heart!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t know about that, but I am uncomfortable with him. And do you know he has fallen in love with S\u00f3nya?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat nonsense...\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m certain of it; you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s prediction proved true. D\u00f3lokhov, who did not usually care for the society of ladies, began to come often to the house, and the question for whose sake he came (though no one spoke of it) was soon settled. He came because of S\u00f3nya. And S\u00f3nya, though she would never have dared to say so, knew it and blushed scarlet every time D\u00f3lokhov appeared.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov often dined at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, never missed a performance at which they were present, and went to Iogel\u2019s balls for young people which the Rost\u00f3vs always attended. He was pointedly attentive to S\u00f3nya and looked at her in such a way that not only could she not bear his glances without coloring, but even the old countess and Nat\u00e1sha blushed when they saw his looks.\n\nIt was evident that this strange, strong man was under the irresistible influence of the dark, graceful girl who loved another.\n\nRost\u00f3v noticed something new in D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s relations with S\u00f3nya, but he did not explain to himself what these new relations were. \u201cThey\u2019re always in love with someone,\u201d he thought of S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha. But he was not as much at ease with S\u00f3nya and D\u00f3lokhov as before and was less frequently at home.\n\nIn the autumn of 1806 everybody had again begun talking of the war with Napoleon with even greater warmth than the year before. Orders were given to raise recruits, ten men in every thousand for the regular army, and besides this, nine men in every thousand for the militia. Everywhere Bonaparte was anathematized and in Moscow nothing but the coming war was talked of. For the Rost\u00f3v family the whole interest of these preparations for war lay in the fact that Nicholas would not hear of remaining in Moscow, and only awaited the termination of Den\u00edsov\u2019s furlough after Christmas to return with him to their regiment. His approaching departure did not prevent his amusing himself, but rather gave zest to his pleasures. He spent the greater part of his time away from home, at dinners, parties, and balls.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nOn the third day after Christmas Nicholas dined at home, a thing he had rarely done of late. It was a grand farewell dinner, as he and Den\u00edsov were leaving to join their regiment after Epiphany. About twenty people were present, including D\u00f3lokhov and Den\u00edsov.\n\nNever had love been so much in the air, and never had the amorous atmosphere made itself so strongly felt in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house as at this holiday time. \u201cSeize the moments of happiness, love and be loved! That is the only reality in the world, all else is folly. It is the one thing we are interested in here,\u201d said the spirit of the place.\n\nNicholas, having as usual exhausted two pairs of horses, without visiting all the places he meant to go to and where he had been invited, returned home just before dinner. As soon as he entered he noticed and felt the tension of the amorous air in the house, and also noticed a curious embarrassment among some of those present. S\u00f3nya, D\u00f3lokhov, and the old countess were especially disturbed, and to a lesser degree Nat\u00e1sha. Nicholas understood that something must have happened between S\u00f3nya and D\u00f3lokhov before dinner, and with the kindly sensitiveness natural to him was very gentle and wary with them both at dinner. On that same evening there was to be one of the balls that Iogel (the dancing master) gave for his pupils during the holidays.\n\n\u201cNicholas, will you come to Iogel\u2019s? Please do!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cHe asked you, and Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich is also going.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere would I not go at the countess\u2019 command!\u201d said Den\u00edsov, who at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 had jocularly assumed the role of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s knight. \u201cI\u2019m even weady to dance the pas de ch\u00e2le.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I have time,\u201d answered Nicholas. \u201cBut I promised the Arkh\u00e1rovs; they have a party.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you?\u201d he asked D\u00f3lokhov, but as soon as he had asked the question he noticed that it should not have been put.\n\n\u201cPerhaps,\u201d coldly and angrily replied D\u00f3lokhov, glancing at S\u00f3nya, and, scowling, he gave Nicholas just such a look as he had given Pierre at the club dinner.\n\n\u201cThere is something up,\u201d thought Nicholas, and he was further confirmed in this conclusion by the fact that D\u00f3lokhov left immediately after dinner. He called Nat\u00e1sha and asked her what was the matter.\n\n\u201cAnd I was looking for you,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha running out to him. \u201cI told you, but you would not believe it,\u201d she said triumphantly. \u201cHe has proposed to S\u00f3nya!\u201d\n\nLittle as Nicholas had occupied himself with S\u00f3nya of late, something seemed to give way within him at this news. D\u00f3lokhov was a suitable and in some respects a brilliant match for the dowerless, orphan girl. From the point of view of the old countess and of society it was out of the question for her to refuse him. And therefore Nicholas\u2019 first feeling on hearing the news was one of anger with S\u00f3nya.... He tried to say, \u201cThat\u2019s capital; of course she\u2019ll forget her childish promises and accept the offer,\u201d but before he had time to say it Nat\u00e1sha began again.\n\n\u201cAnd fancy! she refused him quite definitely!\u201d adding, after a pause, \u201cshe told him she loved another.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, my S\u00f3nya could not have done otherwise!\u201d thought Nicholas.\n\n\u201cMuch as Mamma pressed her, she refused, and I know she won\u2019t change once she has said...\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Mamma pressed her!\u201d said Nicholas reproachfully.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you know, Nicholas\u2014don\u2019t be angry\u2014but I know you will not marry her. I know, heaven knows how, but I know for certain that you won\u2019t marry her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow you don\u2019t know that at all!\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cBut I must talk to her. What a darling S\u00f3nya is!\u201d he added with a smile.\n\n\u201cAh, she is indeed a darling! I\u2019ll send her to you.\u201d\n\nAnd Nat\u00e1sha kissed her brother and ran away.\n\nA minute later S\u00f3nya came in with a frightened, guilty, and scared look. Nicholas went up to her and kissed her hand. This was the first time since his return that they had talked alone and about their love.\n\n\u201cSophie,\u201d he began, timidly at first and then more and more boldly, \u201cif you wish to refuse one who is not only a brilliant and advantageous match but a splendid, noble fellow... he is my friend...\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya interrupted him.\n\n\u201cI have already refused,\u201d she said hurriedly.\n\n\u201cIf you are refusing for my sake, I am afraid that I...\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya again interrupted. She gave him an imploring, frightened look.\n\n\u201cNicholas, don\u2019t tell me that!\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cNo, but I must. It may be arrogant of me, but still it is best to say it. If you refuse him on my account, I must tell you the whole truth. I love you, and I think I love you more than anyone else....\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is enough for me,\u201d said S\u00f3nya, blushing.\n\n\u201cNo, but I have been in love a thousand times and shall fall in love again, though for no one have I such a feeling of friendship, confidence, and love as I have for you. Then I am young. Mamma does not wish it. In a word, I make no promise. And I beg you to consider D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s offer,\u201d he said, articulating his friend\u2019s name with difficulty.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say that to me! I want nothing. I love you as a brother and always shall, and I want nothing more.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are an angel: I am not worthy of you, but I am afraid of misleading you.\u201d\n\nAnd Nicholas again kissed her hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIogel\u2019s were the most enjoyable balls in Moscow. So said the mothers as they watched their young people executing their newly learned steps, and so said the youths and maidens themselves as they danced till they were ready to drop, and so said the grown-up young men and women who came to these balls with an air of condescension and found them most enjoyable. That year two marriages had come of these balls. The two pretty young Princesses Gorchak\u00f3v met suitors there and were married and so further increased the fame of these dances. What distinguished them from others was the absence of host or hostess and the presence of the good-natured Iogel, flying about like a feather and bowing according to the rules of his art, as he collected the tickets from all his visitors. There was the fact that only those came who wished to dance and amuse themselves as girls of thirteen and fourteen do who are wearing long dresses for the first time. With scarcely any exceptions they all were, or seemed to be, pretty\u2014so rapturous were their smiles and so sparkling their eyes. Sometimes the best of the pupils, of whom Nat\u00e1sha, who was exceptionally graceful, was first, even danced the pas de ch\u00e2le, but at this last ball only the \u00e9cossaise, the anglaise, and the mazurka, which was just coming into fashion, were danced. Iogel had taken a ballroom in Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s house, and the ball, as everyone said, was a great success. There were many pretty girls and the Rost\u00f3v girls were among the prettiest. They were both particularly happy and gay. That evening, proud of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s proposal, her refusal, and her explanation with Nicholas, S\u00f3nya twirled about before she left home so that the maid could hardly get her hair plaited, and she was transparently radiant with impulsive joy.\n\nNat\u00e1sha no less proud of her first long dress and of being at a real ball was even happier. They were both dressed in white muslin with pink ribbons.\n\nNat\u00e1sha fell in love the very moment she entered the ballroom. She was not in love with anyone in particular, but with everyone. Whatever person she happened to look at she was in love with for that moment.\n\n\u201cOh, how delightful it is!\u201d she kept saying, running up to S\u00f3nya.\n\nNicholas and Den\u00edsov were walking up and down, looking with kindly patronage at the dancers.\n\n\u201cHow sweet she is\u2014she will be a weal beauty!\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cCountess Nat\u00e1sha,\u201d answered Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cAnd how she dances! What gwace!\u201d he said again after a pause.\n\n\u201cWho are you talking about?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout your sister,\u201d ejaculated Den\u00edsov testily.\n\nRost\u00f3v smiled.\n\n\u201cMy dear count, you were one of my best pupils\u2014you must dance,\u201d said little Iogel coming up to Nicholas. \u201cLook how many charming young ladies\u2014\u201d He turned with the same request to Den\u00edsov who was also a former pupil of his.\n\n\u201cNo, my dear fellow, I\u2019ll be a wallflower,\u201d said Den\u00edsov. \u201cDon\u2019t you wecollect what bad use I made of your lessons?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d said Iogel, hastening to reassure him. \u201cYou were only inattentive, but you had talent\u2014oh yes, you had talent!\u201d\n\nThe band struck up the newly introduced mazurka. Nicholas could not refuse Iogel and asked S\u00f3nya to dance. Den\u00edsov sat down by the old ladies and, leaning on his saber and beating time with his foot, told them something funny and kept them amused, while he watched the young people dancing, Iogel with Nat\u00e1sha, his pride and his best pupil, were the first couple. Noiselessly, skillfully stepping with his little feet in low shoes, Iogel flew first across the hall with Nat\u00e1sha, who, though shy, went on carefully executing her steps. Den\u00edsov did not take his eyes off her and beat time with his saber in a way that clearly indicated that if he was not dancing it was because he would not and not because he could not. In the middle of a figure he beckoned to Rost\u00f3v who was passing:\n\n\u201cThis is not at all the thing,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat sort of Polish mazuwka is this? But she does dance splendidly.\u201d\n\nKnowing that Den\u00edsov had a reputation even in Poland for the masterly way in which he danced the mazurka, Nicholas ran up to Nat\u00e1sha:\n\n\u201cGo and choose Den\u00edsov. He is a real dancer, a wonder!\u201d he said.\n\nWhen it came to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s turn to choose a partner, she rose and, tripping rapidly across in her little shoes trimmed with bows, ran timidly to the corner where Den\u00edsov sat. She saw that everybody was looking at her and waiting. Nicholas saw that Den\u00edsov was refusing though he smiled delightedly. He ran up to them.\n\n\u201cPlease, Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha was saying, \u201cdo come!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, let me off, Countess,\u201d Den\u00edsov replied.\n\n\u201cNow then, V\u00e1ska,\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cThey coax me as if I were V\u00e1ska the cat!\u201d said Den\u00edsov jokingly.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll sing for you a whole evening,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cOh, the faiwy! She can do anything with me!\u201d said Den\u00edsov, and he unhooked his saber. He came out from behind the chairs, clasped his partner\u2019s hand firmly, threw back his head, and advanced his foot, waiting for the beat. Only on horse back and in the mazurka was Den\u00edsov\u2019s short stature not noticeable and he looked the fine fellow he felt himself to be. At the right beat of the music he looked sideways at his partner with a merry and triumphant air, suddenly stamped with one foot, bounded from the floor like a ball, and flew round the room taking his partner with him. He glided silently on one foot half across the room, and seeming not to notice the chairs was dashing straight at them, when suddenly, clinking his spurs and spreading out his legs, he stopped short on his heels, stood so a second, stamped on the spot clanking his spurs, whirled rapidly round, and, striking his left heel against his right, flew round again in a circle. Nat\u00e1sha guessed what he meant to do, and abandoning herself to him followed his lead hardly knowing how. First he spun her round, holding her now with his left, now with his right hand, then falling on one knee he twirled her round him, and again jumping up, dashed so impetuously forward that it seemed as if he would rush through the whole suite of rooms without drawing breath, and then he suddenly stopped and performed some new and unexpected steps. When at last, smartly whirling his partner round in front of her chair, he drew up with a click of his spurs and bowed to her, Nat\u00e1sha did not even make him a curtsy. She fixed her eyes on him in amazement, smiling as if she did not recognize him.\n\n\u201cWhat does this mean?\u201d she brought out.\n\nAlthough Iogel did not acknowledge this to be the real mazurka, everyone was delighted with Den\u00edsov\u2019s skill, he was asked again and again as a partner, and the old men began smilingly to talk about Poland and the good old days. Den\u00edsov, flushed after the mazurka and mopping himself with his handkerchief, sat down by Nat\u00e1sha and did not leave her for the rest of the evening.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nFor two days after that Rost\u00f3v did not see D\u00f3lokhov at his own or at D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s home: on the third day he received a note from him:\n\nAs I do not intend to be at your house again for reasons you know of, and am going to rejoin my regiment, I am giving a farewell supper tonight to my friends\u2014come to the English Hotel.\n\nAbout ten o\u2019clock Rost\u00f3v went to the English Hotel straight from the theater, where he had been with his family and Den\u00edsov. He was at once shown to the best room, which D\u00f3lokhov had taken for that evening. Some twenty men were gathered round a table at which D\u00f3lokhov sat between two candles. On the table was a pile of gold and paper money, and he was keeping the bank. Rost\u00f3v had not seen him since his proposal and S\u00f3nya\u2019s refusal and felt uncomfortable at the thought of how they would meet.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov\u2019s clear, cold glance met Rost\u00f3v as soon as he entered the door, as though he had long expected him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a long time since we met,\u201d he said. \u201cThanks for coming. I\u2019ll just finish dealing, and then Ily\u00fashka will come with his chorus.\u201d\n\n\u201cI called once or twice at your house,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, reddening.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov made no reply.\n\n\u201cYou may punt,\u201d he said.\n\nRost\u00f3v recalled at that moment a strange conversation he had once had with D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cNone but fools trust to luck in play,\u201d D\u00f3lokhov had then said.\n\n\u201cOr are you afraid to play with me?\u201d D\u00f3lokhov now asked as if guessing Rost\u00f3v\u2019s thought.\n\nBeneath his smile Rost\u00f3v saw in him the mood he had shown at the club dinner and at other times, when as if tired of everyday life he had felt a need to escape from it by some strange, and usually cruel, action.\n\nRost\u00f3v felt ill at ease. He tried, but failed, to find some joke with which to reply to D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s words. But before he had thought of anything, D\u00f3lokhov, looking straight in his face, said slowly and deliberately so that everyone could hear:\n\n\u201cDo you remember we had a talk about cards... \u2018He\u2019s a fool who trusts to luck, one should make certain,\u2019 and I want to try.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo try his luck or the certainty?\u201d Rost\u00f3v asked himself.\n\n\u201cWell, you\u2019d better not play,\u201d D\u00f3lokhov added, and springing a new pack of cards said: \u201cBank, gentlemen!\u201d\n\nMoving the money forward he prepared to deal. Rost\u00f3v sat down by his side and at first did not play. D\u00f3lokhov kept glancing at him.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you play?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd strange to say Nicholas felt that he could not help taking up a card, putting a small stake on it, and beginning to play.\n\n\u201cI have no money with me,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll trust you.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v staked five rubles on a card and lost, staked again, and again lost. D\u00f3lokhov \u201ckilled,\u201d that is, beat, ten cards of Rost\u00f3v\u2019s running.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov after he had dealt for some time. \u201cPlease place your money on the cards or I may get muddled in the reckoning.\u201d\n\nOne of the players said he hoped he might be trusted.\n\n\u201cYes, you might, but I am afraid of getting the accounts mixed. So I ask you to put the money on your cards,\u201d replied D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cDon\u2019t stint yourself, we\u2019ll settle afterwards,\u201d he added, turning to Rost\u00f3v.\n\nThe game continued; a waiter kept handing round champagne.\n\nAll Rost\u00f3v\u2019s cards were beaten and he had eight hundred rubles scored up against him. He wrote \u201c800 rubles\u201d on a card, but while the waiter filled his glass he changed his mind and altered it to his usual stake of twenty rubles.\n\n\u201cLeave it,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, though he did not seem to be even looking at Rost\u00f3v, \u201cyou\u2019ll win it back all the sooner. I lose to the others but win from you. Or are you afraid of me?\u201d he asked again.\n\nRost\u00f3v submitted. He let the eight hundred remain and laid down a seven of hearts with a torn corner, which he had picked up from the floor. He well remembered that seven afterwards. He laid down the seven of hearts, on which with a broken bit of chalk he had written \u201c800 rubles\u201d in clear upright figures; he emptied the glass of warm champagne that was handed him, smiled at D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s words, and with a sinking heart, waiting for a seven to turn up, gazed at D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hands which held the pack. Much depended on Rost\u00f3v\u2019s winning or losing on that seven of hearts. On the previous Sunday the old count had given his son two thousand rubles, and though he always disliked speaking of money difficulties had told Nicholas that this was all he could let him have till May, and asked him to be more economical this time. Nicholas had replied that it would be more than enough for him and that he gave his word of honor not to take anything more till the spring. Now only twelve hundred rubles was left of that money, so that this seven of hearts meant for him not only the loss of sixteen hundred rubles, but the necessity of going back on his word. With a sinking heart he watched D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hands and thought, \u201cNow then, make haste and let me have this card and I\u2019ll take my cap and drive home to supper with Den\u00edsov, Nat\u00e1sha, and S\u00f3nya, and will certainly never touch a card again.\u201d At that moment his home life, jokes with P\u00e9tya, talks with S\u00f3nya, duets with Nat\u00e1sha, piquet with his father, and even his comfortable bed in the house on the Povarsk\u00e1ya rose before him with such vividness, clearness, and charm that it seemed as if it were all a lost and unappreciated bliss, long past. He could not conceive that a stupid chance, letting the seven be dealt to the right rather than to the left, might deprive him of all this happiness, newly appreciated and newly illumined, and plunge him into the depths of unknown and undefined misery. That could not be, yet he awaited with a sinking heart the movement of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hands. Those broad, reddish hands, with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt cuffs, laid down the pack and took up a glass and a pipe that were handed him.\n\n\u201cSo you are not afraid to play with me?\u201d repeated D\u00f3lokhov, and as if about to tell a good story he put down the cards, leaned back in his chair, and began deliberately with a smile:\n\n\u201cYes, gentlemen, I\u2019ve been told there\u2019s a rumor going about Moscow that I\u2019m a sharper, so I advise you to be careful.\u201d\n\n\u201cCome now, deal!\u201d exclaimed Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cOh, those Moscow gossips!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, and he took up the cards with a smile.\n\n\u201cAah!\u201d Rost\u00f3v almost screamed lifting both hands to his head. The seven he needed was lying uppermost, the first card in the pack. He had lost more than he could pay.\n\n\u201cStill, don\u2019t ruin yourself!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov with a side glance at Rost\u00f3v as he continued to deal.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nAn hour and a half later most of the players were but little interested in their own play.\n\nThe whole interest was concentrated on Rost\u00f3v. Instead of sixteen hundred rubles he had a long column of figures scored against him, which he had reckoned up to ten thousand, but that now, as he vaguely supposed, must have risen to fifteen thousand. In reality it already exceeded twenty thousand rubles. D\u00f3lokhov was no longer listening to stories or telling them, but followed every movement of Rost\u00f3v\u2019s hands and occasionally ran his eyes over the score against him. He had decided to play until that score reached forty-three thousand. He had fixed on that number because forty-three was the sum of his and S\u00f3nya\u2019s joint ages. Rost\u00f3v, leaning his head on both hands, sat at the table which was scrawled over with figures, wet with spilled wine, and littered with cards. One tormenting impression did not leave him: that those broad-boned reddish hands with hairy wrists visible from under the shirt sleeves, those hands which he loved and hated, held him in their power.\n\n\u201cSix hundred rubles, ace, a corner, a nine... winning it back\u2019s impossible... Oh, how pleasant it was at home!... The knave, double or quits... it can\u2019t be!... And why is he doing this to me?\u201d Rost\u00f3v pondered. Sometimes he staked a large sum, but D\u00f3lokhov refused to accept it and fixed the stake himself. Nicholas submitted to him, and at one moment prayed to God as he had done on the battlefield at the bridge over the Enns, and then guessed that the card that came first to hand from the crumpled heap under the table would save him, now counted the cords on his coat and took a card with that number and tried staking the total of his losses on it, then he looked round for aid from the other players, or peered at the now cold face of D\u00f3lokhov and tried to read what was passing in his mind.\n\n\u201cHe knows of course what this loss means to me. He can\u2019t want my ruin. Wasn\u2019t he my friend? Wasn\u2019t I fond of him? But it\u2019s not his fault. What\u2019s he to do if he has such luck?... And it\u2019s not my fault either,\u201d he thought to himself, \u201cI have done nothing wrong. Have I killed anyone, or insulted or wished harm to anyone? Why such a terrible misfortune? And when did it begin? Such a little while ago I came to this table with the thought of winning a hundred rubles to buy that casket for Mamma\u2019s name day and then going home. I was so happy, so free, so lighthearted! And I did not realize how happy I was! When did that end and when did this new, terrible state of things begin? What marked the change? I sat all the time in this same place at this table, chose and placed cards, and watched those broad-boned agile hands in the same way. When did it happen and what has happened? I am well and strong and still the same and in the same place. No, it can\u2019t be! Surely it will all end in nothing!\u201d\n\nHe was flushed and bathed in perspiration, though the room was not hot. His face was terrible and piteous to see, especially from its helpless efforts to seem calm.\n\nThe score against him reached the fateful sum of forty-three thousand. Rost\u00f3v had just prepared a card, by bending the corner of which he meant to double the three thousand just put down to his score, when D\u00f3lokhov, slamming down the pack of cards, put it aside and began rapidly adding up the total of Rost\u00f3v\u2019s debt, breaking the chalk as he marked the figures in his clear, bold hand.\n\n\u201cSupper, it\u2019s time for supper! And here are the gypsies!\u201d\n\nSome swarthy men and women were really entering from the cold outside and saying something in their gypsy accents. Nicholas understood that it was all over; but he said in an indifferent tone:\n\n\u201cWell, won\u2019t you go on? I had a splendid card all ready,\u201d as if it were the fun of the game which interested him most.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all up! I\u2019m lost!\u201d thought he. \u201cNow a bullet through my brain\u2014that\u2019s all that\u2019s left me!\u201d And at the same time he said in a cheerful voice:\n\n\u201cCome now, just this one more little card!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, having finished the addition. \u201cAll right! Twenty-one rubles,\u201d he said, pointing to the figure twenty-one by which the total exceeded the round sum of forty-three thousand; and taking up a pack he prepared to deal. Rost\u00f3v submissively unbent the corner of his card and, instead of the six thousand he had intended, carefully wrote twenty-one.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI only want to see whether you will let me win this ten, or beat it.\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov began to deal seriously. Oh, how Rost\u00f3v detested at that moment those hands with their short reddish fingers and hairy wrists, which held him in their power.... The ten fell to him.\n\n\u201cYou owe forty-three thousand, Count,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, and stretching himself he rose from the table. \u201cOne does get tired sitting so long,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019m tired too,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov cut him short, as if to remind him that it was not for him to jest.\n\n\u201cWhen am I to receive the money, Count?\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, flushing, drew D\u00f3lokhov into the next room.\n\n\u201cI cannot pay it all immediately. Will you take an I.O.U.?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI say, Rost\u00f3v,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov clearly, smiling and looking Nicholas straight in the eyes, \u201cyou know the saying, \u2018Lucky in love, unlucky at cards.\u2019 Your cousin is in love with you, I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s terrible to feel oneself so in this man\u2019s power,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. He knew what a shock he would inflict on his father and mother by the news of this loss, he knew what a relief it would be to escape it all, and felt that D\u00f3lokhov knew that he could save him from all this shame and sorrow, but wanted now to play with him as a cat does with a mouse.\n\n\u201cYour cousin...\u201d D\u00f3lokhov started to say, but Nicholas interrupted him.\n\n\u201cMy cousin has nothing to do with this and it\u2019s not necessary to mention her!\u201d he exclaimed fiercely.\n\n\u201cThen when am I to have it?\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow,\u201d replied Rost\u00f3v and left the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nTo say \u201ctomorrow\u201d and keep up a dignified tone was not difficult, but to go home alone, see his sisters, brother, mother, and father, confess and ask for money he had no right to after giving his word of honor, was terrible.\n\nAt home, they had not yet gone to bed. The young people, after returning from the theater, had had supper and were grouped round the clavichord. As soon as Nicholas entered, he was enfolded in that poetic atmosphere of love which pervaded the Rost\u00f3v household that winter and, now after D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s proposal and Iogel\u2019s ball, seemed to have grown thicker round S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha as the air does before a thunderstorm. S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha, in the light-blue dresses they had worn at the theater, looking pretty and conscious of it, were standing by the clavichord, happy and smiling. V\u00e9ra was playing chess with Shinsh\u00edn in the drawing room. The old countess, waiting for the return of her husband and son, sat playing patience with the old gentlewoman who lived in their house. Den\u00edsov, with sparkling eyes and ruffled hair, sat at the clavichord striking chords with his short fingers, his legs thrown back and his eyes rolling as he sang, with his small, husky, but true voice, some verses called \u201cEnchantress,\u201d which he had composed, and to which he was trying to fit music:\n\n\nEnchantress, say, to my forsaken lyre\nWhat magic power is this recalls me still?\nWhat spark has set my inmost soul on fire,\nWhat is this bliss that makes my fingers thrill?\n\n\nHe was singing in passionate tones, gazing with his sparkling black-agate eyes at the frightened and happy Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cSplendid! Excellent!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cAnother verse,\u201d she said, without noticing Nicholas.\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s still the same with them,\u201d thought Nicholas, glancing into the drawing room, where he saw V\u00e9ra and his mother with the old lady.\n\n\u201cAh, and here\u2019s Nicholas!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, running up to him.\n\n\u201cIs Papa at home?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI am so glad you\u2019ve come!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, without answering him. \u201cWe are enjoying ourselves! Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich is staying a day longer for my sake! Did you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Papa is not back yet,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cNicholas, have you come? Come here, dear!\u201d called the old countess from the drawing room.\n\nNicholas went to her, kissed her hand, and sitting down silently at her table began to watch her hands arranging the cards. From the dancing room, they still heard the laughter and merry voices trying to persuade Nat\u00e1sha to sing.\n\n\u201cAll wight! All wight!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov. \u201cIt\u2019s no good making excuses now! It\u2019s your turn to sing the ba\u2019cawolla\u2014I entweat you!\u201d\n\nThe countess glanced at her silent son.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOh, nothing,\u201d said he, as if weary of being continually asked the same question. \u201cWill Papa be back soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect so.\u201d\n\n\u201cEverything\u2019s the same with them. They know nothing about it! Where am I to go?\u201d thought Nicholas, and went again into the dancing room where the clavichord stood.\n\nS\u00f3nya was sitting at the clavichord, playing the prelude to Den\u00edsov\u2019s favorite barcarolle. Nat\u00e1sha was preparing to sing. Den\u00edsov was looking at her with enraptured eyes.\n\nNicholas began pacing up and down the room.\n\n\u201cWhy do they want to make her sing? How can she sing? There\u2019s nothing to be happy about!\u201d thought he.\n\nS\u00f3nya struck the first chord of the prelude.\n\n\u201cMy God, I\u2019m a ruined and dishonored man! A bullet through my brain is the only thing left me\u2014not singing!\u201d his thoughts ran on. \u201cGo away? But where to? It\u2019s one\u2014let them sing!\u201d\n\nHe continued to pace the room, looking gloomily at Den\u00edsov and the girls and avoiding their eyes.\n\n\u201cNik\u00f3lenka, what is the matter?\u201d S\u00f3nya\u2019s eyes fixed on him seemed to ask. She noticed at once that something had happened to him.\n\nNicholas turned away from her. Nat\u00e1sha too, with her quick instinct, had instantly noticed her brother\u2019s condition. But, though she noticed it, she was herself in such high spirits at that moment, so far from sorrow, sadness, or self-reproach, that she purposely deceived herself as young people often do. \u201cNo, I am too happy now to spoil my enjoyment by sympathy with anyone\u2019s sorrow,\u201d she felt, and she said to herself: \u201cNo, I must be mistaken, he must be feeling happy, just as I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, S\u00f3nya!\u201d she said, going to the very middle of the room, where she considered the resonance was best.\n\nHaving lifted her head and let her arms droop lifelessly, as ballet dancers do, Nat\u00e1sha, rising energetically from her heels to her toes, stepped to the middle of the room and stood still.\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s me!\u201d she seemed to say, answering the rapt gaze with which Den\u00edsov followed her.\n\n\u201cAnd what is she so pleased about?\u201d thought Nicholas, looking at his sister. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t she dull and ashamed?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha took the first note, her throat swelled, her chest rose, her eyes became serious. At that moment she was oblivious of her surroundings, and from her smiling lips flowed sounds which anyone may produce at the same intervals and hold for the same time, but which leave you cold a thousand times and the thousand and first time thrill you and make you weep.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, that winter, had for the first time begun to sing seriously, mainly because Den\u00edsov so delighted in her singing. She no longer sang as a child, there was no longer in her singing that comical, childish, painstaking effect that had been in it before; but she did not yet sing well, as all the connoisseurs who heard her said: \u201cIt is not trained, but it is a beautiful voice that must be trained.\u201d Only they generally said this some time after she had finished singing. While that untrained voice, with its incorrect breathing and labored transitions, was sounding, even the connoisseurs said nothing, but only delighted in it and wished to hear it again. In her voice there was a virginal freshness, an unconsciousness of her own powers, and an as yet untrained velvety softness, which so mingled with her lack of art in singing that it seemed as if nothing in that voice could be altered without spoiling it.\n\n\u201cWhat is this?\u201d thought Nicholas, listening to her with widely opened eyes. \u201cWhat has happened to her? How she is singing today!\u201d And suddenly the whole world centered for him on anticipation of the next note, the next phrase, and everything in the world was divided into three beats: \u201cOh mio crudele affetto.\u201d... One, two, three... one, two, three... One... \u201cOh mio crudele affetto.\u201d... One, two, three... One. \u201cOh, this senseless life of ours!\u201d thought Nicholas. \u201cAll this misery, and money, and D\u00f3lokhov, and anger, and honor\u2014it\u2019s all nonsense... but this is real.... Now then, Nat\u00e1sha, now then, dearest! Now then, darling! How will she take that si? She\u2019s taken it! Thank God!\u201d And without noticing that he was singing, to strengthen the si he sung a second, a third below the high note. \u201cAh, God! How fine! Did I really take it? How fortunate!\u201d he thought.\n\nOh, how that chord vibrated, and how moved was something that was finest in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s soul! And this something was apart from everything else in the world and above everything in the world. \u201cWhat were losses, and D\u00f3lokhov, and words of honor?... All nonsense! One might kill and rob and yet be happy....\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIt was long since Rost\u00f3v had felt such enjoyment from music as he did that day. But no sooner had Nat\u00e1sha finished her barcarolle than reality again presented itself. He got up without saying a word and went downstairs to his own room. A quarter of an hour later the old count came in from his club, cheerful and contented. Nicholas, hearing him drive up, went to meet him.\n\n\u201cWell\u2014had a good time?\u201d said the old count, smiling gaily and proudly at his son.\n\nNicholas tried to say \u201cYes,\u201d but could not: and he nearly burst into sobs. The count was lighting his pipe and did not notice his son\u2019s condition.\n\n\u201cAh, it can\u2019t be avoided!\u201d thought Nicholas, for the first and last time. And suddenly, in the most casual tone, which made him feel ashamed of himself, he said, as if merely asking his father to let him have the carriage to drive to town:\n\n\u201cPapa, I have come on a matter of business. I was nearly forgetting. I need some money.\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me!\u201d said his father, who was in a specially good humor. \u201cI told you it would not be enough. How much?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery much,\u201d said Nicholas flushing, and with a stupid careless smile, for which he was long unable to forgive himself, \u201cI have lost a little, I mean a good deal, a great deal\u2014forty three thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat! To whom?... Nonsense!\u201d cried the count, suddenly reddening with an apoplectic flush over neck and nape as old people do.\n\n\u201cI promised to pay tomorrow,\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWell!...\u201d said the old count, spreading out his arms and sinking helplessly on the sofa.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped! It happens to everyone!\u201d said the son, with a bold, free, and easy tone, while in his soul he regarded himself as a worthless scoundrel whose whole life could not atone for his crime. He longed to kiss his father\u2019s hands and kneel to beg his forgiveness, but said, in a careless and even rude voice, that it happens to everyone!\n\nThe old count cast down his eyes on hearing his son\u2019s words and began bustlingly searching for something.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d he muttered, \u201cit will be difficult, I fear, difficult to raise... happens to everybody! Yes, who has not done it?\u201d\n\nAnd with a furtive glance at his son\u2019s face, the count went out of the room.... Nicholas had been prepared for resistance, but had not at all expected this.\n\n\u201cPapa! Pa-pa!\u201d he called after him, sobbing, \u201cforgive me!\u201d And seizing his father\u2019s hand, he pressed it to his lips and burst into tears.\n\nWhile father and son were having their explanation, the mother and daughter were having one not less important. Nat\u00e1sha came running to her mother, quite excited.\n\n\u201cMamma!... Mamma!... He has made me...\u201d\n\n\u201cMade what?\u201d\n\n\u201cMade, made me an offer, Mamma! Mamma!\u201d she exclaimed.\n\nThe countess did not believe her ears. Den\u00edsov had proposed. To whom? To this chit of a girl, Nat\u00e1sha, who not so long ago was playing with dolls and who was still having lessons.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! What nonsense!\u201d she said, hoping it was a joke.\n\n\u201cNonsense, indeed! I am telling you the fact,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha indignantly. \u201cI come to ask you what to do, and you call it \u2018nonsense!\u2019\u201d\n\nThe countess shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\u201cIf it is true that Monsieur Den\u00edsov has made you a proposal, tell him he is a fool, that\u2019s all!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not a fool!\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha indignantly and seriously.\n\n\u201cWell then, what do you want? You\u2019re all in love nowadays. Well, if you are in love, marry him!\u201d said the countess, with a laugh of annoyance. \u201cGood luck to you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mamma, I\u2019m not in love with him, I suppose I\u2019m not in love with him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, tell him so.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma, are you cross? Don\u2019t be cross, dear! Is it my fault?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but what is it, my dear? Do you want me to go and tell him?\u201d said the countess smiling.\n\n\u201cNo, I will do it myself, only tell me what to say. It\u2019s all very well for you,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, with a responsive smile. \u201cYou should have seen how he said it! I know he did not mean to say it, but it came out accidently.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all the same, you must refuse him.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I mustn\u2019t. I am so sorry for him! He\u2019s so nice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, accept his offer. It\u2019s high time for you to be married,\u201d answered the countess sharply and sarcastically.\n\n\u201cNo, Mamma, but I\u2019m so sorry for him. I don\u2019t know how I\u2019m to say it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd there\u2019s nothing for you to say. I shall speak to him myself,\u201d said the countess, indignant that they should have dared to treat this little Nat\u00e1sha as grown up.\n\n\u201cNo, not on any account! I will tell him myself, and you\u2019ll listen at the door,\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha ran across the drawing room to the dancing hall, where Den\u00edsov was sitting on the same chair by the clavichord with his face in his hands.\n\nHe jumped up at the sound of her light step.\n\n\u201cNataly,\u201d he said, moving with rapid steps toward her, \u201cdecide my fate. It is in your hands.\u201d\n\n\u201cVas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich, I\u2019m so sorry for you!... No, but you are so nice... but it won\u2019t do...not that... but as a friend, I shall always love you.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov bent over her hand and she heard strange sounds she did not understand. She kissed his rough curly black head. At this instant, they heard the quick rustle of the countess\u2019 dress. She came up to them.\n\n\u201cVas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich, I thank you for the honor,\u201d she said, with an embarrassed voice, though it sounded severe to Den\u00edsov\u2014\u201cbut my daughter is so young, and I thought that, as my son\u2019s friend, you would have addressed yourself first to me. In that case you would not have obliged me to give this refusal.\u201d\n\n\u201cCountess...\u201d said Den\u00edsov, with downcast eyes and a guilty face. He tried to say more, but faltered.\n\nNat\u00e1sha could not remain calm, seeing him in such a plight. She began to sob aloud.\n\n\u201cCountess, I have done w\u2019ong,\u201d Den\u00edsov went on in an unsteady voice, \u201cbut believe me, I so adore your daughter and all your family that I would give my life twice over...\u201d He looked at the countess, and seeing her severe face said: \u201cWell, good-by, Countess,\u201d and kissing her hand, he left the room with quick resolute strides, without looking at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\nNext day Rost\u00f3v saw Den\u00edsov off. He did not wish to stay another day in Moscow. All Den\u00edsov\u2019s Moscow friends gave him a farewell entertainment at the gypsies\u2019, with the result that he had no recollection of how he was put in the sleigh or of the first three stages of his journey.\n\nAfter Den\u00edsov\u2019s departure, Rost\u00f3v spent another fortnight in Moscow, without going out of the house, waiting for the money his father could not at once raise, and he spent most of his time in the girls\u2019 room.\n\nS\u00f3nya was more tender and devoted to him than ever. It was as if she wanted to show him that his losses were an achievement that made her love him all the more, but Nicholas now considered himself unworthy of her.\n\nHe filled the girls\u2019 albums with verses and music, and having at last sent D\u00f3lokhov the whole forty-three thousand rubles and received his receipt, he left at the end of November, without taking leave of any of his acquaintances, to overtake his regiment which was already in Poland.\n\n\n\nBOOK FIVE: 1806 - 07\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAfter his interview with his wife Pierre left for Petersburg. At the Torzh\u00f3k post station, either there were no horses or the postmaster would not supply them. Pierre was obliged to wait. Without undressing, he lay down on the leather sofa in front of a round table, put his big feet in their overboots on the table, and began to reflect.\n\n\u201cWill you have the portmanteaus brought in? And a bed got ready, and tea?\u201d asked his valet.\n\nPierre gave no answer, for he neither heard nor saw anything. He had begun to think of the last station and was still pondering on the same question\u2014one so important that he took no notice of what went on around him. Not only was he indifferent as to whether he got to Petersburg earlier or later, or whether he secured accommodation at this station, but compared to the thoughts that now occupied him it was a matter of indifference whether he remained there for a few hours or for the rest of his life.\n\nThe postmaster, his wife, the valet, and a peasant woman selling Torzh\u00f3k embroidery came into the room offering their services. Without changing his careless attitude, Pierre looked at them over his spectacles unable to understand what they wanted or how they could go on living without having solved the problems that so absorbed him. He had been engrossed by the same thoughts ever since the day he returned from Sok\u00f3lniki after the duel and had spent that first agonizing, sleepless night. But now, in the solitude of the journey, they seized him with special force. No matter what he thought about, he always returned to these same questions which he could not solve and yet could not cease to ask himself. It was as if the thread of the chief screw which held his life together were stripped, so that the screw could not get in or out, but went on turning uselessly in the same place.\n\nThe postmaster came in and began obsequiously to beg his excellency to wait only two hours, when, come what might, he would let his excellency have the courier horses. It was plain that he was lying and only wanted to get more money from the traveler.\n\n\u201cIs this good or bad?\u201d Pierre asked himself. \u201cIt is good for me, bad for another traveler, and for himself it\u2019s unavoidable, because he needs money for food; the man said an officer had once given him a thrashing for letting a private traveler have the courier horses. But the officer thrashed him because he had to get on as quickly as possible. And I,\u201d continued Pierre, \u201cshot D\u00f3lokhov because I considered myself injured, and Louis XVI was executed because they considered him a criminal, and a year later they executed those who executed him\u2014also for some reason. What is bad? What is good? What should one love and what hate? What does one live for? And what am I? What is life, and what is death? What power governs all?\u201d\n\nThere was no answer to any of these questions, except one, and that not a logical answer and not at all a reply to them. The answer was: \u201cYou\u2019ll die and all will end. You\u2019ll die and know all, or cease asking.\u201d But dying was also dreadful.\n\nThe Torzh\u00f3k peddler woman, in a whining voice, went on offering her wares, especially a pair of goatskin slippers. \u201cI have hundreds of rubles I don\u2019t know what to do with, and she stands in her tattered cloak looking timidly at me,\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd what does she want the money for? As if that money could add a hair\u2019s breadth to happiness or peace of mind. Can anything in the world make her or me less a prey to evil and death?\u2014death which ends all and must come today or tomorrow\u2014at any rate, in an instant as compared with eternity.\u201d And again he twisted the screw with the stripped thread, and again it turned uselessly in the same place.\n\nHis servant handed him a half-cut novel, in the form of letters, by Madame de Souza. He began reading about the sufferings and virtuous struggles of a certain Emilie de Mansfeld. \u201cAnd why did she resist her seducer when she loved him?\u201d he thought. \u201cGod could not have put into her heart an impulse that was against His will. My wife\u2014as she once was\u2014did not struggle, and perhaps she was right. Nothing has been found out, nothing discovered,\u201d Pierre again said to himself. \u201cAll we can know is that we know nothing. And that\u2019s the height of human wisdom.\u201d\n\nEverything within and around him seemed confused, senseless, and repellent. Yet in this very repugnance to all his circumstances Pierre found a kind of tantalizing satisfaction.\n\n\u201cI make bold to ask your excellency to move a little for this gentleman,\u201d said the postmaster, entering the room followed by another traveler, also detained for lack of horses.\n\nThe newcomer was a short, large-boned, yellow-faced, wrinkled old man, with gray bushy eyebrows overhanging bright eyes of an indefinite grayish color.\n\nPierre took his feet off the table, stood up, and lay down on a bed that had been got ready for him, glancing now and then at the newcomer, who, with a gloomy and tired face, was wearily taking off his wraps with the aid of his servant, and not looking at Pierre. With a pair of felt boots on his thin bony legs, and keeping on a worn, nankeen-covered, sheepskin coat, the traveler sat down on the sofa, leaned back his big head with its broad temples and close-cropped hair, and looked at Bez\u00fakhov. The stern, shrewd, and penetrating expression of that look struck Pierre. He felt a wish to speak to the stranger, but by the time he had made up his mind to ask him a question about the roads, the traveler had closed his eyes. His shriveled old hands were folded and on the finger of one of them Pierre noticed a large cast iron ring with a seal representing a death\u2019s head. The stranger sat without stirring, either resting or, as it seemed to Pierre, sunk in profound and calm meditation. His servant was also a yellow, wrinkled old man, without beard or mustache, evidently not because he was shaven but because they had never grown. This active old servant was unpacking the traveler\u2019s canteen and preparing tea. He brought in a boiling samovar. When everything was ready, the stranger opened his eyes, moved to the table, filled a tumbler with tea for himself and one for the beardless old man to whom he passed it. Pierre began to feel a sense of uneasiness, and the need, even the inevitability, of entering into conversation with this stranger.\n\nThe servant brought back his tumbler turned upside down, with an unfinished bit of nibbled sugar, and asked if anything more would be wanted.\n\n\u201cNo. Give me the book,\u201d said the stranger.\n\nThe servant handed him a book which Pierre took to be a devotional work, and the traveler became absorbed in it. Pierre looked at him. All at once the stranger closed the book, putting in a marker, and again, leaning with his arms on the back of the sofa, sat in his former position with his eyes shut. Pierre looked at him and had not time to turn away when the old man, opening his eyes, fixed his steady and severe gaze straight on Pierre\u2019s face.\n\nPierre felt confused and wished to avoid that look, but the bright old eyes attracted him irresistibly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\n\u201cI have the pleasure of addressing Count Bez\u00fakhov, if I am not mistaken,\u201d said the stranger in a deliberate and loud voice.\n\nPierre looked silently and inquiringly at him over his spectacles.\n\n\u201cI have heard of you, my dear sir,\u201d continued the stranger, \u201cand of your misfortune.\u201d He seemed to emphasize the last word, as if to say\u2014\u201cYes, misfortune! Call it what you please, I know that what happened to you in Moscow was a misfortune.\u201d\u2014\u201cI regret it very much, my dear sir.\u201d\n\nPierre flushed and, hurriedly putting his legs down from the bed, bent forward toward the old man with a forced and timid smile.\n\n\u201cI have not referred to this out of curiosity, my dear sir, but for greater reasons.\u201d\n\nHe paused, his gaze still on Pierre, and moved aside on the sofa by way of inviting the other to take a seat beside him. Pierre felt reluctant to enter into conversation with this old man, but, submitting to him involuntarily, came up and sat down beside him.\n\n\u201cYou are unhappy, my dear sir,\u201d the stranger continued. \u201cYou are young and I am old. I should like to help you as far as lies in my power.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d said Pierre, with a forced smile. \u201cI am very grateful to you. Where are you traveling from?\u201d\n\nThe stranger\u2019s face was not genial, it was even cold and severe, but in spite of this, both the face and words of his new acquaintance were irresistibly attractive to Pierre.\n\n\u201cBut if for any reason you don\u2019t feel inclined to talk to me,\u201d said the old man, \u201csay so, my dear sir.\u201d And he suddenly smiled, in an unexpected and tenderly paternal way.\n\n\u201cOh no, not at all! On the contrary, I am very glad to make your acquaintance,\u201d said Pierre. And again, glancing at the stranger\u2019s hands, he looked more closely at the ring, with its skull\u2014a Masonic sign.\n\n\u201cAllow me to ask,\u201d he said, \u201care you a Mason?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I belong to the Brotherhood of the Freemasons,\u201d said the stranger, looking deeper and deeper into Pierre\u2019s eyes. \u201cAnd in their name and my own I hold out a brotherly hand to you.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid,\u201d said Pierre, smiling, and wavering between the confidence the personality of the Freemason inspired in him and his own habit of ridiculing the Masonic beliefs\u2014\u201cI am afraid I am very far from understanding\u2014how am I to put it?\u2014I am afraid my way of looking at the world is so opposed to yours that we shall not understand one another.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know your outlook,\u201d said the Mason, \u201cand the view of life you mention, and which you think is the result of your own mental efforts, is the one held by the majority of people, and is the invariable fruit of pride, indolence, and ignorance. Forgive me, my dear sir, but if I had not known it I should not have addressed you. Your view of life is a regrettable delusion.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust as I may suppose you to be deluded,\u201d said Pierre, with a faint smile.\n\n\u201cI should never dare to say that I know the truth,\u201d said the Mason, whose words struck Pierre more and more by their precision and firmness. \u201cNo one can attain to truth by himself. Only by laying stone on stone with the cooperation of all, by the millions of generations from our forefather Adam to our own times, is that temple reared which is to be a worthy dwelling place of the Great God,\u201d he added, and closed his eyes.\n\n\u201cI ought to tell you that I do not believe... do not believe in God,\u201d said Pierre, regretfully and with an effort, feeling it essential to speak the whole truth.\n\nThe Mason looked intently at Pierre and smiled as a rich man with millions in hand might smile at a poor fellow who told him that he, poor man, had not the five rubles that would make him happy.\n\n\u201cYes, you do not know Him, my dear sir,\u201d said the Mason. \u201cYou cannot know Him. You do not know Him and that is why you are unhappy.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I am unhappy,\u201d assented Pierre. \u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know Him not, my dear sir, and so you are very unhappy. You do not know Him, but He is here, He is in me, He is in my words, He is in thee, and even in those blasphemous words thou hast just uttered!\u201d pronounced the Mason in a stern and tremulous voice.\n\nHe paused and sighed, evidently trying to calm himself.\n\n\u201cIf He were not,\u201d he said quietly, \u201cyou and I would not be speaking of Him, my dear sir. Of what, of whom, are we speaking? Whom hast thou denied?\u201d he suddenly asked with exulting austerity and authority in his voice. \u201cWho invented Him, if He did not exist? Whence came thy conception of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being? didst thou, and why did the whole world, conceive the idea of the existence of such an incomprehensible Being, a Being all-powerful, eternal, and infinite in all His attributes?...\u201d\n\nHe stopped and remained silent for a long time.\n\nPierre could not and did not wish to break this silence.\n\n\u201cHe exists, but to understand Him is hard,\u201d the Mason began again, looking not at Pierre but straight before him, and turning the leaves of his book with his old hands which from excitement he could not keep still. \u201cIf it were a man whose existence thou didst doubt I could bring him to thee, could take him by the hand and show him to thee. But how can I, an insignificant mortal, show His omnipotence, His infinity, and all His mercy to one who is blind, or who shuts his eyes that he may not see or understand Him and may not see or understand his own vileness and sinfulness?\u201d He paused again. \u201cWho art thou? Thou dreamest that thou art wise because thou couldst utter those blasphemous words,\u201d he went on, with a somber and scornful smile. \u201cAnd thou art more foolish and unreasonable than a little child, who, playing with the parts of a skillfully made watch, dares to say that, as he does not understand its use, he does not believe in the master who made it. To know Him is hard.... For ages, from our forefather Adam to our own day, we labor to attain that knowledge and are still infinitely far from our aim; but in our lack of understanding we see only our weakness and His greatness....\u201d\n\nPierre listened with swelling heart, gazing into the Mason\u2019s face with shining eyes, not interrupting or questioning him, but believing with his whole soul what the stranger said. Whether he accepted the wise reasoning contained in the Mason\u2019s words, or believed as a child believes, in the speaker\u2019s tone of conviction and earnestness, or the tremor of the speaker\u2019s voice\u2014which sometimes almost broke\u2014or those brilliant aged eyes grown old in this conviction, or the calm firmness and certainty of his vocation, which radiated from his whole being (and which struck Pierre especially by contrast with his own dejection and hopelessness)\u2014at any rate, Pierre longed with his whole soul to believe and he did believe, and felt a joyful sense of comfort, regeneration, and return to life.\n\n\u201cHe is not to be apprehended by reason, but by life,\u201d said the Mason.\n\n\u201cI do not understand,\u201d said Pierre, feeling with dismay doubts reawakening. He was afraid of any want of clearness, any weakness, in the Mason\u2019s arguments; he dreaded not to be able to believe in him. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he said, \u201chow it is that the mind of man cannot attain the knowledge of which you speak.\u201d\n\nThe Mason smiled with his gentle fatherly smile.\n\n\u201cThe highest wisdom and truth are like the purest liquid we may wish to imbibe,\u201d he said. \u201cCan I receive that pure liquid into an impure vessel and judge of its purity? Only by the inner purification of myself can I retain in some degree of purity the liquid I receive.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that is so,\u201d said Pierre joyfully.\n\n\u201cThe highest wisdom is not founded on reason alone, not on those worldly sciences of physics, history, chemistry, and the like, into which intellectual knowledge is divided. The highest wisdom is one. The highest wisdom has but one science\u2014the science of the whole\u2014the science explaining the whole creation and man\u2019s place i", "sequence": 8}, {"offset": 900000, "text": "n it. To receive that science it is necessary to purify and renew one\u2019s inner self, and so before one can know, it is necessary to believe and to perfect one\u2019s self. And to attain this end, we have the light called conscience that God has implanted in our souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre.\n\n\u201cLook then at thy inner self with the eyes of the spirit, and ask thyself whether thou art content with thyself. What hast thou attained relying on reason only? What art thou? You are young, you are rich, you are clever, you are well educated. And what have you done with all these good gifts? Are you content with yourself and with your life?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I hate my life,\u201d Pierre muttered, wincing.\n\n\u201cThou hatest it. Then change it, purify thyself; and as thou art purified, thou wilt gain wisdom. Look at your life, my dear sir. How have you spent it? In riotous orgies and debauchery, receiving everything from society and giving nothing in return. You have become the possessor of wealth. How have you used it? What have you done for your neighbor? Have you ever thought of your tens of thousands of slaves? Have you helped them physically and morally? No! You have profited by their toil to lead a profligate life. That is what you have done. Have you chosen a post in which you might be of service to your neighbor? No! You have spent your life in idleness. Then you married, my dear sir\u2014took on yourself responsibility for the guidance of a young woman; and what have you done? You have not helped her to find the way of truth, my dear sir, but have thrust her into an abyss of deceit and misery. A man offended you and you shot him, and you say you do not know God and hate your life. There is nothing strange in that, my dear sir!\u201d\n\nAfter these words, the Mason, as if tired by his long discourse, again leaned his arms on the back of the sofa and closed his eyes. Pierre looked at that aged, stern, motionless, almost lifeless face and moved his lips without uttering a sound. He wished to say, \u201cYes, a vile, idle, vicious life!\u201d but dared not break the silence.\n\nThe Mason cleared his throat huskily, as old men do, and called his servant.\n\n\u201cHow about the horses?\u201d he asked, without looking at Pierre.\n\n\u201cThe exchange horses have just come,\u201d answered the servant. \u201cWill you not rest here?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, tell them to harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan he really be going away leaving me alone without having told me all, and without promising to help me?\u201d thought Pierre, rising with downcast head; and he began to pace the room, glancing occasionally at the Mason. \u201cYes, I never thought of it, but I have led a contemptible and profligate life, though I did not like it and did not want to,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cBut this man knows the truth and, if he wished to, could disclose it to me.\u201d\n\nPierre wished to say this to the Mason, but did not dare to. The traveler, having packed his things with his practiced hands, began fastening his coat. When he had finished, he turned to Bez\u00fakhov, and said in a tone of indifferent politeness:\n\n\u201cWhere are you going to now, my dear sir?\u201d\n\n\u201cI?... I\u2019m going to Petersburg,\u201d answered Pierre, in a childlike, hesitating voice. \u201cI thank you. I agree with all you have said. But do not suppose me to be so bad. With my whole soul I wish to be what you would have me be, but I have never had help from anyone.... But it is I, above all, who am to blame for everything. Help me, teach me, and perhaps I may...\u201d\n\nPierre could not go on. He gulped and turned away.\n\nThe Mason remained silent for a long time, evidently considering.\n\n\u201cHelp comes from God alone,\u201d he said, \u201cbut such measure of help as our Order can bestow it will render you, my dear sir. You are going to Petersburg. Hand this to Count Willarski\u201d (he took out his notebook and wrote a few words on a large sheet of paper folded in four). \u201cAllow me to give you a piece of advice. When you reach the capital, first of all devote some time to solitude and self-examination and do not resume your former way of life. And now I wish you a good journey, my dear sir,\u201d he added, seeing that his servant had entered... \u201cand success.\u201d\n\nThe traveler was Joseph Alex\u00e9evich Bazd\u00e9ev, as Pierre saw from the postmaster\u2019s book. Bazd\u00e9ev had been one of the best-known Freemasons and Martinists, even in Nov\u00edkov\u2019s time. For a long while after he had gone, Pierre did not go to bed or order horses but paced up and down the room, pondering over his vicious past, and with a rapturous sense of beginning anew pictured to himself the blissful, irreproachable, virtuous future that seemed to him so easy. It seemed to him that he had been vicious only because he had somehow forgotten how good it is to be virtuous. Not a trace of his former doubts remained in his soul. He firmly believed in the possibility of the brotherhood of men united in the aim of supporting one another in the path of virtue, and that is how Freemasonry presented itself to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nOn reaching Petersburg Pierre did not let anyone know of his arrival, he went nowhere and spent whole days in reading Thomas \u00e0 Kempis, whose book had been sent him by someone unknown. One thing he continually realized as he read that book: the joy, hitherto unknown to him, of believing in the possibility of attaining perfection, and in the possibility of active brotherly love among men, which Joseph Alex\u00e9evich had revealed to him. A week after his arrival, the young Polish count, Willarski, whom Pierre had known slightly in Petersburg society, came into his room one evening in the official and ceremonious manner in which D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s second had called on him, and, having closed the door behind him and satisfied himself that there was nobody else in the room, addressed Pierre.\n\n\u201cI have come to you with a message and an offer, Count,\u201d he said without sitting down. \u201cA person of very high standing in our Brotherhood has made application for you to be received into our Order before the usual term and has proposed to me to be your sponsor. I consider it a sacred duty to fulfill that person\u2019s wishes. Do you wish to enter the Brotherhood of Freemasons under my sponsorship?\u201d\n\nThe cold, austere tone of this man, whom he had almost always before met at balls, amiably smiling in the society of the most brilliant women, surprised Pierre.\n\n\u201cYes, I do wish it,\u201d said he.\n\nWillarski bowed his head.\n\n\u201cOne more question, Count,\u201d he said, \u201cwhich I beg you to answer in all sincerity\u2014not as a future Mason but as an honest man: have you renounced your former convictions\u2014do you believe in God?\u201d\n\nPierre considered.\n\n\u201cYes... yes, I believe in God,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cIn that case...\u201d began Willarski, but Pierre interrupted him.\n\n\u201cYes, I do believe in God,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cIn that case we can go,\u201d said Willarski. \u201cMy carriage is at your service.\u201d\n\nWillarski was silent throughout the drive. To Pierre\u2019s inquiries as to what he must do and how he should answer, Willarski only replied that brothers more worthy than he would test him and that Pierre had only to tell the truth.\n\nHaving entered the courtyard of a large house where the Lodge had its headquarters, and having ascended a dark staircase, they entered a small well-lit anteroom where they took off their cloaks without the aid of a servant. From there they passed into another room. A man in strange attire appeared at the door. Willarski, stepping toward him, said something to him in French in an undertone and then went up to a small wardrobe in which Pierre noticed garments such as he had never seen before. Having taken a kerchief from the cupboard, Willarski bound Pierre\u2019s eyes with it and tied it in a knot behind, catching some hairs painfully in the knot. Then he drew his face down, kissed him, and taking him by the hand led him forward. The hairs tied in the knot hurt Pierre and there were lines of pain on his face and a shamefaced smile. His huge figure, with arms hanging down and with a puckered, though smiling face, moved after Willarski with uncertain, timid steps.\n\nHaving led him about ten paces, Willarski stopped.\n\n\u201cWhatever happens to you,\u201d he said, \u201cyou must bear it all manfully if you have firmly resolved to join our Brotherhood.\u201d (Pierre nodded affirmatively.) \u201cWhen you hear a knock at the door, you will uncover your eyes,\u201d added Willarski. \u201cI wish you courage and success,\u201d and, pressing Pierre\u2019s hand, he went out.\n\nLeft alone, Pierre went on smiling in the same way. Once or twice he shrugged his shoulders and raised his hand to the kerchief, as if wishing to take it off, but let it drop again. The five minutes spent with his eyes bandaged seemed to him an hour. His arms felt numb, his legs almost gave way, it seemed to him that he was tired out. He experienced a variety of most complex sensations. He felt afraid of what would happen to him and still more afraid of showing his fear. He felt curious to know what was going to happen and what would be revealed to him; but most of all, he felt joyful that the moment had come when he would at last start on that path of regeneration and on the actively virtuous life of which he had been dreaming since he met Joseph Alex\u00e9evich. Loud knocks were heard at the door. Pierre took the bandage off his eyes and glanced around him. The room was in black darkness, only a small lamp was burning inside something white. Pierre went nearer and saw that the lamp stood on a black table on which lay an open book. The book was the Gospel, and the white thing with the lamp inside was a human skull with its cavities and teeth. After reading the first words of the Gospel: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God,\u201d Pierre went round the table and saw a large open box filled with something. It was a coffin with bones inside. He was not at all surprised by what he saw. Hoping to enter on an entirely new life quite unlike the old one, he expected everything to be unusual, even more unusual than what he was seeing. A skull, a coffin, the Gospel\u2014it seemed to him that he had expected all this and even more. Trying to stimulate his emotions he looked around. \u201cGod, death, love, the brotherhood of man,\u201d he kept saying to himself, associating these words with vague yet joyful ideas. The door opened and someone came in.\n\nBy the dim light, to which Pierre had already become accustomed, he saw a rather short man. Having evidently come from the light into the darkness, the man paused, then moved with cautious steps toward the table and placed on it his small leather-gloved hands.\n\nThis short man had on a white leather apron which covered his chest and part of his legs; he had on a kind of necklace above which rose a high white ruffle, outlining his rather long face which was lit up from below.\n\n\u201cFor what have you come hither?\u201d asked the newcomer, turning in Pierre\u2019s direction at a slight rustle made by the latter. \u201cWhy have you, who do not believe in the truth of the light and who have not seen the light, come here? What do you seek from us? Wisdom, virtue, enlightenment?\u201d\n\nAt the moment the door opened and the stranger came in, Pierre felt a sense of awe and veneration such as he had experienced in his boyhood at confession; he felt himself in the presence of one socially a complete stranger, yet nearer to him through the brotherhood of man. With bated breath and beating heart he moved toward the Rhetor (by which name the brother who prepared a seeker for entrance into the Brotherhood was known). Drawing nearer, he recognized in the Rhetor a man he knew, Smolyan\u00ednov, and it mortified him to think that the newcomer was an acquaintance\u2014he wished him simply a brother and a virtuous instructor. For a long time he could not utter a word, so that the Rhetor had to repeat his question.\n\n\u201cYes... I... I... desire regeneration,\u201d Pierre uttered with difficulty.\n\n\u201cVery well,\u201d said Smolyan\u00ednov, and went on at once: \u201cHave you any idea of the means by which our holy Order will help you to reach your aim?\u201d said he quietly and quickly.\n\n\u201cI... hope... for guidance... help... in regeneration,\u201d said Pierre, with a trembling voice and some difficulty in utterance due to his excitement and to being unaccustomed to speak of abstract matters in Russian.\n\n\u201cWhat is your conception of Freemasonry?\u201d\n\n\u201cI imagine that Freemasonry is the fraternity and equality of men who have virtuous aims,\u201d said Pierre, feeling ashamed of the inadequacy of his words for the solemnity of the moment, as he spoke. \u201cI imagine...\u201d\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said the Rhetor quickly, apparently satisfied with this answer. \u201cHave you sought for means of attaining your aim in religion?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I considered it erroneous and did not follow it,\u201d said Pierre, so softly that the Rhetor did not hear him and asked him what he was saying. \u201cI have been an atheist,\u201d answered Pierre.\n\n\u201cYou are seeking for truth in order to follow its laws in your life, therefore you seek wisdom and virtue. Is that not so?\u201d said the Rhetor, after a moment\u2019s pause.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre.\n\nThe Rhetor cleared his throat, crossed his gloved hands on his breast, and began to speak.\n\n\u201cNow I must disclose to you the chief aim of our Order,\u201d he said, \u201cand if this aim coincides with yours, you may enter our Brotherhood with profit. The first and chief object of our Order, the foundation on which it rests and which no human power can destroy, is the preservation and handing on to posterity of a certain important mystery... which has come down to us from the remotest ages, even from the first man\u2014a mystery on which perhaps the fate of mankind depends. But since this mystery is of such a nature that nobody can know or use it unless he be prepared by long and diligent self-purification, not everyone can hope to attain it quickly. Hence we have a secondary aim, that of preparing our members as much as possible to reform their hearts, to purify and enlighten their minds, by means handed on to us by tradition from those who have striven to attain this mystery, and thereby to render them capable of receiving it.\n\n\u201cBy purifying and regenerating our members we try, thirdly, to improve the whole human race, offering it in our members an example of piety and virtue, and thereby try with all our might to combat the evil which sways the world. Think this over and I will come to you again.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo combat the evil which sways the world...\u201d Pierre repeated, and a mental image of his future activity in this direction rose in his mind. He imagined men such as he had himself been a fortnight ago, and he addressed an edifying exhortation to them. He imagined to himself vicious and unfortunate people whom he would assist by word and deed, imagined oppressors whose victims he would rescue. Of the three objects mentioned by the Rhetor, this last, that of improving mankind, especially appealed to Pierre. The important mystery mentioned by the Rhetor, though it aroused his curiosity, did not seem to him essential, and the second aim, that of purifying and regenerating himself, did not much interest him because at that moment he felt with delight that he was already perfectly cured of his former faults and was ready for all that was good.\n\nHalf an hour later, the Rhetor returned to inform the seeker of the seven virtues, corresponding to the seven steps of Solomon\u2019s temple, which every Freemason should cultivate in himself. These virtues were: 1. Discretion, the keeping of the secrets of the Order. 2. Obedience to those of higher ranks in the Order. 3. Morality. 4. Love of mankind. 5. Courage. 6. Generosity. 7. The love of death.\n\n\u201cIn the seventh place, try, by the frequent thought of death,\u201d the Rhetor said, \u201cto bring yourself to regard it not as a dreaded foe, but as a friend that frees the soul grown weary in the labors of virtue from this distressful life, and leads it to its place of recompense and peace.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that must be so,\u201d thought Pierre, when after these words the Rhetor went away, leaving him to solitary meditation. \u201cIt must be so, but I am still so weak that I love my life, the meaning of which is only now gradually opening before me.\u201d But five of the other virtues which Pierre recalled, counting them on his fingers, he felt already in his soul: courage, generosity, morality, love of mankind, and especially obedience\u2014which did not even seem to him a virtue, but a joy. (He now felt so glad to be free from his own lawlessness and to submit his will to those who knew the indubitable truth.) He forgot what the seventh virtue was and could not recall it.\n\nThe third time the Rhetor came back more quickly and asked Pierre whether he was still firm in his intention and determined to submit to all that would be required of him.\n\n\u201cI am ready for everything,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cI must also inform you,\u201d said the Rhetor, \u201cthat our Order delivers its teaching not in words only but also by other means, which may perhaps have a stronger effect on the sincere seeker after wisdom and virtue than mere words. This chamber with what you see therein should already have suggested to your heart, if it is sincere, more than words could do. You will perhaps also see in your further initiation a like method of enlightenment. Our Order imitates the ancient societies that explained their teaching by hieroglyphics. A hieroglyph,\u201d said the Rhetor, \u201cis an emblem of something not cognizable by the senses but which possesses qualities resembling those of the symbol.\u201d\n\nPierre knew very well what a hieroglyph was, but dared not speak. He listened to the Rhetor in silence, feeling from all he said that his ordeal was about to begin.\n\n\u201cIf you are resolved, I must begin your initiation,\u201d said the Rhetor coming closer to Pierre. \u201cIn token of generosity I ask you to give me all your valuables.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I have nothing here,\u201d replied Pierre, supposing that he was asked to give up all he possessed.\n\n\u201cWhat you have with you: watch, money, rings....\u201d\n\nPierre quickly took out his purse and watch, but could not manage for some time to get the wedding ring off his fat finger. When that had been done, the Rhetor said:\n\n\u201cIn token of obedience, I ask you to undress.\u201d\n\nPierre took off his coat, waistcoat, and left boot according to the Rhetor\u2019s instructions. The Mason drew the shirt back from Pierre\u2019s left breast, and stooping down pulled up the left leg of his trousers to above the knee. Pierre hurriedly began taking off his right boot also and was going to tuck up the other trouser leg to save this stranger the trouble, but the Mason told him that was not necessary and gave him a slipper for his left foot. With a childlike smile of embarrassment, doubt, and self-derision, which appeared on his face against his will, Pierre stood with his arms hanging down and legs apart, before his brother Rhetor, and awaited his further commands.\n\n\u201cAnd now, in token of candor, I ask you to reveal to me your chief passion,\u201d said the latter.\n\n\u201cMy passion! I have had so many,\u201d replied Pierre.\n\n\u201cThat passion which more than all others caused you to waver on the path of virtue,\u201d said the Mason.\n\nPierre paused, seeking a reply.\n\n\u201cWine? Gluttony? Idleness? Laziness? Irritability? Anger? Women?\u201d He went over his vices in his mind, not knowing to which of them to give the pre-eminence.\n\n\u201cWomen,\u201d he said in a low, scarcely audible voice.\n\nThe Mason did not move and for a long time said nothing after this answer. At last he moved up to Pierre and, taking the kerchief that lay on the table, again bound his eyes.\n\n\u201cFor the last time I say to you\u2014turn all your attention upon yourself, put a bridle on your senses, and seek blessedness, not in passion but in your own heart. The source of blessedness is not without us but within....\u201d\n\nPierre had already long been feeling in himself that refreshing source of blessedness which now flooded his heart with glad emotion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nSoon after this there came into the dark chamber to fetch Pierre, not the Rhetor but Pierre\u2019s sponsor, Willarski, whom he recognized by his voice. To fresh questions as to the firmness of his resolution Pierre replied: \u201cYes, yes, I agree,\u201d and with a beaming, childlike smile, his fat chest uncovered, stepping unevenly and timidly in one slippered and one booted foot, he advanced, while Willarski held a sword to his bare chest. He was conducted from that room along passages that turned backwards and forwards and was at last brought to the doors of the Lodge. Willarski coughed, he was answered by the Masonic knock with mallets, the doors opened before them. A bass voice (Pierre was still blindfolded) questioned him as to who he was, when and where he was born, and so on. Then he was again led somewhere still blindfolded, and as they went along he was told allegories of the toils of his pilgrimage, of holy friendship, of the Eternal Architect of the universe, and of the courage with which he should endure toils and dangers. During these wanderings, Pierre noticed that he was spoken of now as the \u201cSeeker,\u201d now as the \u201cSufferer,\u201d and now as the \u201cPostulant,\u201d to the accompaniment of various knockings with mallets and swords. As he was being led up to some object he noticed a hesitation and uncertainty among his conductors. He heard those around him disputing in whispers and one of them insisting that he should be led along a certain carpet. After that they took his right hand, placed it on something, and told him to hold a pair of compasses to his left breast with the other hand and to repeat after someone who read aloud an oath of fidelity to the laws of the Order. The candles were then extinguished and some spirit lighted, as Pierre knew by the smell, and he was told that he would now see the lesser light. The bandage was taken off his eyes and, by the faint light of the burning spirit, Pierre, as in a dream, saw several men standing before him, wearing aprons like the Rhetor\u2019s and holding swords in their hands pointed at his breast. Among them stood a man whose white shirt was stained with blood. On seeing this, Pierre moved forward with his breast toward the swords, meaning them to pierce it. But the swords were drawn back from him and he was at once blindfolded again.\n\n\u201cNow thou hast seen the lesser light,\u201d uttered a voice. Then the candles were relit and he was told that he would see the full light; the bandage was again removed and more than ten voices said together: \u201cSic transit gloria mundi.\u201d\n\nPierre gradually began to recover himself and looked about at the room and at the people in it. Round a long table covered with black sat some twelve men in garments like those he had already seen. Some of them Pierre had met in Petersburg society. In the President\u2019s chair sat a young man he did not know, with a peculiar cross hanging from his neck. On his right sat the Italian abb\u00e9 whom Pierre had met at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s two years before. There were also present a very distinguished dignitary and a Swiss who had formerly been tutor at the Kur\u00e1gins\u2019. All maintained a solemn silence, listening to the words of the President, who held a mallet in his hand. Let into the wall was a star-shaped light. At one side of the table was a small carpet with various figures worked upon it, at the other was something resembling an altar on which lay a Testament and a skull. Round it stood seven large candlesticks like those used in churches. Two of the brothers led Pierre up to the altar, placed his feet at right angles, and bade him lie down, saying that he must prostrate himself at the Gates of the Temple.\n\n\u201cHe must first receive the trowel,\u201d whispered one of the brothers.\n\n\u201cOh, hush, please!\u201d said another.\n\nPierre, perplexed, looked round with his shortsighted eyes without obeying, and suddenly doubts arose in his mind. \u201cWhere am I? What am I doing? Aren\u2019t they laughing at me? Shan\u2019t I be ashamed to remember this?\u201d But these doubts only lasted a moment. Pierre glanced at the serious faces of those around, remembered all he had already gone through, and realized that he could not stop halfway. He was aghast at his hesitation and, trying to arouse his former devotional feeling, prostrated himself before the Gates of the Temple. And really, the feeling of devotion returned to him even more strongly than before. When he had lain there some time, he was told to get up, and a white leather apron, such as the others wore, was put on him: he was given a trowel and three pairs of gloves, and then the Grand Master addressed him. He told him that he should try to do nothing to stain the whiteness of that apron, which symbolized strength and purity; then of the unexplained trowel, he told him to toil with it to cleanse his own heart from vice, and indulgently to smooth with it the heart of his neighbor. As to the first pair of gloves, a man\u2019s, he said that Pierre could not know their meaning but must keep them. The second pair of man\u2019s gloves he was to wear at the meetings, and finally of the third, a pair of women\u2019s gloves, he said: \u201cDear brother, these woman\u2019s gloves are intended for you too. Give them to the woman whom you shall honor most of all. This gift will be a pledge of your purity of heart to her whom you select to be your worthy helpmeet in Masonry.\u201d And after a pause, he added: \u201cBut beware, dear brother, that these gloves do not deck hands that are unclean.\u201d While the Grand Master said these last words it seemed to Pierre that he grew embarrassed. Pierre himself grew still more confused, blushed like a child till tears came to his eyes, began looking about him uneasily, and an awkward pause followed.\n\nThis silence was broken by one of the brethren, who led Pierre up to the rug and began reading to him from a manuscript book an explanation of all the figures on it: the sun, the moon, a hammer, a plumb line, a trowel, a rough stone and a squared stone, a pillar, three windows, and so on. Then a place was assigned to Pierre, he was shown the signs of the Lodge, told the password, and at last was permitted to sit down. The Grand Master began reading the statutes. They were very long, and Pierre, from joy, agitation, and embarrassment, was not in a state to understand what was being read. He managed to follow only the last words of the statutes and these remained in his mind.\n\n\u201cIn our temples we recognize no other distinctions,\u201d read the Grand Master, \u201cbut those between virtue and vice. Beware of making any distinctions which may infringe equality. Fly to a brother\u2019s aid whoever he may be, exhort him who goeth astray, raise him that falleth, never bear malice or enmity toward thy brother. Be kindly and courteous. Kindle in all hearts the flame of virtue. Share thy happiness with thy neighbor, and may envy never dim the purity of that bliss. Forgive thy enemy, do not avenge thyself except by doing him good. Thus fulfilling the highest law thou shalt regain traces of the ancient dignity which thou hast lost.\u201d\n\nHe finished and, getting up, embraced and kissed Pierre, who, with tears of joy in his eyes, looked round him, not knowing how to answer the congratulations and greetings from acquaintances that met him on all sides. He acknowledged no acquaintances but saw in all these men only brothers, and burned with impatience to set to work with them.\n\nThe Grand Master rapped with his mallet. All the Masons sat down in their places, and one of them read an exhortation on the necessity of humility.\n\nThe Grand Master proposed that the last duty should be performed, and the distinguished dignitary who bore the title of \u201cCollector of Alms\u201d went round to all the brothers. Pierre would have liked to subscribe all he had, but fearing that it might look like pride subscribed the same amount as the others.\n\nThe meeting was at an end, and on reaching home Pierre felt as if he had returned from a long journey on which he had spent dozens of years, had become completely changed, and had quite left behind his former habits and way of life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe day after he had been received into the Lodge, Pierre was sitting at home reading a book and trying to fathom the significance of the Square, one side of which symbolized God, another moral things, a third physical things, and the fourth a combination of these. Now and then his attention wandered from the book and the Square and he formed in imagination a new plan of life. On the previous evening at the Lodge, he had heard that a rumor of his duel had reached the Emperor and that it would be wiser for him to leave Petersburg. Pierre proposed going to his estates in the south and there attending to the welfare of his serfs. He was joyfully planning this new life, when Prince Vas\u00edli suddenly entered the room.\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, what have you been up to in Moscow? Why have you quarreled with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, mon cher? You are under a delusion,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli, as he entered. \u201cI know all about it, and I can tell you positively that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne is as innocent before you as Christ was before the Jews.\u201d\n\nPierre was about to reply, but Prince Vas\u00edli interrupted him.\n\n\u201cAnd why didn\u2019t you simply come straight to me as to a friend? I know all about it and understand it all,\u201d he said. \u201cYou behaved as becomes a man who values his honor, perhaps too hastily, but we won\u2019t go into that. But consider the position in which you are placing her and me in the eyes of society, and even of the court,\u201d he added, lowering his voice. \u201cShe is living in Moscow and you are here. Remember, dear boy,\u201d and he drew Pierre\u2019s arm downwards, \u201cit is simply a misunderstanding. I expect you feel it so yourself. Let us write her a letter at once, and she\u2019ll come here and all will be explained, or else, my dear boy, let me tell you it\u2019s quite likely you\u2019ll have to suffer for it.\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli gave Pierre a significant look.\n\n\u201cI know from reliable sources that the Dowager Empress is taking a keen interest in the whole affair. You know she is very gracious to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\u201d\n\nPierre tried several times to speak, but, on one hand, Prince Vas\u00edli did not let him and, on the other, Pierre himself feared to begin to speak in the tone of decided refusal and disagreement in which he had firmly resolved to answer his father-in-law. Moreover, the words of the Masonic statutes, \u201cbe kindly and courteous,\u201d recurred to him. He blinked, went red, got up and sat down again, struggling with himself to do what was for him the most difficult thing in life\u2014to say an unpleasant thing to a man\u2019s face, to say what the other, whoever he might be, did not expect. He was so used to submitting to Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s tone of careless self-assurance that he felt he would be unable to withstand it now, but he also felt that on what he said now his future depended\u2014whether he would follow the same old road, or that new path so attractively shown him by the Masons, on which he firmly believed he would be reborn to a new life.\n\n\u201cNow, dear boy,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli playfully, \u201csay \u2018yes,\u2019 and I\u2019ll write to her myself, and we will kill the fatted calf.\u201d\n\nBut before Prince Vas\u00edli had finished his playful speech, Pierre, without looking at him, and with a kind of fury that made him like his father, muttered in a whisper:\n\n\u201cPrince, I did not ask you here. Go, please go!\u201d And he jumped up and opened the door for him.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d he repeated, amazed at himself and glad to see the look of confusion and fear that showed itself on Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Are you ill?\u201d\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d the quivering voice repeated. And Prince Vas\u00edli had to go without receiving any explanation.\n\nA week later, Pierre, having taken leave of his new friends, the Masons, and leaving large sums of money with them for alms, went away to his estates. His new brethren gave him letters to the Kiev and Odessa Masons and promised to write to him and guide him in his new activity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe duel between Pierre and D\u00f3lokhov was hushed up and, in spite of the Emperor\u2019s severity regarding duels at that time, neither the principals nor their seconds suffered for it. But the story of the duel, confirmed by Pierre\u2019s rupture with his wife, was the talk of society. Pierre who had been regarded with patronizing condescension when he was an illegitimate son, and petted and extolled when he was the best match in Russia, had sunk greatly in the esteem of society after his marriage\u2014when the marriageable daughters and their mothers had nothing to hope from him\u2014especially as he did not know how, and did not wish, to court society\u2019s favor. Now he alone was blamed for what had happened, he was said to be insanely jealous and subject like his father to fits of bloodthirsty rage. And when after Pierre\u2019s departure H\u00e9l\u00e8ne returned to Petersburg, she was received by all her acquaintances not only cordially, but even with a shade of deference due to her misfortune. When conversation turned on her husband H\u00e9l\u00e8ne assumed a dignified expression, which with characteristic tact she had acquired though she did not understand its significance. This expression suggested that she had resolved to endure her troubles uncomplainingly and that her husband was a cross laid upon her by God. Prince Vas\u00edli expressed his opinion more openly. He shrugged his shoulders when Pierre was mentioned and, pointing to his forehead, remarked:\n\n\u201cA bit touched\u2014I always said so.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said from the first,\u201d declared Anna P\u00e1vlovna referring to Pierre, \u201cI said at the time and before anyone else\u201d (she insisted on her priority) \u201cthat that senseless young man was spoiled by the depraved ideas of these days. I said so even at the time when everybody was in raptures about him, when he had just returned from abroad, and when, if you remember, he posed as a sort of Marat at one of my soirees. And how has it ended? I was against this marriage even then and foretold all that has happened.\u201d\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna continued to give on free evenings the same kind of soirees as before\u2014such as she alone had the gift of arranging\u2014at which was to be found \u201cthe cream of really good society, the bloom of the intellectual essence of Petersburg,\u201d as she herself put it. Besides this refined selection of society Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s receptions were also distinguished by the fact that she always presented some new and interesting person to the visitors and that nowhere else was the state of the political thermometer of legitimate Petersburg court society so dearly and distinctly indicated.\n\nToward the end of 1806, when all the sad details of Napoleon\u2019s destruction of the Prussian army at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt and the surrender of most of the Prussian fortresses had been received, when our troops had already entered Prussia and our second war with Napoleon was beginning, Anna P\u00e1vlovna gave one of her soirees. The \u201ccream of really good society\u201d consisted of the fascinating H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, forsaken by her husband, Mortemart, the delightful Prince Hippolyte who had just returned from Vienna, two diplomatists, the old aunt, a young man referred to in that drawing room as \u201ca man of great merit\u201d (un homme de beaucoup de m\u00e9rite), a newly appointed maid of honor and her mother, and several other less noteworthy persons.\n\nThe novelty Anna P\u00e1vlovna was setting before her guests that evening was Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, who had just arrived as a special messenger from the Prussian army and was aide-de-camp to a very important personage.\n\nThe temperature shown by the political thermometer to the company that evening was this:\n\n\u201cWhatever the European sovereigns and commanders may do to countenance Bonaparte, and to cause me, and us in general, annoyance and mortification, our opinion of Bonaparte cannot alter. We shall not cease to express our sincere views on that subject, and can only say to the King of Prussia and others: \u2018So much the worse for you. Tu l\u2019as voulu, George Dandin,\u2019 that\u2019s all we have to say about it!\u201d\n\nWhen Bor\u00eds, who was to be served up to the guests, entered the drawing room, almost all the company had assembled, and the conversation, guided by Anna P\u00e1vlovna, was about our diplomatic relations with Austria and the hope of an alliance with her.\n\nBor\u00eds, grown more manly and looking fresh, rosy and self-possessed, entered the drawing room elegantly dressed in the uniform of an aide-de-camp and was duly conducted to pay his respects to the aunt and then brought back to the general circle.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna gave him her shriveled hand to kiss and introduced him to several persons whom he did not know, giving him a whispered description of each.\n\n\u201cPrince Hippolyte Kur\u00e1gin\u2014charming young fellow; M. Kronq,\u2014charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires from Copenhagen\u2014a profound intellect,\u201d and simply, \u201cMr. Sh\u00edtov\u2014a man of great merit\u201d\u2014this of the man usually so described.\n\nThanks to Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2019s efforts, his own tastes, and the peculiarities of his reserved nature, Bor\u00eds had managed during his service to place himself very advantageously. He was aide-de-camp to a very important personage, had been sent on a very important mission to Prussia, and had just returned from there as a special messenger. He had become thoroughly conversant with that unwritten code with which he had been so pleased at Olm\u00fctz and according to which an ensign might rank incomparably higher than a general, and according to which what was needed for success in the service was not effort or work, or courage, or perseverance, but only the knowledge of how to get on with those who can grant rewards, and he was himself often surprised at the rapidity of his success and at the inability of others to understand these things. In consequence of this discovery his whole manner of life, all his relations with old friends, all his plans for his future, were completely altered. He was not rich, but would spend his last groat to be better dressed than others, and would rather deprive himself of many pleasures than allow himself to be seen in a shabby equipage or appear in the streets of Petersburg in an old uniform. He made friends with and sought the acquaintance of only those above him in position and who could therefore be of use to him. He liked Petersburg and despised Moscow. The remembrance of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house and of his childish love for Nat\u00e1sha was unpleasant to him and he had not once been to see the Rost\u00f3vs since the day of his departure for the army. To be in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s drawing room he considered an important step up in the service, and he at once understood his role, letting his hostess make use of whatever interest he had to offer. He himself carefully scanned each face, appraising the possibilities of establishing intimacy with each of those present, and the advantages that might accrue. He took the seat indicated to him beside the fair H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and listened to the general conversation.\n\n\u201cVienna considers the bases of the proposed treaty so unattainable that not even a continuity of most brilliant successes would secure them, and she doubts the means we have of gaining them. That is the actual phrase used by the Vienna cabinet,\u201d said the Danish charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires.\n\n\u201cThe doubt is flattering,\u201d said \u201cthe man of profound intellect,\u201d with a subtle smile.\n\n\u201cWe must distinguish between the Vienna cabinet and the Emperor of Austria,\u201d said Mortemart. \u201cThe Emperor of Austria can never have thought of such a thing, it is only the cabinet that says it.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, my dear vicomte,\u201d put in Anna P\u00e1vlovna, \u201cL\u2019Urope\u201d (for some reason she called it Urope as if that were a specially refined French pronunciation which she could allow herself when conversing with a Frenchman), \u201cL\u2019Urope ne sera jamais notre alli\u00e9e sinc\u00e8re.\u201d\n\nAfter that Anna P\u00e1vlovna led up to the courage and firmness of the King of Prussia, in order to draw Bor\u00eds into the conversation.\n\nBor\u00eds listened attentively to each of the speakers, awaiting his turn, but managed meanwhile to look round repeatedly at his neighbor, the beautiful H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, whose eyes several times met those of the handsome young aide-de-camp with a smile.\n\nSpeaking of the position of Prussia, Anna P\u00e1vlovna very naturally asked Bor\u00eds to tell them about his journey to Glogau and in what state he found the Prussian army. Bor\u00eds, speaking with deliberation, told them in pure, correct French many interesting details about the armies and the court, carefully abstaining from expressing an opinion of his own about the facts he was recounting. For some time he engrossed the general attention, and Anna P\u00e1vlovna felt that the novelty she had served up was received with pleasure by all her visitors. The greatest attention of all to Bor\u00eds\u2019 narrative was shown by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. She asked him several questions about his journey and seemed greatly interested in the state of the Prussian army. As soon as he had finished she turned to him with her usual smile.\n\n\u201cYou absolutely must come and see me,\u201d she said in a tone that implied that, for certain considerations he could not know of, this was absolutely necessary.\n\n\u201cOn Tuesday between eight and nine. It will give me great pleasure.\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds promised to fulfill her wish and was about to begin a conversation with her, when Anna P\u00e1vlovna called him away on the pretext that her aunt wished to hear him.\n\n\u201cYou know her husband, of course?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, closing her eyes and indicating H\u00e9l\u00e8ne with a sorrowful gesture. \u201cAh, she is such an unfortunate and charming woman! Don\u2019t mention him before her\u2014please don\u2019t! It is too painful for her!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen Bor\u00eds and Anna P\u00e1vlovna returned to the others Prince Hippolyte had the ear of the company.\n\nBending forward in his armchair he said: \u201cLe Roi de Prusse!\u201d and having said this laughed. Everyone turned toward him.\n\n\u201cLe Roi de Prusse?\u201d Hippolyte said interrogatively, again laughing, and then calmly and seriously sat back in his chair. Anna P\u00e1vlovna waited for him to go on, but as he seemed quite decided to say no more she began to tell of how at Potsdam the impious Bonaparte had stolen the sword of Frederick the Great.\n\n\u201cIt is the sword of Frederick the Great which I...\u201d she began, but Hippolyte interrupted her with the words: \u201cLe Roi de Prusse...\u201d and again, as soon as all turned toward him, excused himself and said no more.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna frowned. Mortemart, Hippolyte\u2019s friend, addressed him firmly.\n\n\u201cCome now, what about your Roi de Prusse?\u201d\n\nHippolyte laughed as if ashamed of laughing.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s nothing. I only wished to say...\u201d (he wanted to repeat a joke he had heard in Vienna and which he had been trying all that evening to get in) \u201cI only wished to say that we are wrong to fight pour le Roi de Prusse!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds smiled circumspectly, so that it might be taken as ironical or appreciative according to the way the joke was received. Everybody laughed.\n\n\u201cYour joke is too bad, it\u2019s witty but unjust,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, shaking her little shriveled finger at him.\n\n\u201cWe are not fighting pour le Roi de Prusse, but for right principles. Oh, that wicked Prince Hippolyte!\u201d she said.\n\nThe conversation did not flag all evening and turned chiefly on the political news. It became particularly animated toward the end of the evening when the rewards bestowed by the Emperor were mentioned.\n\n\u201cYou know N\u2014 N\u2014 received a snuffbox with the portrait last year?\u201d said \u201cthe man of profound intellect.\u201d \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t S\u2014 S\u2014 get the same distinction?\u201d\n\n\u201cPardon me! A snuffbox with the Emperor\u2019s portrait is a reward but not a distinction,\u201d said the diplomatist\u2014\u201ca gift, rather.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are precedents, I may mention Schwarzenberg.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s impossible,\u201d replied another.\n\n\u201cWill you bet? The ribbon of the order is a different matter....\u201d\n\nWhen everybody rose to go, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who had spoken very little all the evening again turned to Bor\u00eds, asking him in a tone of caressing significant command to come to her on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cIt is of great importance to me,\u201d she said, turning with a smile toward Anna P\u00e1vlovna, and Anna P\u00e1vlovna, with the same sad smile with which she spoke of her exalted patroness, supported H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s wish.\n\nIt seemed as if from some words Bor\u00eds had spoken that evening about the Prussian army, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had suddenly found it necessary to see him. She seemed to promise to explain that necessity to him when he came on Tuesday.\n\nBut on Tuesday evening, having come to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s splendid salon, Bor\u00eds received no clear explanation of why it had been necessary for him to come. There were other guests and the countess talked little to him, and only as he kissed her hand on taking leave said unexpectedly and in a whisper, with a strangely unsmiling face: \u201cCome to dinner tomorrow... in the evening. You must come.... Come!\u201d\n\nDuring that stay in Petersburg, Bor\u00eds became an intimate in the countess\u2019 house.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe war was flaming up and nearing the Russian frontier. Everywhere one heard curses on Bonaparte, \u201cthe enemy of mankind.\u201d Militiamen and recruits were being enrolled in the villages, and from the seat of war came contradictory news, false as usual and therefore variously interpreted. The life of old Prince Bolk\u00f3nski, Prince Andrew, and Princess Mary had greatly changed since 1805.\n\nIn 1806 the old prince was made one of the eight commanders in chief then appointed to supervise the enrollment decreed throughout Russia. Despite the weakness of age, which had become particularly noticeable since the time when he thought his son had been killed, he did not think it right to refuse a duty to which he had been appointed by the Emperor himself, and this fresh opportunity for action gave him new energy and strength. He was continually traveling through the three provinces entrusted to him, was pedantic in the fulfillment of his duties, severe to cruel with his subordinates, and went into everything down to the minutest details himself. Princess Mary had ceased taking lessons in mathematics from her father, and when the old prince was at home went to his study with the wet nurse and little Prince Nicholas (as his grandfather called him). The baby Prince Nicholas lived with his wet nurse and nurse S\u00e1vishna in the late princess\u2019 rooms and Princess Mary spent most of the day in the nursery, taking a mother\u2019s place to her little nephew as best she could. Mademoiselle Bourienne, too, seemed passionately fond of the boy, and Princess Mary often deprived herself to give her friend the pleasure of dandling the little angel\u2014as she called her nephew\u2014and playing with him.\n\nNear the altar of the church at Bald Hills there was a chapel over the tomb of the little princess, and in this chapel was a marble monument brought from Italy, representing an angel with outspread wings ready to fly upwards. The angel\u2019s upper lip was slightly raised as though about to smile, and once on coming out of the chapel Prince Andrew and Princess Mary admitted to one another that the angel\u2019s face reminded them strangely of the little princess. But what was still stranger, though of this Prince Andrew said nothing to his sister, was that in the expression the sculptor had happened to give the angel\u2019s face, Prince Andrew read the same mild reproach he had read on the face of his dead wife: \u201cAh, why have you done this to me?\u201d\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew\u2019s return the old prince made over to him a large estate, Boguch\u00e1rovo, about twenty-five miles from Bald Hills. Partly because of the depressing memories associated with Bald Hills, partly because Prince Andrew did not always feel equal to bearing with his father\u2019s peculiarities, and partly because he needed solitude, Prince Andrew made use of Boguch\u00e1rovo, began building and spent most of his time there.\n\nAfter the Austerlitz campaign Prince Andrew had firmly resolved not to continue his military service, and when the war recommenced and everybody had to serve, he took a post under his father in the recruitment so as to avoid active service. The old prince and his son seemed to have changed roles since the campaign of 1805. The old man, roused by activity, expected the best results from the new campaign, while Prince Andrew on the contrary, taking no part in the war and secretly regretting this, saw only the dark side.\n\nOn February 26, 1807, the old prince set off on one of his circuits. Prince Andrew remained at Bald Hills as usual during his father\u2019s absence. Little Nicholas had been unwell for four days. The coachman who had driven the old prince to town returned bringing papers and letters for Prince Andrew.\n\nNot finding the young prince in his study the valet went with the letters to Princess Mary\u2019s apartments, but did not find him there. He was told that the prince had gone to the nursery.\n\n\u201cIf you please, your excellency, P\u00e9trusha has brought some papers,\u201d said one of the nursemaids to Prince Andrew who was sitting on a child\u2019s little chair while, frowning and with trembling hands, he poured drops from a medicine bottle into a wineglass half full of water.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d he said crossly, and, his hand shaking unintentionally, he poured too many drops into the glass. He threw the mixture onto the floor and asked for some more water. The maid brought it.\n\nThere were in the room a child\u2019s cot, two boxes, two armchairs, a table, a child\u2019s table, and the little chair on which Prince Andrew was sitting. The curtains were drawn, and a single candle was burning on the table, screened by a bound music book so that the light did not fall on the cot.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Princess Mary, addressing her brother from beside the cot where she was standing, \u201cbetter wait a bit... later...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, leave off, you always talk nonsense and keep putting things off\u2014and this is what comes of it!\u201d said Prince Andrew in an exasperated whisper, evidently meaning to wound his sister.\n\n\u201cMy dear, really... it\u2019s better not to wake him... he\u2019s asleep,\u201d said the princess in a tone of entreaty.\n\nPrince Andrew got up and went on tiptoe up to the little bed, wineglass in hand.\n\n\u201cPerhaps we\u2019d really better not wake him,\u201d he said hesitating.\n\n\u201cAs you please... really... I think so... but as you please,\u201d said Princess Mary, evidently intimidated and confused that her opinion had prevailed. She drew her brother\u2019s attention to the maid who was calling him in a whisper.\n\nIt was the second night that neither of them had slept, watching the boy who was in a high fever. These last days, mistrusting their household doctor and expecting another for whom they had sent to town, they had been trying first one remedy and then another. Worn out by sleeplessness and anxiety they threw their burden of sorrow on one another and reproached and disputed with each other.\n\n\u201cP\u00e9trusha has come with papers from your father,\u201d whispered the maid.\n\nPrince Andrew went out.\n\n\u201cDevil take them!\u201d he muttered, and after listening to the verbal instructions his father had sent and taking the correspondence and his father\u2019s letter, he returned to the nursery.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cStill the same. Wait, for heaven\u2019s sake. Karl Iv\u00e1nich always says that sleep is more important than anything,\u201d whispered Princess Mary with a sigh.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to the child and felt him. He was burning hot.\n\n\u201cConfound you and your Karl Iv\u00e1nich!\u201d He took the glass with the drops and again went up to the cot.\n\n\u201cAndrew, don\u2019t!\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nBut he scowled at her angrily though also with suffering in his eyes, and stooped glass in hand over the infant.\n\n\u201cBut I wish it,\u201d he said. \u201cI beg you\u2014give it him!\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary shrugged her shoulders but took the glass submissively and calling the nurse began giving the medicine. The child screamed hoarsely. Prince Andrew winced and, clutching his head, went out and sat down on a sofa in the next room.\n\nHe still had all the letters in his hand. Opening them mechanically he began reading. The old prince, now and then using abbreviations, wrote in his large elongated hand on blue paper as follows:\n\nHave just this moment received by special messenger very joyful news\u2014if it\u2019s not false. Bennigsen seems to have obtained a complete victory over Buonaparte at Eylau. In Petersburg everyone is rejoicing, and the rewards sent to the army are innumerable. Though he is a German\u2014I congratulate him! I can\u2019t make out what the commander at K\u00f3rchevo\u2014a certain Khandrik\u00f3v\u2014is up to; till now the additional men and provisions have not arrived. Gallop off to him at once and say I\u2019ll have his head off if everything is not here in a week. Have received another letter about the Preussisch-Eylau battle from P\u00e9tenka\u2014he took part in it\u2014and it\u2019s all true. When mischief-makers don\u2019t meddle even a German beats Buonaparte. He is said to be fleeing in great disorder. Mind you gallop off to K\u00f3rchevo without delay and carry out instructions!\n\nPrince Andrew sighed and broke the seal of another envelope. It was a closely written letter of two sheets from Bil\u00edbin. He folded it up without reading it and reread his father\u2019s letter, ending with the words: \u201cGallop off to K\u00f3rchevo and carry out instructions!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, pardon me, I won\u2019t go now till the child is better,\u201d thought he, going to the door and looking into the nursery.\n\nPrincess Mary was still standing by the cot, gently rocking the baby.\n\n\u201cAh yes, and what else did he say that\u2019s unpleasant?\u201d thought Prince Andrew, recalling his father\u2019s letter. \u201cYes, we have gained a victory over Bonaparte, just when I\u2019m not serving. Yes, yes, he\u2019s always poking fun at me.... Ah, well! Let him!\u201d And he began reading Bil\u00edbin\u2019s letter which was written in French. He read without understanding half of it, read only to forget, if but for a moment, what he had too long been thinking of so painfully to the exclusion of all else.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nBil\u00edbin was now at army headquarters in a diplomatic capacity, and though he wrote in French and used French jests and French idioms, he described the whole campaign with a fearless self-censure and self-derision genuinely Russian. Bil\u00edbin wrote that the obligation of diplomatic discretion tormented him, and he was happy to have in Prince Andrew a reliable correspondent to whom he could pour out the bile he had accumulated at the sight of all that was being done in the army. The letter was old, having been written before the battle at Preussisch-Eylau.\n\n\u201cSince the day of our brilliant success at Austerlitz,\u201d wrote Bil\u00edbin, \u201cas you know, my dear prince, I never leave headquarters. I have certainly acquired a taste for war, and it is just as well for me; what I have seen during these last three months is incredible.\n\n\u201cI begin ab ovo. \u2018The enemy of the human race,\u2019 as you know, attacks the Prussians. The Prussians are our faithful allies who have only betrayed us three times in three years. We take up their cause, but it turns out that \u2018the enemy of the human race\u2019 pays no heed to our fine speeches and in his rude and savage way throws himself on the Prussians without giving them time to finish the parade they had begun, and in two twists of the hand he breaks them to smithereens and installs himself in the palace at Potsdam.\n\n\u201c\u2018I most ardently desire,\u2019 writes the King of Prussia to Bonaparte, \u2018that Your Majesty should be received and treated in my palace in a manner agreeable to yourself, and in so far as circumstances allowed, I have hastened to take all steps to that end. May I have succeeded!\u2019 The Prussian generals pride themselves on being polite to the French and lay down their arms at the first demand.\n\n\u201cThe head of the garrison at Glogau, with ten thousand men, asks the King of Prussia what he is to do if he is summoned to surrender.... All this is absolutely true.\n\n\u201cIn short, hoping to settle matters by taking up a warlike attitude, it turns out that we have landed ourselves in war, and what is more, in war on our own frontiers, with and for the King of Prussia. We have everything in perfect order, only one little thing is lacking, namely, a commander in chief. As it was considered that the Austerlitz success might have been more decisive had the commander in chief not been so young, all our octogenarians were reviewed, and of Prozor\u00f3vski and K\u00e1menski the latter was preferred. The general comes to us, Suv\u00f3rov-like, in a kib\u00edtka, and is received with acclamations of joy and triumph.\n\n\u201cOn the 4th, the first courier arrives from Petersburg. The mails are taken to the field marshal\u2019s room, for he likes to do everything himself. I am called in to help sort the letters and take those meant for us. The field marshal looks on and waits for letters addressed to him. We search, but none are to be found. The field marshal grows impatient and sets to work himself and finds letters from the Emperor to Count T., Prince V., and others. Then he bursts into one of his wild furies and rages at everyone and everything, seizes the letters, opens them, and reads those from the Emperor addressed to others. \u2018Ah! So that\u2019s the way they treat me! No confidence in me! Ah, ordered to keep an eye on me! Very well then! Get along with you!\u2019 So he writes the famous order of the day to General Bennigsen:\n\n\u201c\u2018I am wounded and cannot ride and consequently cannot command the army. You have brought your army corps to Pult\u00fask, routed: here it is exposed, and without fuel or forage, so something must be done, and, as you yourself reported to Count Buxh\u00f6wden yesterday, you must think of retreating to our frontier\u2014which do today.\u2019\n\n\u201c\u2018From all my riding,\u2019 he writes to the Emperor, \u2018I have got a saddle sore which, coming after all my previous journeys, quite prevents my riding and commanding so vast an army, so I have passed on the command to the general next in seniority, Count Buxh\u00f6wden, having sent him my whole staff and all that belongs to it, advising him if there is a lack of bread, to move farther into the interior of Prussia, for only one day\u2019s ration of bread remains, and in some regiments none at all, as reported by the division commanders, Ostermann and Sedmor\u00e9tzki, and all that the peasants had has been eaten up. I myself will remain in hospital at Ostrolenka till I recover. In regard to which I humbly submit my report, with the information that if the army remains in its present bivouac another fortnight there will not be a healthy man left in it by spring.\n\n\u201c\u2018Grant leave to retire to his country seat to an old man who is already in any case dishonored by being unable to fulfill the great and glorious task for which he was chosen. I shall await your most gracious permission here in hospital, that I may not have to play the part of a secretary rather than commander in the army. My removal from the army does not produce the slightest stir\u2014a blind man has left it. There are thousands such as I in Russia.\u2019\n\n\u201cThe field marshal is angry with the Emperor and he punishes us all, isn\u2019t it logical?\n\n\u201cThis is the first act. Those that follow are naturally increasingly interesting and entertaining. After the field marshal\u2019s departure it appears that we are within sight of the enemy and must give battle. Buxh\u00f6wden is commander in chief by seniority, but General Bennigsen does not quite see it; more particularly as it is he and his corps who are within sight of the enemy and he wishes to profit by the opportunity to fight a battle \u2018on his own hand\u2019 as the Germans say. He does so. This is the battle of Pult\u00fask, which is considered a great victory but in my opinion was nothing of the kind. We civilians, as you know, have a very bad way of deciding whether a battle was won or lost. Those who retreat after a battle have lost it is what we say; and according to that it is we who lost the battle of Pult\u00fask. In short, we retreat after the battle but send a courier to Petersburg with news of a victory, and General Bennigsen, hoping to receive from Petersburg the post of commander in chief as a reward for his victory, does not give up the command of the army to General Buxh\u00f6wden. During this interregnum we begin a very original and interesting series of maneuvers. Our aim is no longer, as it should be, to avoid or attack the enemy, but solely to avoid General Buxh\u00f6wden who by right of seniority should be our chief. So energetically do we pursue this aim that after crossing an unfordable river we burn the bridges to separate ourselves from our enemy, who at the moment is not Bonaparte but Buxh\u00f6wden. General Buxh\u00f6wden was all but attacked and captured by a superior enemy force as a result of one of these maneuvers that enabled us to escape him. Buxh\u00f6wden pursues us\u2014we scuttle. He hardly crosses the river to our side before we recross to the other. At last our enemy, Buxh\u00f6wden, catches us and attacks. Both generals are angry, and the result is a challenge on Buxh\u00f6wden\u2019s part and an epileptic fit on Bennigsen\u2019s. But at the critical moment the courier who carried the news of our victory at Pult\u00fask to Petersburg returns bringing our appointment as commander in chief, and our first foe, Buxh\u00f6wden, is vanquished; we can now turn our thoughts to the second, Bonaparte. But as it turns out, just at that moment a third enemy rises before us\u2014namely the Orthodox Russian soldiers, loudly demanding bread, meat, biscuits, fodder, and whatnot! The stores are empty, the roads impassable. The Orthodox begin looting, and in a way of which our last campaign can give you no idea. Half the regiments form bands and scour the countryside and put everything to fire and sword. The inhabitants are totally ruined, the hospitals overflow with sick, and famine is everywhere. Twice the marauders even attack our headquarters, and the commander in chief has to ask for a battalion to disperse them. During one of these attacks they carried off my empty portmanteau and my dressing gown. The Emperor proposes to give all commanders of divisions the right to shoot marauders, but I much fear this will oblige one half the army to shoot the other.\u201d\n\nAt first Prince Andrew read with his eyes only, but after a while, in spite of himself (although he knew how far it was safe to trust Bil\u00edbin), what he had read began to interest him more and more. When he had read thus far, he crumpled the letter up and threw it away. It was not what he had read that vexed him, but the fact that the life out there in which he had now no part could perturb him. He shut his eyes, rubbed his forehead as if to rid himself of all interest in what he had read, and listened to what was passing in the nursery. Suddenly he thought he heard a strange noise through the door. He was seized with alarm lest something should have happened to the child while he was reading the letter. He went on tiptoe to the nursery door and opened it.\n\nJust as he went in he saw that the nurse was hiding something from him with a scared look and that Princess Mary was no longer by the cot.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d he heard what seemed to him her despairing whisper behind him.\n\nAs often happens after long sleeplessness and long anxiety, he was seized by an unreasoning panic\u2014it occurred to him that the child was dead. All that he saw and heard seemed to confirm this terror.\n\n\u201cAll is over,\u201d he thought, and a cold sweat broke out on his forehead. He went to the cot in confusion, sure that he would find it empty and that the nurse had been hiding the dead baby. He drew the curtain aside and for some time his frightened, restless eyes could not find the baby. At last he saw him: the rosy boy had tossed about till he lay across the bed with his head lower than the pillow, and was smacking his lips in his sleep and breathing evenly.\n\nPrince Andrew was as glad to find the boy like that, as if he had already lost him. He bent over him and, as his sister had taught him, tried with his lips whether the child was still feverish. The soft forehead was moist. Prince Andrew touched the head with his hand; even the hair was wet, so profusely had the child perspired. He was not dead, but evidently the crisis was over and he was convalescent. Prince Andrew longed to snatch up, to squeeze, to hold to his heart, this helpless little creature, but dared not do so. He stood over him, gazing at his head and at the little arms and legs which showed under the blanket. He heard a rustle behind him and a shadow appeared under the curtain of the cot. He did not look round, but still gazing at the infant\u2019s face listened to his regular breathing. The dark shadow was Princess Mary, who had come up to the cot with noiseless steps, lifted the curtain, and dropped it again behind her. Prince Andrew recognized her without looking and held out his hand to her. She pressed it.\n\n\u201cHe has perspired,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cI was coming to tell you so.\u201d\n\nThe child moved slightly in his sleep, smiled, and rubbed his forehead against the pillow.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at his sister. In the dim shadow of the curtain her luminous eyes shone more brightly than usual from the tears of joy that were in them. She leaned over to her brother and kissed him, slightly catching the curtain of the cot. Each made the other a warning gesture and stood still in the dim light beneath the curtain as if not wishing to leave that seclusion where they three were shut off from all the world. Prince Andrew was the first to move away, ruffling his hair against the muslin of the curtain.\n\n\u201cYes, this is the one thing left me now,\u201d he said with a sigh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nSoon after his admission to the Masonic Brotherhood, Pierre went to the Kiev province, where he had the greatest number of serfs, taking with him full directions which he had written down for his own guidance as to what he should do on his estates.\n\nWhen he reached Kiev he sent for all his stewards to the head office and explained to them his intentions and wishes. He told them that steps would be taken immediately to free his serfs\u2014and that till then they were not to be overburdened with labor, women while nursing their babies were not to be sent to work, assistance was to be given to the serfs, punishments were to be admonitory and not corporal, and hospitals, asylums, and schools were to be established on all the estates. Some of the stewards (there were semiliterate foremen among them) listened with alarm, supposing these words to mean that the young count was displeased with their management and embezzlement of money, some after their first fright were amused by Pierre\u2019s lisp and the new words they had not heard before, others simply enjoyed hearing how the master talked, while the cleverest among them, including the chief steward, understood from this speech how they could best handle the master for their own ends.\n\nThe chief steward expressed great sympathy with Pierre\u2019s intentions, but remarked that besides these changes it would be necessary to go into the general state of affairs which was far from satisfactory.\n\nDespite Count Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s enormous wealth, since he had come into an income which was said to amount to five hundred thousand rubles a year, Pierre felt himself far poorer than when his father had made him an allowance of ten thousand rubles. He had a dim perception of the following budget:\n\nAbout 80,000 went in payments on all the estates to the Land Bank, about 30,000 went for the upkeep of the estate near Moscow, the town house, and the allowance to the three princesses; about 15,000 was given in pensions and the same amount for asylums; 150,000 alimony was sent to the countess; about 70,000 went for interest on debts. The building of a new church, previously begun, had cost about 10,000 in each of the last two years, and he did not know how the rest, about 100,000 rubles, was spent, and almost every year he was obliged to borrow. Besides this the chief steward wrote every year telling him of fires and bad harvests, or of the necessity of rebuilding factories and workshops. So the first task Pierre had to face was one for which he had very little aptitude or inclination\u2014practical business.\n\nHe discussed estate affairs every day with his chief steward. But he felt that this did not forward matters at all. He felt that these consultations were detached from real affairs and did not link up with them or make them move. On the one hand, the chief steward put the state of things to him in the very worst light, pointing out the necessity of paying off the debts and undertaking new activities with serf labor, to which Pierre did not agree. On the other hand, Pierre demanded that steps should be taken to liberate the serfs, which the steward met by showing the necessity of first paying off the loans from the Land Bank, and the consequent impossibility of a speedy emancipation.\n\nThe steward did not say it was quite impossible, but suggested selling the forests in the province of Kostrom\u00e1, the land lower down the river, and the Crimean estate, in order to make it possible: all of which operations according to him were connected with such complicated measures\u2014the removal of injunctions, petitions, permits, and so on\u2014that Pierre became quite bewildered and only replied:\n\n\u201cYes, yes, do so.\u201d\n\nPierre had none of the practical persistence that would have enabled him to attend to the business himself and so he disliked it and only tried to pretend to the steward that he was attending to it. The steward for his part tried to pretend to the count that he considered these consultations very valuable for the proprietor and troublesome to himself.\n\nIn Kiev Pierre found some people he knew, and strangers hastened to make his acquaintance and joyfully welcomed the rich newcomer, the largest landowner of the province. Temptations to Pierre\u2019s greatest weakness\u2014the one to which he had confessed when admitted to the Lodge\u2014were so strong that he could not resist them. Again whole days, weeks, and months of his life passed in as great a rush and were as much occupied with evening parties, dinners, lunches, and balls, giving him no time for reflection, as in Petersburg. Instead of the new life he had hoped to lead he still lived the old life, only in new surroundings.\n\nOf the three precepts of Freemasonry Pierre realized that he did not fulfill the one which enjoined every Mason to set an example of moral life, and that of the seven virtues he lacked two\u2014morality and the love of death. He consoled himself with the thought that he fulfilled another of the precepts\u2014that of reforming the human race\u2014and had other virtues\u2014love of his neighbor, and especially generosity.\n\nIn the spring of 1807 he decided to return to Petersburg. On the way he intended to visit all his estates and see for himself how far his orders had been carried out and in what state were the serfs whom God had entrusted to his care and whom he intended to benefit.\n\nThe chief steward, who considered the young count\u2019s attempts almost insane\u2014unprofitable to himself, to the count, and to the serfs\u2014made some concessions. Continuing to represent the liberation of the serfs as impracticable, he arranged for the erection of large buildings\u2014schools, hospitals, and asylums\u2014on all the estates before the master arrived. Everywhere preparations were made not for ceremonious welcomes (which he knew Pierre would not like), but for just such gratefully religious ones, with offerings of icons and the bread and salt of hospitality, as, according to his understanding of his master, would touch and delude him.\n\nThe southern spring, the comfortable rapid traveling in a Vienna carriage, and the solitude of the road, all had a gladdening effect on Pierre. The estates he had not before visited were each more picturesque than the other; the serfs everywhere seemed thriving and touchingly grateful for the benefits conferred on them. Everywhere were receptions, which though they embarrassed Pierre awakened a joyful feeling in the depth of his heart. In one place the peasants presented him with bread and salt and an icon of Saint Peter and Saint Paul, asking permission, as a mark of their gratitude for the benefits he had conferred on them, to build a new chantry to the church at their own expense in honor of Peter and Paul, his patron saints. In another place the women with infants in arms met him to thank him for releasing them from hard work. On a third estate the priest, bearing a cross, came to meet him surrounded by children whom, by the count\u2019s generosity, he was instructing in reading, writing, and religion. On all his estates Pierre saw with his own eyes brick buildings erected or in course of erection, all on one plan, for hospitals, schools, and almshouses, which were soon to be opened. Everywhere he saw the stewards\u2019 accounts, according to which the serfs\u2019 manorial labor had been diminished, and heard the touching thanks of deputations of serfs in their full-skirted blue coats.\n\nWhat Pierre did not know was that the place where they presented him with bread and salt and wished to build a chantry in honor of Peter and Paul was a market village where a fair was held on St. Peter\u2019s day, and that the richest peasants (who formed the deputation) had begun the chantry long before, but that nine tenths of the peasants in that villages were in a state of the greatest poverty. He did not know that since the nursing mothers were no longer sent to work on his land, they did still harder work on their own land. He did not know that the priest who met him with the cross oppressed the peasants by his exactions, and that the pupils\u2019 parents wept at having to let him take their children and secured their release by heavy payments. He did not know that the brick buildings, built to plan, were being built by serfs whose manorial labor was thus increased, though lessened on paper. He did not know that where the steward had shown him in the accounts that the serfs\u2019 payments had been diminished by a third, their obligatory manorial work had been increased by a half. And so Pierre was delighted with his visit to his estates and quite recovered the philanthropic mood in which he had left Petersburg, and wrote enthusiastic letters to his \u201cbrother-instructor\u201d as he called the Grand Master.\n\n\u201cHow easy it is, how little effort it needs, to do so much good,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cand how little attention we pay to it!\u201d\n\nHe was pleased at the gratitude he received, but felt abashed at receiving it. This gratitude reminded him of how much more he might do for these simple, kindly people.\n\nThe chief steward, a very stupid but cunning man who saw perfectly through the na\u00efve and intelligent count and played with him as with a toy, seeing the effect these prearranged receptions had on Pierre, pressed him still harder with proofs of the impossibility and above all the uselessness of freeing the serfs, who were quite happy as it was.\n\nPierre in his secret soul agreed with the steward that it would be difficult to imagine happier people, and that God only knew what would happen to them when they were free, but he insisted, though reluctantly, on what he thought right. The steward promised to do all in his power to carry out the count\u2019s wishes, seeing clearly that not only would the count never be able to find out whether all measures had been taken for the sale of the land and forests and to release them from the Land Bank, but would probably never even inquire and would never know that the newly erected buildings were standing empty and that the serfs continued to give in money and work all that other people\u2019s serfs gave\u2014that is to say, all that could be got out of them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\n\nReturning from his journey through South Russia in the happiest state of mind, Pierre carried out an intention he had long had of visiting his friend Bolk\u00f3nski, whom he had not seen for two years.\n\nBoguch\u00e1rovo lay in a flat uninteresting part of the country among fields and forests of fir and birch, which were partly cut down. The house lay behind a newly dug pond filled with water to the brink and with banks still bare of grass. It was at the end of a village that stretched along the highroad in the midst of a young copse in which were a few fir trees.\n\nThe homestead consisted of a threshing floor, outhouses, stables, a bathhouse, a lodge, and a large brick house with semicircular fa\u00e7ade still in course of construction. Round the house was a garden newly laid out. The fences and gates were new and solid; two fire pumps and a water cart, painted green, stood in a shed; the paths were straight, the bridges were strong and had handrails. Everything bore an impress of tidiness and good management. Some domestic serfs Pierre met, in reply to inquiries as to where the prince lived, pointed out a small newly built lodge close to the pond. Ant\u00f3n, a man who had looked after Prince Andrew in his boyhood, helped Pierre out of his carriage, said that the prince was at home, and showed him into a clean little anteroom.\n\nPierre was struck by the modesty of the small though clean house after the brilliant surroundings in which he had last met his friend in Petersburg.\n\nHe quickly entered the small reception room with its still-unplastered wooden walls redolent of pine, and would have gone farther, but Ant\u00f3n ran ahead on tiptoe and knocked at a door.\n\n\u201cWell, what is it?\u201d came a sharp, unpleasant voice.\n\n\u201cA visitor,\u201d answered Ant\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cAsk him to wait,\u201d and the sound was heard of a chair being pushed back.\n\nPierre went with rapid steps to the door and suddenly came face to face with Prince Andrew, who came out frowning and looking old. Pierre embraced him and lifting his spectacles kissed his friend on the cheek and looked at him closely.\n\n\u201cWell, I did not expect you, I am very glad,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre said nothing; he looked fixedly at his friend with surprise. He was struck by the change in him. His words were kindly and there was a smile on his lips and face, but his eyes were dull and lifeless and in spite of his evident wish to do so he could not give them a joyous and glad sparkle. Prince Andrew had grown thinner, paler, and more manly-looking, but what amazed and estranged Pierre till he got used to it were his inertia and a wrinkle on his brow indicating prolonged concentration on some one thought.\n\nAs is usually the case with people meeting after a prolonged separation, it was long before their conversation could settle on anything. They put questions and gave brief replies about things they knew ought to be talked over at length. At last the conversation gradually settled on some of the topics at first lightly touched on: their past life, plans for the future, Pierre\u2019s journeys and occupations, the war, and so on. The preoccupation and despondency which Pierre had noticed in his friend\u2019s look was now still more clearly expressed in the smile with which he listened to Pierre, especially when he spoke with joyful animation of the past or the future. It was as if Prince Andrew would have liked to sympathize with what Pierre was saying, but could not. The latter began to feel that it was in bad taste to speak of his enthusiasms, dreams, and hopes of happiness or goodness, in Prince Andrew\u2019s presence. He was ashamed to express his new Masonic views, which had been particularly revived and strengthened by his late tour. He checked himself, fearing to seem na\u00efve, yet he felt an irresistible desire to show his friend as soon as possible that he was now a quite different, and better, Pierre than he had been in Petersburg.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how much I have lived through since then. I hardly know myself again.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we have altered much, very much, since then,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWell, and you? What are your plans?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlans!\u201d repeated Prince Andrew ironically. \u201cMy plans?\u201d he said, as if astonished at the word. \u201cWell, you see, I\u2019m building. I mean to settle here altogether next year....\u201d\n\nPierre looked silently and searchingly into Prince Andrew\u2019s face, which had grown much older.\n\n\u201cNo, I meant to ask...\u201d Pierre began, but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n\n\u201cBut why talk of me?... Talk to me, yes, tell me about your travels and all you have been doing on your estates.\u201d\n\nPierre began describing what he had done on his estates, trying as far as possible to conceal his own part in the improvements that had been made. Prince Andrew several times prompted Pierre\u2019s story of what he had been doing, as though it were all an old-time story, and he listened not only without interest but even as if ashamed of what Pierre was telling him.\n\nPierre felt uncomfortable and even depressed in his friend\u2019s company and at last became silent.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, my dear fellow,\u201d said Prince Andrew, who evidently also felt depressed and constrained with his visitor, \u201cI am only bivouacking here and have just come to look round. I am going back to my sister today. I will introduce you to her. But of course you know her already,\u201d he said, evidently trying to entertain a visitor with whom he now found nothing in common. \u201cWe will go after dinner. And would you now like to look round my place?\u201d\n\nThey went out and walked about till dinnertime, talking of the political news and common acquaintances like people who do not know each other intimately. Prince Andrew spoke with some animation and interest only of the new homestead he was constructing and its buildings, but even here, while on the scaffolding, in the midst of a talk explaining the future arrangements of the house, he interrupted himself:\n\n\u201cHowever, this is not at all interesting. Let us have dinner, and then we\u2019ll set off.\u201d\n\nAt dinner, conversation turned on Pierre\u2019s marriage.\n\n\u201cI was very much surprised when I heard of it,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\nPierre blushed, as he always did when it was mentioned, and said hurriedly: \u201cI will tell you some time how it all happened. But you know it is all over, and forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cForever?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cNothing\u2019s forever.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you know how it all ended, don\u2019t you? You heard of the duel?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd so you had to go through that too!\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing I thank God for is that I did not kill that man,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Prince Andrew. \u201cTo kill a vicious dog is a very good thing really.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, to kill a man is bad\u2014wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it wrong?\u201d urged Prince Andrew. \u201cIt is not given to man to know what is right and what is wrong. Men always did and always will err, and in nothing more than in what they consider right and wrong.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat does harm to another is wrong,\u201d said Pierre, feeling with pleasure that for the first time since his arrival Prince Andrew was roused, had begun to talk, and wanted to express what had brought him to his present state.\n\n\u201cAnd who has told you what is bad for another man?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cBad! Bad!\u201d exclaimed Pierre. \u201cWe all know what is bad for ourselves.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we know that, but the harm I am conscious of in myself is something I cannot inflict on others,\u201d said Prince Andrew, growing more and more animated and evidently wishing to express his new outlook to Pierre. He spoke in French. \u201cI only know two very real evils in life: remorse and illness. The only good is the absence of those evils. To live for myself avoiding those two evils is my whole philosophy now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd love of one\u2019s neighbor, and self-sacrifice?\u201d began Pierre. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t agree with you! To live only so as not to do evil and not to have to repent is not enough. I lived like that, I lived for myself and ruined my life. And only now when I am living, or at least trying\u201d (Pierre\u2019s modesty made him correct himself) \u201cto live for others, only now have I understood all the happiness of life. No, I shall not agree with you, and you do not really believe what you are saying.\u201d Prince Andrew looked silently at Pierre with an ironic smile.\n\n\u201cWhen you see my sister, Princess Mary, you\u2019ll get on with her,\u201d he said. \u201cPerhaps you are right for yourself,\u201d he added after a short pause, \u201cbut everyone lives in his own way. You lived for yourself and say you nearly ruined your life and only found happiness when you began living for others. I experienced just the reverse. I lived for glory.\u2014And after all what is glory? The same love of others, a desire to do something for them, a desire for their approval.\u2014So I lived for others, and not almost, but quite, ruined my life. And I have become calmer since I began to live only for myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what do you mean by living only for yourself?\u201d asked Pierre, growing excited. \u201cWhat about your son, your sister, and your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s just the same as myself\u2014they are not others,\u201d explained Prince Andrew. \u201cThe others, one\u2019s neighbors, le prochain, as you and Princess Mary call it, are the chief source of all error and evil. Le prochain\u2014your Kiev peasants to whom you want to do good.\u201d\n\nAnd he looked at Pierre with a mocking, challenging expression. He evidently wished to draw him on.\n\n\u201cYou are joking,\u201d replied Pierre, growing more and more excited. \u201cWhat error or evil can there be in my wishing to do good, and even doing a little\u2014though I did very little and did it very badly? What evil can there be in it if unfortunate people, our serfs, people like ourselves, were growing up and dying with no idea of God and truth beyond ceremonies and meaningless prayers and are now instructed in a comforting belief in future life, retribution, recompense, and consolation? What evil and error are there in it, if people were dying of disease without help while material assistance could so easily be rendered, and I supplied them with a doctor, a hospital, and an asylum for the aged? And is it not a palpable, unquestionable good if a peasant, or a woman with a baby, has no rest day or night and I give them rest and leisure?\u201d said Pierre, hurrying and lisping. \u201cAnd I have done that though badly and to a small extent; but I have done something toward it and you cannot persuade me that it was not a good action, and more than that, you can\u2019t make me believe that you do not think so yourself. And the main thing is,\u201d he continued, \u201cthat I know, and know for certain, that the enjoyment of doing this good is the only sure happiness in life.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, if you put it like that it\u2019s quite a different matter,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cI build a house and lay out a garden, and you build hospitals. The one and the other may serve as a pastime. But what\u2019s right and what\u2019s good must be judged by one who knows all, but not by us. Well, you want an argument,\u201d he added, \u201ccome on then.\u201d\n\nThey rose from the table and sat down in the entrance porch which served as a veranda.\n\n\u201cCome, let\u2019s argue then,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cYou talk of schools,\u201d he went on, crooking a finger, \u201ceducation and so forth; that is, you want to raise him\u201d (pointing to a peasant who passed by them taking off his cap) \u201cfrom his animal condition and awaken in him spiritual needs, while it seems to me that animal happiness is the only happiness possible, and that is just what you want to deprive him of. I envy him, but you want to make him what I am, without giving him my means. Then you say, \u2018lighten his toil.\u2019 But as I see it, physical labor is as essential to him, as much a condition of his existence, as mental activity is to you or me. You can\u2019t help thinking. I go to bed after two in the morning, thoughts come and I can\u2019t sleep but toss about till dawn, because I think and can\u2019t help thinking, just as he can\u2019t help plowing and mowing; if he didn\u2019t, he would go to the drink shop or fall ill. Just as I could not stand his terrible physical labor but should die of it in a week, so he could not stand my physical idleness, but would grow fat and die. The third thing\u2014what else was it you talked about?\u201d and Prince Andrew crooked a third finger. \u201cAh, yes, hospitals, medicine. He has a fit, he is dying, and you come and bleed him and patch him up. He will drag about as a cripple, a burden to everybody, for another ten years. It would be far easier and simpler for him to die. Others are being born and there are plenty of them as it is. It would be different if you grudged losing a laborer\u2014that\u2019s how I regard him\u2014but you want to cure him from love of him. And he does not want that. And besides, what a notion that medicine ever cured anyone! Killed them, yes!\u201d said he, frowning angrily and turning away from Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew expressed his ideas so clearly and distinctly that it was evident he had reflected on this subject more than once, and he spoke readily and rapidly like a man who has not talked for a long time. His glance became more animated as his conclusions became more hopeless.\n\n\u201cOh, that is dreadful, dreadful!\u201d said Pierre. \u201cI don\u2019t understand how one can live with such ideas. I had such moments myself not long ago, in Moscow and when traveling, but at such times I collapsed so that I don\u2019t live at all\u2014everything seems hateful to me... myself most of all. Then I don\u2019t eat, don\u2019t wash... and how is it with you?...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not wash? That is not cleanly,\u201d said Prince Andrew; \u201con the contrary one must try to make one\u2019s life as pleasant as possible. I\u2019m alive, that is not my fault, so I must live out my life as best I can without hurting others.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut with such ideas what motive have you for living? One would sit without moving, undertaking nothing....\u201d\n\n\u201cLife as it is leaves one no peace. I should be thankful to do nothing, but here on the one hand the local nobility have done me the honor to choose me to be their marshal; it was all I could do to get out of it. They could not understand that I have not the necessary qualifications for it\u2014the kind of good-natured, fussy shallowness necessary for the position. Then there\u2019s this house, which must be built in order to have a nook of one\u2019s own in which to be quiet. And now there\u2019s this recruiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you serving in the army?\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter Austerlitz!\u201d said Prince Andrew gloomily. \u201cNo, thank you very much! I have promised myself not to serve again in the active Russian army. And I won\u2019t\u2014not even if Bonaparte were here at Smol\u00e9nsk threatening Bald Hills\u2014even then I wouldn\u2019t serve in the Russian army! Well, as I was saying,\u201d he continued, recovering his composure, \u201cnow there\u2019s this recruiting. My father is chief in command of the Third District, and my only way of avoiding active service is to serve under him.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen you are serving?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am.\u201d\n\nHe paused a little while.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you serve?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, for this reason! My father is one of the most remarkable men of his time. But he is growing old, and though not exactly cruel he has too energetic a character. He is so accustomed to unlimited power that he is terrible, and now he has this authority of a commander in chief of the recruiting, granted by the Emperor. If I had been two hours late a fortnight ago he would have had a paymaster\u2019s clerk at Y\u00fakhnovna hanged,\u201d said Prince Andrew with a smile. \u201cSo I am serving because I alone have any influence with my father, and now and then can save him from actions which would torment him afterwards.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, there you see!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but it is not as you imagine,\u201d Prince Andrew continued. \u201cI did not, and do not, in the least care about that scoundrel of a clerk who had stolen some boots from the recruits; I should even have been very glad to see him hanged, but I was sorry for my father\u2014that again is for myself.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew grew more and more animated. His eyes glittered feverishly while he tried to prove to Pierre that in his actions there was no desire to do good to his neighbor.\n\n\u201cThere now, you wish to liberate your serfs,\u201d he continued; \u201cthat is a very good thing, but not for you\u2014I don\u2019t suppose you ever had anyone flogged or sent to Siberia\u2014and still less for your serfs. If they are beaten, flogged, or sent to Siberia, I don\u2019t suppose they are any the worse off. In Siberia they lead the same animal life, and the stripes on their bodies heal, and they are happy as before. But it is a good thing for proprietors who perish morally, bring remorse upon themselves, stifle this remorse and grow callous, as a result of being able to inflict punishments justly and unjustly. It is those people I pity, and for their sake I should like to liberate the serfs. You may not have seen, but I have seen, how good men brought up in those traditions of unlimited power, in time when they grow more irritable, become cruel and harsh, are conscious of it, but cannot restrain themselves and grow more and more miserable.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew spoke so earnestly that Pierre could not help thinking that these thoughts had been suggested to Prince Andrew by his father\u2019s case.\n\nHe did not reply.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what I\u2019m sorry for\u2014human dignity, peace of mind, purity, and not the serfs\u2019 backs and foreheads, which, beat and shave as you may, always remain the same backs and foreheads.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no! A thousand times no! I shall never agree with you,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nIn the evening Andrew and Pierre got into the open carriage and drove to Bald Hills. Prince Andrew, glancing at Pierre, broke the silence now and then with remarks which showed that he was in a good temper.\n\nPointing to the fields, he spoke of the improvements he was making in his husbandry.\n\nPierre remained gloomily silent, answering in monosyllables and apparently immersed in his own thoughts.\n\nHe was thinking that Prince Andrew was unhappy, had gone astray, did not see the true light, and that he, Pierre, ought to aid, enlighten, and raise him. But as soon as he thought of what he should say, he felt that Prince Andrew with one word, one argument, would upset all his teaching, and he shrank from beginning, afraid of exposing to possible ridicule what to him was precious and sacred.\n\n\u201cNo, but why do you think so?\u201d Pierre suddenly began, lowering his head and looking like a bull about to charge, \u201cwhy do you think so? You should not think so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThink? What about?\u201d asked Prince Andrew with surprise.\n\n\u201cAbout life, about man\u2019s destiny. It can\u2019t be so. I myself thought like that, and do you know what saved me? Freemasonry! No, don\u2019t smile. Freemasonry is not a religious ceremonial sect, as I thought it was: Freemasonry is the best expression of the best, the eternal, aspects of humanity.\u201d\n\nAnd he began to explain Freemasonry as he understood it to Prince Andrew. He said that Freemasonry is the teaching of Christianity freed from the bonds of State and Church, a teaching of equality, brotherhood, and love.\n\n\u201cOnly our holy brotherhood has the real meaning of life, all the rest is a dream,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cUnderstand, my dear fellow, that outside this union all is filled with deceit and falsehood and I agree with you that nothing is left for an intelligent and good man but to live out his life, like you, merely trying not to harm others. But make our fundamental convictions your own, join our brotherhood, give yourself up to us, let yourself be guided, and you will at once feel yourself, as I have felt myself, a part of that vast invisible chain the beginning of which is hidden in heaven,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew, looking straight in front of him, listened in silence to Pierre\u2019s words. More than once, when the noise of the wheels prevented his catching what Pierre said, he asked him to repeat it, and by the peculiar glow that came into Prince Andrew\u2019s eyes and by his silence, Pierre saw that his words were not in vain and that Prince Andrew would not interrupt him or laugh at what he said.\n\nThey reached a river that had overflowed its banks and which they had to cross by ferry. While the carriage and horses were being placed on it, they also stepped on the raft.\n\nPrince Andrew, leaning his arms on the raft railing, gazed silently at the flooding waters glittering in the setting sun.\n\n\u201cWell, what do you think about it?\u201d Pierre asked. \u201cWhy are you silent?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat do I think about it? I am listening to you. It\u2019s all very well.... You say: join our brotherhood and we will show you the aim of life, the destiny of man, and the laws which govern the world. But who are we? Men. How is it you know everything? Why do I alone not see what you see? You see a reign of goodness and truth on earth, but I don\u2019t see it.\u201d\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\u201cDo you believe in a future life?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cA future life?\u201d Prince Andrew repeated, but Pierre, giving him no time to reply, took the repetition for a denial, the more readily as he knew Prince Andrew\u2019s former atheistic convictions.\n\n\u201cYou say you can\u2019t see a reign of goodness and truth on earth. Nor could I, and it cannot be seen if one looks on our life here as the end of everything. On earth, here on this earth\u201d (Pierre pointed to the fields), \u201cthere is no truth, all is false and evil; but in the universe, in the whole universe there is a kingdom of truth, and we who are now the children of earth are\u2014eternally\u2014children of the whole universe. Don\u2019t I feel in my soul that I am part of this vast harmonious whole? Don\u2019t I feel that I form one link, one step, between the lower and higher beings, in this vast harmonious multitude of beings in whom the Deity\u2014the Supreme Power if you prefer the term\u2014is manifest? If I see, clearly see, that ladder leading from plant to man, why should I suppose it breaks off at me and does not go farther and farther? I feel that I cannot vanish, since nothing vanishes in this world, but that I shall always exist and always have existed. I feel that beyond me and above me there are spirits, and that in this world there is truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that is Herder\u2019s theory,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cbut it is not that which can convince me, dear friend\u2014life and death are what convince. What convinces is when one sees a being dear to one, bound up with one\u2019s own life, before whom one was to blame and had hoped to make it right\u201d (Prince Andrew\u2019s voice trembled and he turned away), \u201cand suddenly that being is seized with pain, suffers, and ceases to exist.... Why? It cannot be that there is no answer. And I believe there is.... That\u2019s what convinces, that is what has convinced me,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, of course,\u201d said Pierre, \u201cisn\u2019t that what I\u2019m saying?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. All I say is that it is not argument that convinces me of the necessity of a future life, but this: when you go hand in hand with someone and all at once that person vanishes there, into nowhere, and you yourself are left facing that abyss, and look in. And I have looked in....\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s it then! You know that there is a there and there is a Someone? There is the future life. The Someone is\u2014God.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew did not reply. The carriage and horses had long since been taken off, onto the farther bank, and reharnessed. The sun had sunk half below the horizon and an evening frost was starring the puddles near the ferry, but Pierre and Andrew, to the astonishment of the footmen, coachmen, and ferrymen, still stood on the raft and talked.\n\n\u201cIf there is a God and future life, there is truth and good, and man\u2019s highest happiness consists in striving to attain them. We must live, we must love, and we must believe that we live not only today on this scrap of earth, but have lived and shall live forever, there, in the Whole,\u201d said Pierre, and he pointed to the sky.\n\nPrince Andrew stood leaning on the railing of the raft listening to Pierre, and he gazed with his eyes fixed on the red reflection of the sun gleaming on the blue waters. There was perfect stillness. Pierre became silent. The raft had long since stopped and only the waves of the current beat softly against it below. Prince Andrew felt as if the sound of the waves kept up a refrain to Pierre\u2019s words, whispering:\n\n\u201cIt is true, believe it.\u201d\n\nHe sighed, and glanced with a radiant, childlike, tender look at Pierre\u2019s face, flushed and rapturous, but yet shy before his superior friend.\n\n\u201cYes, if it only were so!\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cHowever, it is time to get on,\u201d he added, and, stepping off the raft, he looked up at the sky to which Pierre had pointed, and for the first time since Austerlitz saw that high, everlasting sky he had seen while lying on that battlefield; and something that had long been slumbering, something that was best within him, suddenly awoke, joyful and youthful, in his soul. It vanished as soon as he returned to the customary conditions of his life, but he knew that this feeling which he did not know how to develop existed within him. His meeting with Pierre formed an epoch in Prince Andrew\u2019s life. Though outwardly he continued to live in the same old way, inwardly he began a new life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIt was getting dusk when Prince Andrew and Pierre drove up to the front entrance of the house at Bald Hills. As they approached the house, Prince Andrew with a smile drew Pierre\u2019s attention to a commotion going on at the back porch.", "sequence": 9}, {"offset": 1000000, "text": " A woman, bent with age, with a wallet on her back, and a short, long-haired, young man in a black garment had rushed back to the gate on seeing the carriage driving up. Two women ran out after them, and all four, looking round at the carriage, ran in dismay up the steps of the back porch.\n\n\u201cThose are Mary\u2019s \u2018God\u2019s folk,\u2019\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cThey have mistaken us for my father. This is the one matter in which she disobeys him. He orders these pilgrims to be driven away, but she receives them.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are \u2018God\u2019s folk\u2019?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew had no time to answer. The servants came out to meet them, and he asked where the old prince was and whether he was expected back soon.\n\nThe old prince had gone to the town and was expected back any minute.\n\nPrince Andrew led Pierre to his own apartments, which were always kept in perfect order and readiness for him in his father\u2019s house; he himself went to the nursery.\n\n\u201cLet us go and see my sister,\u201d he said to Pierre when he returned. \u201cI have not found her yet, she is hiding now, sitting with her \u2018God\u2019s folk.\u2019 It will serve her right, she will be confused, but you will see her \u2018God\u2019s folk.\u2019 It\u2019s really very curious.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are \u2018God\u2019s folk\u2019?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cCome, and you\u2019ll see for yourself.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary really was disconcerted and red patches came on her face when they went in. In her snug room, with lamps burning before the icon stand, a young lad with a long nose and long hair, wearing a monk\u2019s cassock, sat on the sofa beside her, behind a samovar. Near them, in an armchair, sat a thin, shriveled, old woman, with a meek expression on her childlike face.\n\n\u201cAndrew, why didn\u2019t you warn me?\u201d said the princess, with mild reproach, as she stood before her pilgrims like a hen before her chickens.\n\n\u201cCharm\u00e9e de vous voir. Je suis tr\u00e8s contente de vous voir,\u201d she said to Pierre as he kissed her hand. She had known him as a child, and now his friendship with Andrew, his misfortune with his wife, and above all his kindly, simple face disposed her favorably toward him. She looked at him with her beautiful radiant eyes and seemed to say, \u201cI like you very much, but please don\u2019t laugh at my people.\u201d After exchanging the first greetings, they sat down.\n\n\u201cAh, and Iv\u00e1nushka is here too!\u201d said Prince Andrew, glancing with a smile at the young pilgrim.\n\n\u201cAndrew!\u201d said Princess Mary, imploringly. \u201cIl faut que vous sachiez que c\u2019est une femme,\u201d said Prince Andrew to Pierre.\n\n\u201cAndrew, au nom de Dieu!\u201d Princess Mary repeated.\n\nIt was evident that Prince Andrew\u2019s ironical tone toward the pilgrims and Princess Mary\u2019s helpless attempts to protect them were their customary long-established relations on the matter.\n\n\u201cMais, ma bonne amie,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cvous devriez au contraire m\u2019\u00eatre reconnaissante de ce que j\u2019explique \u00e0 Pierre votre intimit\u00e9 avec ce jeune homme.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Pierre, gazing over his spectacles with curiosity and seriousness (for which Princess Mary was specially grateful to him) into Iv\u00e1nushka\u2019s face, who, seeing that she was being spoken about, looked round at them all with crafty eyes.\n\nPrincess Mary\u2019s embarrassment on her people\u2019s account was quite unnecessary. They were not in the least abashed. The old woman, lowering her eyes but casting side glances at the newcomers, had turned her cup upside down and placed a nibbled bit of sugar beside it, and sat quietly in her armchair, though hoping to be offered another cup of tea. Iv\u00e1nushka, sipping out of her saucer, looked with sly womanish eyes from under her brows at the young men.\n\n\u201cWhere have you been? To Kiev?\u201d Prince Andrew asked the old woman.\n\n\u201cI have, good sir,\u201d she answered garrulously. \u201cJust at Christmastime I was deemed worthy to partake of the holy and heavenly sacrament at the shrine of the saint. And now I\u2019m from Koly\u00e1zin, master, where a great and wonderful blessing has been revealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd was Iv\u00e1nushka with you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI go by myself, benefactor,\u201d said Iv\u00e1nushka, trying to speak in a bass voice. \u201cI only came across Pelag\u00e9ya in Y\u00fakhnovo....\u201d\n\nPelag\u00e9ya interrupted her companion; she evidently wished to tell what she had seen.\n\n\u201cIn Koly\u00e1zin, master, a wonderful blessing has been revealed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it? Some new relics?\u201d asked Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cAndrew, do leave off,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cDon\u2019t tell him, Pelag\u00e9ya.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo... why not, my dear, why shouldn\u2019t I? I like him. He is kind, he is one of God\u2019s chosen, he\u2019s a benefactor, he once gave me ten rubles, I remember. When I was in Kiev, Crazy Cyril says to me (he\u2019s one of God\u2019s own and goes barefoot summer and winter), he says, \u2018Why are you not going to the right place? Go to Koly\u00e1zin where a wonder-working icon of the Holy Mother of God has been revealed.\u2019 On hearing those words I said good-by to the holy folk and went.\u201d\n\nAll were silent, only the pilgrim woman went on in measured tones, drawing in her breath.\n\n\u201cSo I come, master, and the people say to me: \u2018A great blessing has been revealed, holy oil trickles from the cheeks of our blessed Mother, the Holy Virgin Mother of God.\u2019...\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right, you can tell us afterwards,\u201d said Princess Mary, flushing.\n\n\u201cLet me ask her,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cDid you see it yourselves?\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, master, I was found worthy. Such a brightness on the face like the light of heaven, and from the blessed Mother\u2019s cheek it drops and drops....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, dear me, that must be a fraud!\u201d said Pierre, na\u00efvely, who had listened attentively to the pilgrim.\n\n\u201cOh, master, what are you saying?\u201d exclaimed the horrified Pelag\u00e9ya, turning to Princess Mary for support.\n\n\u201cThey impose on the people,\u201d he repeated.\n\n\u201cLord Jesus Christ!\u201d exclaimed the pilgrim woman, crossing herself. \u201cOh, don\u2019t speak so, master! There was a general who did not believe, and said, \u2018The monks cheat,\u2019 and as soon as he\u2019d said it he went blind. And he dreamed that the Holy Virgin Mother of the Kiev catacombs came to him and said, \u2018Believe in me and I will make you whole.\u2019 So he begged: \u2018Take me to her, take me to her.\u2019 It\u2019s the real truth I\u2019m telling you, I saw it myself. So he was brought, quite blind, straight to her, and he goes up to her and falls down and says, \u2018Make me whole,\u2019 says he, \u2018and I\u2019ll give thee what the Tsar bestowed on me.\u2019 I saw it myself, master, the star is fixed into the icon. Well, and what do you think? He received his sight! It\u2019s a sin to speak so. God will punish you,\u201d she said admonishingly, turning to Pierre.\n\n\u201cHow did the star get into the icon?\u201d Pierre asked.\n\n\u201cAnd was the Holy Mother promoted to the rank of general?\u201d said Prince Andrew, with a smile.\n\nPelag\u00e9ya suddenly grew quite pale and clasped her hands.\n\n\u201cOh, master, master, what a sin! And you who have a son!\u201d she began, her pallor suddenly turning to a vivid red. \u201cMaster, what have you said? God forgive you!\u201d And she crossed herself. \u201cLord forgive him! My dear, what does it mean?...\u201d she asked, turning to Princess Mary. She got up and, almost crying, began to arrange her wallet. She evidently felt frightened and ashamed to have accepted charity in a house where such things could be said, and was at the same time sorry to have now to forgo the charity of this house.\n\n\u201cNow, why need you do it?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cWhy did you come to me?...\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, Pelag\u00e9ya, I was joking,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cPrincesse, ma parole, je n\u2019ai pas voulu l\u2019offenser. I did not mean anything, I was only joking,\u201d he said, smiling shyly and trying to efface his offense. \u201cIt was all my fault, and Andrew was only joking.\u201d\n\nPelag\u00e9ya stopped doubtfully, but in Pierre\u2019s face there was such a look of sincere penitence, and Prince Andrew glanced so meekly now at her and now at Pierre, that she was gradually reassured.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThe pilgrim woman was appeased and, being encouraged to talk, gave a long account of Father Amphilochus, who led so holy a life that his hands smelled of incense, and how on her last visit to Kiev some monks she knew let her have the keys of the catacombs, and how she, taking some dried bread with her, had spent two days in the catacombs with the saints. \u201cI\u2019d pray awhile to one, ponder awhile, then go on to another. I\u2019d sleep a bit and then again go and kiss the relics, and there was such peace all around, such blessedness, that one don\u2019t want to come out, even into the light of heaven again.\u201d\n\nPierre listened to her attentively and seriously. Prince Andrew went out of the room, and then, leaving \u201cGod\u2019s folk\u201d to finish their tea, Princess Mary took Pierre into the drawing room.\n\n\u201cYou are very kind,\u201d she said to him.\n\n\u201cOh, I really did not mean to hurt her feelings. I understand them so well and have the greatest respect for them.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him silently and smiled affectionately.\n\n\u201cI have known you a long time, you see, and am as fond of you as of a brother,\u201d she said. \u201cHow do you find Andrew?\u201d she added hurriedly, not giving him time to reply to her affectionate words. \u201cI am very anxious about him. His health was better in the winter, but last spring his wound reopened and the doctor said he ought to go away for a cure. And I am also very much afraid for him spiritually. He has not a character like us women who, when we suffer, can weep away our sorrows. He keeps it all within him. Today he is cheerful and in good spirits, but that is the effect of your visit\u2014he is not often like that. If you could persuade him to go abroad. He needs activity, and this quiet regular life is very bad for him. Others don\u2019t notice it, but I see it.\u201d\n\nToward ten o\u2019clock the men servants rushed to the front door, hearing the bells of the old prince\u2019s carriage approaching. Prince Andrew and Pierre also went out into the porch.\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d asked the old prince, noticing Pierre as he got out of the carriage.\n\n\u201cAh! Very glad! Kiss me,\u201d he said, having learned who the young stranger was.\n\nThe old prince was in a good temper and very gracious to Pierre.\n\nBefore supper, Prince Andrew, coming back to his father\u2019s study, found him disputing hotly with his visitor. Pierre was maintaining that a time would come when there would be no more wars. The old prince disputed it chaffingly, but without getting angry.\n\n\u201cDrain the blood from men\u2019s veins and put in water instead, then there will be no more war! Old women\u2019s nonsense\u2014old women\u2019s nonsense!\u201d he repeated, but still he patted Pierre affectionately on the shoulder, and then went up to the table where Prince Andrew, evidently not wishing to join in the conversation, was looking over the papers his father had brought from town. The old prince went up to him and began to talk business.\n\n\u201cThe marshal, a Count Rost\u00f3v, hasn\u2019t sent half his contingent. He came to town and wanted to invite me to dinner\u2014I gave him a pretty dinner!... And there, look at this.... Well, my boy,\u201d the old prince went on, addressing his son and patting Pierre on the shoulder. \u201cA fine fellow\u2014your friend\u2014I like him! He stirs me up. Another says clever things and one doesn\u2019t care to listen, but this one talks rubbish yet stirs an old fellow up. Well, go! Get along! Perhaps I\u2019ll come and sit with you at supper. We\u2019ll have another dispute. Make friends with my little fool, Princess Mary,\u201d he shouted after Pierre, through the door.\n\nOnly now, on his visit to Bald Hills, did Pierre fully realize the strength and charm of his friendship with Prince Andrew. That charm was not expressed so much in his relations with him as with all his family and with the household. With the stern old prince and the gentle, timid Princess Mary, though he had scarcely known them, Pierre at once felt like an old friend. They were all fond of him already. Not only Princess Mary, who had been won by his gentleness with the pilgrims, gave him her most radiant looks, but even the one-year-old \u201cPrince Nicholas\u201d (as his grandfather called him) smiled at Pierre and let himself be taken in his arms, and Michael Iv\u00e1novich and Mademoiselle Bourienne looked at him with pleasant smiles when he talked to the old prince.\n\nThe old prince came in to supper; this was evidently on Pierre\u2019s account. And during the two days of the young man\u2019s visit he was extremely kind to him and told him to visit them again.\n\nWhen Pierre had gone and the members of the household met together, they began to express their opinions of him as people always do after a new acquaintance has left, but as seldom happens, no one said anything but what was good of him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWhen returning from his leave, Rost\u00f3v felt, for the first time, how close was the bond that united him to Den\u00edsov and the whole regiment.\n\nOn approaching it, Rost\u00f3v felt as he had done when approaching his home in Moscow. When he saw the first hussar with the unbuttoned uniform of his regiment, when he recognized red-haired Dem\u00e9ntyev and saw the picket ropes of the roan horses, when Lavr\u00fashka gleefully shouted to his master, \u201cThe count has come!\u201d and Den\u00edsov, who had been asleep on his bed, ran all disheveled out of the mud hut to embrace him, and the officers collected round to greet the new arrival, Rost\u00f3v experienced the same feeling as when his mother, his father, and his sister had embraced him, and tears of joy choked him so that he could not speak. The regiment was also a home, and as unalterably dear and precious as his parents\u2019 house.\n\nWhen he had reported himself to the commander of the regiment and had been reassigned to his former squadron, had been on duty and had gone out foraging, when he had again entered into all the little interests of the regiment and felt himself deprived of liberty and bound in one narrow, unchanging frame, he experienced the same sense of peace, of moral support, and the same sense of being at home here in his own place, as he had felt under the parental roof. But here was none of all that turmoil of the world at large, where he did not know his right place and took mistaken decisions; here was no S\u00f3nya with whom he ought, or ought not, to have an explanation; here was no possibility of going there or not going there; here there were not twenty-four hours in the day which could be spent in such a variety of ways; there was not that innumerable crowd of people of whom not one was nearer to him or farther from him than another; there were none of those uncertain and undefined money relations with his father, and nothing to recall that terrible loss to D\u00f3lokhov. Here, in the regiment, all was clear and simple. The whole world was divided into two unequal parts: one, our P\u00e1vlograd regiment; the other, all the rest. And the rest was no concern of his. In the regiment, everything was definite: who was lieutenant, who captain, who was a good fellow, who a bad one, and most of all, who was a comrade. The canteenkeeper gave one credit, one\u2019s pay came every four months, there was nothing to think out or decide, you had only to do nothing that was considered bad in the P\u00e1vlograd regiment and, when given an order, to do what was clearly, distinctly, and definitely ordered\u2014and all would be well.\n\nHaving once more entered into the definite conditions of this regimental life, Rost\u00f3v felt the joy and relief a tired man feels on lying down to rest. Life in the regiment, during this campaign, was all the pleasanter for him, because, after his loss to D\u00f3lokhov (for which, in spite of all his family\u2019s efforts to console him, he could not forgive himself), he had made up his mind to atone for his fault by serving, not as he had done before, but really well, and by being a perfectly first-rate comrade and officer\u2014in a word, a splendid man altogether, a thing which seemed so difficult out in the world, but so possible in the regiment.\n\nAfter his losses, he had determined to pay back his debt to his parents in five years. He received ten thousand rubles a year, but now resolved to take only two thousand and leave the rest to repay the debt to his parents.\n\nOur army, after repeated retreats and advances and battles at Pult\u00fask and Preussisch-Eylau, was concentrated near Bartenstein. It was awaiting the Emperor\u2019s arrival and the beginning of a new campaign.\n\nThe P\u00e1vlograd regiment, belonging to that part of the army which had served in the 1805 campaign, had been recruiting up to strength in Russia, and arrived too late to take part in the first actions of the campaign. It had been neither at Pult\u00fask nor at Preussisch-Eylau and, when it joined the army in the field in the second half of the campaign, was attached to Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s division.\n\nPl\u00e1tov\u2019s division was acting independently of the main army. Several times parts of the P\u00e1vlograd regiment had exchanged shots with the enemy, had taken prisoners, and once had even captured Marshal Oudinot\u2019s carriages. In April the P\u00e1vlograds were stationed immovably for some weeks near a totally ruined and deserted German village.\n\nA thaw had set in, it was muddy and cold, the ice on the river broke, and the roads became impassable. For days neither provisions for the men nor fodder for the horses had been issued. As no transports could arrive, the men dispersed about the abandoned and deserted villages, searching for potatoes, but found few even of these.\n\nEverything had been eaten up and the inhabitants had all fled\u2014if any remained, they were worse than beggars and nothing more could be taken from them; even the soldiers, usually pitiless enough, instead of taking anything from them, often gave them the last of their rations.\n\nThe P\u00e1vlograd regiment had had only two men wounded in action, but had lost nearly half its men from hunger and sickness. In the hospitals, death was so certain that soldiers suffering from fever, or the swelling that came from bad food, preferred to remain on duty, and hardly able to drag their legs went to the front rather than to the hospitals. When spring came on, the soldiers found a plant just showing out of the ground that looked like asparagus, which, for some reason, they called \u201cM\u00e1shka\u2019s sweet root.\u201d It was very bitter, but they wandered about the fields seeking it and dug it out with their sabers and ate it, though they were ordered not to do so, as it was a noxious plant. That spring a new disease broke out among the soldiers, a swelling of the arms, legs, and face, which the doctors attributed to eating this root. But in spite of all this, the soldiers of Den\u00edsov\u2019s squadron fed chiefly on \u201cM\u00e1shka\u2019s sweet root,\u201d because it was the second week that the last of the biscuits were being doled out at the rate of half a pound a man and the last potatoes received had sprouted and frozen.\n\nThe horses also had been fed for a fortnight on straw from the thatched roofs and had become terribly thin, though still covered with tufts of felty winter hair.\n\nDespite this destitution, the soldiers and officers went on living just as usual. Despite their pale swollen faces and tattered uniforms, the hussars formed line for roll call, kept things in order, groomed their horses, polished their arms, brought in straw from the thatched roofs in place of fodder, and sat down to dine round the caldrons from which they rose up hungry, joking about their nasty food and their hunger. As usual, in their spare time, they lit bonfires, steamed themselves before them naked; smoked, picked out and baked sprouting rotten potatoes, told and listened to stories of Pot\u00ebmkin\u2019s and Suv\u00f3rov\u2019s campaigns, or to legends of Al\u00ebsha the Sly, or the priest\u2019s laborer Mik\u00f3lka.\n\nThe officers, as usual, lived in twos and threes in the roofless, half-ruined houses. The seniors tried to collect straw and potatoes and, in general, food for the men. The younger ones occupied themselves as before, some playing cards (there was plenty of money, though there was no food), some with more innocent games, such as quoits and skittles. The general trend of the campaign was rarely spoken of, partly because nothing certain was known about it, partly because there was a vague feeling that in the main it was going badly.\n\nRost\u00f3v lived, as before, with Den\u00edsov, and since their furlough they had become more friendly than ever. Den\u00edsov never spoke of Rost\u00f3v\u2019s family, but by the tender friendship his commander showed him, Rost\u00f3v felt that the elder hussar\u2019s luckless love for Nat\u00e1sha played a part in strengthening their friendship. Den\u00edsov evidently tried to expose Rost\u00f3v to danger as seldom as possible, and after an action greeted his safe return with evident joy. On one of his foraging expeditions, in a deserted and ruined village to which he had come in search of provisions, Rost\u00f3v found a family consisting of an old Pole and his daughter with an infant in arms. They were half clad, hungry, too weak to get away on foot and had no means of obtaining a conveyance. Rost\u00f3v brought them to his quarters, placed them in his own lodging, and kept them for some weeks while the old man was recovering. One of his comrades, talking of women, began chaffing Rost\u00f3v, saying that he was more wily than any of them and that it would not be a bad thing if he introduced to them the pretty Polish girl he had saved. Rost\u00f3v took the joke as an insult, flared up, and said such unpleasant things to the officer that it was all Den\u00edsov could do to prevent a duel. When the officer had gone away, Den\u00edsov, who did not himself know what Rost\u00f3v\u2019s relations with the Polish girl might be, began to upbraid him for his quickness of temper, and Rost\u00f3v replied:\n\n\u201cSay what you like.... She is like a sister to me, and I can\u2019t tell you how it offended me... because... well, for that reason....\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov patted him on the shoulder and began rapidly pacing the room without looking at Rost\u00f3v, as was his way at moments of deep feeling.\n\n\u201cAh, what a mad bweed you Wost\u00f3vs are!\u201d he muttered, and Rost\u00f3v noticed tears in his eyes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIn April the troops were enlivened by news of the Emperor\u2019s arrival, but Rost\u00f3v had no chance of being present at the review he held at Bartenstein, as the P\u00e1vlograds were at the outposts far beyond that place.\n\nThey were bivouacking. Den\u00edsov and Rost\u00f3v were living in an earth hut, dug out for them by the soldiers and roofed with branches and turf. The hut was made in the following manner, which had then come into vogue. A trench was dug three and a half feet wide, four feet eight inches deep, and eight feet long. At one end of the trench, steps were cut out and these formed the entrance and vestibule. The trench itself was the room, in which the lucky ones, such as the squadron commander, had a board, lying on piles at the end opposite the entrance, to serve as a table. On each side of the trench, the earth was cut out to a breadth of about two and a half feet, and this did duty for bedsteads and couches. The roof was so constructed that one could stand up in the middle of the trench and could even sit up on the beds if one drew close to the table. Den\u00edsov, who was living luxuriously because the soldiers of his squadron liked him, had also a board in the roof at the farther end, with a piece of (broken but mended) glass in it for a window. When it was very cold, embers from the soldiers\u2019 campfire were placed on a bent sheet of iron on the steps in the \u201creception room\u201d\u2014as Den\u00edsov called that part of the hut\u2014and it was then so warm that the officers, of whom there were always some with Den\u00edsov and Rost\u00f3v, sat in their shirt sleeves.\n\nIn April, Rost\u00f3v was on orderly duty. One morning, between seven and eight, returning after a sleepless night, he sent for embers, changed his rain-soaked underclothes, said his prayers, drank tea, got warm, then tidied up the things on the table and in his own corner, and, his face glowing from exposure to the wind and with nothing on but his shirt, lay down on his back, putting his arms under his head. He was pleasantly considering the probability of being promoted in a few days for his last reconnoitering expedition, and was awaiting Den\u00edsov, who had gone out somewhere and with whom he wanted a talk.\n\nSuddenly he heard Den\u00edsov shouting in a vibrating voice behind the hut, evidently much excited. Rost\u00f3v moved to the window to see whom he was speaking to, and saw the quartermaster, Topch\u00e9enko.\n\n\u201cI ordered you not to let them eat that M\u00e1shka woot stuff!\u201d Den\u00edsov was shouting. \u201cAnd I saw with my own eyes how Lazarch\u00fak bwought some fwom the fields.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have given the order again and again, your honor, but they don\u2019t obey,\u201d answered the quartermaster.\n\nRost\u00f3v lay down again on his bed and thought complacently: \u201cLet him fuss and bustle now, my job\u2019s done and I\u2019m lying down\u2014capitally!\u201d He could hear that Lavr\u00fashka\u2014that sly, bold orderly of Den\u00edsov\u2019s\u2014was talking, as well as the quartermaster. Lavr\u00fashka was saying something about loaded wagons, biscuits, and oxen he had seen when he had gone out for provisions.\n\nThen Den\u00edsov\u2019s voice was heard shouting farther and farther away. \u201cSaddle! Second platoon!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are they off to now?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\nFive minutes later, Den\u00edsov came into the hut, climbed with muddy boots on the bed, lit his pipe, furiously scattered his things about, took his leaded whip, buckled on his saber, and went out again. In answer to Rost\u00f3v\u2019s inquiry where he was going, he answered vaguely and crossly that he had some business.\n\n\u201cLet God and our gweat monarch judge me afterwards!\u201d said Den\u00edsov going out, and Rost\u00f3v heard the hoofs of several horses splashing through the mud. He did not even trouble to find out where Den\u00edsov had gone. Having got warm in his corner, he fell asleep and did not leave the hut till toward evening. Den\u00edsov had not yet returned. The weather had cleared up, and near the next hut two officers and a cadet were playing sv\u00e1yka, laughing as they threw their missiles which buried themselves in the soft mud. Rost\u00f3v joined them. In the middle of the game, the officers saw some wagons approaching with fifteen hussars on their skinny horses behind them. The wagons escorted by the hussars drew up to the picket ropes and a crowd of hussars surrounded them.\n\n\u201cThere now, Den\u00edsov has been worrying,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, \u201cand here are the provisions.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo they are!\u201d said the officers. \u201cWon\u2019t the soldiers be glad!\u201d\n\nA little behind the hussars came Den\u00edsov, accompanied by two infantry officers with whom he was talking.\n\nRost\u00f3v went to meet them.\n\n\u201cI warn you, Captain,\u201d one of the officers, a short thin man, evidently very angry, was saying.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I told you I won\u2019t give them up?\u201d replied Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cYou will answer for it, Captain. It is mutiny\u2014seizing the transport of one\u2019s own army. Our men have had nothing to eat for two days.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd mine have had nothing for two weeks,\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cIt is robbery! You\u2019ll answer for it, sir!\u201d said the infantry officer, raising his voice.\n\n\u201cNow, what are you pestewing me for?\u201d cried Den\u00edsov, suddenly losing his temper. \u201cI shall answer for it and not you, and you\u2019d better not buzz about here till you get hurt. Be off! Go!\u201d he shouted at the officers.\n\n\u201cVery well, then!\u201d shouted the little officer, undaunted and not riding away. \u201cIf you are determined to rob, I\u2019ll...\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to the devil! quick ma\u2019ch, while you\u2019re safe and sound!\u201d and Den\u00edsov turned his horse on the officer.\n\n\u201cVery well, very well!\u201d muttered the officer, threateningly, and turning his horse he trotted away, jolting in his saddle.\n\n\u201cA dog astwide a fence! A weal dog astwide a fence!\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov after him (the most insulting expression a cavalryman can address to a mounted infantryman) and riding up to Rost\u00f3v, he burst out laughing.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve taken twansports from the infantwy by force!\u201d he said. \u201cAfter all, can\u2019t let our men starve.\u201d\n\nThe wagons that had reached the hussars had been consigned to an infantry regiment, but learning from Lavr\u00fashka that the transport was unescorted, Den\u00edsov with his hussars had seized it by force. The soldiers had biscuits dealt out to them freely, and they even shared them with the other squadrons.\n\nThe next day the regimental commander sent for Den\u00edsov, and holding his fingers spread out before his eyes said:\n\n\u201cThis is how I look at this affair: I know nothing about it and won\u2019t begin proceedings, but I advise you to ride over to the staff and settle the business there in the commissariat department and if possible sign a receipt for such and such stores received. If not, as the demand was booked against an infantry regiment, there will be a row and the affair may end badly.\u201d\n\nFrom the regimental commander\u2019s, Den\u00edsov rode straight to the staff with a sincere desire to act on this advice. In the evening he came back to his dugout in a state such as Rost\u00f3v had never yet seen him in. Den\u00edsov could not speak and gasped for breath. When Rost\u00f3v asked what was the matter, he only uttered some incoherent oaths and threats in a hoarse, feeble voice.\n\nAlarmed at Den\u00edsov\u2019s condition, Rost\u00f3v suggested that he should undress, drink some water, and send for the doctor.\n\n\u201cTwy me for wobbewy... oh! Some more water... Let them twy me, but I\u2019ll always thwash scoundwels... and I\u2019ll tell the Empewo\u2019... Ice...\u201d he muttered.\n\nThe regimental doctor, when he came, said it was absolutely necessary to bleed Den\u00edsov. A deep saucer of black blood was taken from his hairy arm and only then was he able to relate what had happened to him.\n\n\u201cI get there,\u201d began Den\u00edsov. \u201c\u2018Now then, where\u2019s your chief\u2019s quarters?\u2019 They were pointed out. \u2018Please to wait.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019ve widden twenty miles and have duties to attend to and no time to wait. Announce me.\u2019 Vewy well, so out comes their head chief\u2014also took it into his head to lecture me: \u2018It\u2019s wobbewy!\u2019\u2014\u2018Wobbewy,\u2019 I say, \u2018is not done by man who seizes pwovisions to feed his soldiers, but by him who takes them to fill his own pockets!\u2019 \u2018Will you please be silent?\u2019 \u2018Vewy good!\u2019 Then he says: \u2018Go and give a weceipt to the commissioner, but your affair will be passed on to headquarters.\u2019 I go to the commissioner. I enter, and at the table... who do you think? No, but wait a bit!... Who is it that\u2019s starving us?\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, hitting the table with the fist of his newly bled arm so violently that the table nearly broke down and the tumblers on it jumped about. \u201cTely\u00e1nin! \u2018What? So it\u2019s you who\u2019s starving us to death! Is it? Take this and this!\u2019 and I hit him so pat, stwaight on his snout... \u2018Ah, what a... what a...!\u2019 and I sta\u2019ted fwashing him... Well, I\u2019ve had a bit of fun I can tell you!\u201d cried Den\u00edsov, gleeful and yet angry, his white teeth showing under his black mustache. \u201cI\u2019d have killed him if they hadn\u2019t taken him away!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what are you shouting for? Calm yourself,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cYou\u2019ve set your arm bleeding afresh. Wait, we must tie it up again.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov was bandaged up again and put to bed. Next day he woke calm and cheerful.\n\nBut at noon the adjutant of the regiment came into Rost\u00f3v\u2019s and Den\u00edsov\u2019s dugout with a grave and serious face and regretfully showed them a paper addressed to Major Den\u00edsov from the regimental commander in which inquiries were made about yesterday\u2019s occurrence. The adjutant told them that the affair was likely to take a very bad turn: that a court-martial had been appointed, and that in view of the severity with which marauding and insubordination were now regarded, degradation to the ranks would be the best that could be hoped for.\n\nThe case, as represented by the offended parties, was that, after seizing the transports, Major Den\u00edsov, being drunk, went to the chief quartermaster and without any provocation called him a thief, threatened to strike him, and on being led out had rushed into the office and given two officials a thrashing, and dislocated the arm of one of them.\n\nIn answer to Rost\u00f3v\u2019s renewed questions, Den\u00edsov said, laughing, that he thought he remembered that some other fellow had got mixed up in it, but that it was all nonsense and rubbish, and he did not in the least fear any kind of trial, and that if those scoundrels dared attack him he would give them an answer that they would not easily forget.\n\nDen\u00edsov spoke contemptuously of the whole matter, but Rost\u00f3v knew him too well not to detect that (while hiding it from others) at heart he feared a court-martial and was worried over the affair, which was evidently taking a bad turn. Every day, letters of inquiry and notices from the court arrived, and on the first of May, Den\u00edsov was ordered to hand the squadron over to the next in seniority and appear before the staff of his division to explain his violence at the commissariat office. On the previous day Pl\u00e1tov reconnoitered with two Cossack regiments and two squadrons of hussars. Den\u00edsov, as was his wont, rode out in front of the outposts, parading his courage. A bullet fired by a French sharpshooter hit him in the fleshy part of his leg. Perhaps at another time Den\u00edsov would not have left the regiment for so slight a wound, but now he took advantage of it to excuse himself from appearing at the staff and went into hospital.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nIn June the battle of Friedland was fought, in which the P\u00e1vlograds did not take part, and after that an armistice was proclaimed. Rost\u00f3v, who felt his friend\u2019s absence very much, having no news of him since he left and feeling very anxious about his wound and the progress of his affairs, took advantage of the armistice to get leave to visit Den\u00edsov in hospital.\n\nThe hospital was in a small Prussian town that had been twice devastated by Russian and French troops. Because it was summer, when it is so beautiful out in the fields, the little town presented a particularly dismal appearance with its broken roofs and fences, its foul streets, tattered inhabitants, and the sick and drunken soldiers wandering about.\n\nThe hospital was in a brick building with some of the window frames and panes broken and a courtyard surrounded by the remains of a wooden fence that had been pulled to pieces. Several bandaged soldiers, with pale swollen faces, were sitting or walking about in the sunshine in the yard.\n\nDirectly Rost\u00f3v entered the door he was enveloped by a smell of putrefaction and hospital air. On the stairs he met a Russian army doctor smoking a cigar. The doctor was followed by a Russian assistant.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tear myself to pieces,\u201d the doctor was saying. \u201cCome to Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich in the evening. I shall be there.\u201d\n\nThe assistant asked some further questions.\n\n\u201cOh, do the best you can! Isn\u2019t it all the same?\u201d The doctor noticed Rost\u00f3v coming upstairs.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, sir?\u201d said the doctor. \u201cWhat do you want? The bullets having spared you, do you want to try typhus? This is a pesthouse, sir.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow so?\u201d asked Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cTyphus, sir. It\u2019s death to go in. Only we two, Mak\u00e9ev and I\u201d (he pointed to the assistant), \u201ckeep on here. Some five of us doctors have died in this place.... When a new one comes he is done for in a week,\u201d said the doctor with evident satisfaction. \u201cPrussian doctors have been invited here, but our allies don\u2019t like it at all.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v explained that he wanted to see Major Den\u00edsov of the hussars, who was wounded.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. I can\u2019t tell you, sir. Only think! I am alone in charge of three hospitals with more than four hundred patients! It\u2019s well that the charitable Prussian ladies send us two pounds of coffee and some lint each month or we should be lost!\u201d he laughed. \u201cFour hundred, sir, and they\u2019re always sending me fresh ones. There are four hundred? Eh?\u201d he asked, turning to the assistant.\n\nThe assistant looked fagged out. He was evidently vexed and impatient for the talkative doctor to go.\n\n\u201cMajor Den\u00edsov,\u201d Rost\u00f3v said again. \u201cHe was wounded at Molliten.\u201d\n\n\u201cDead, I fancy. Eh, Mak\u00e9ev?\u201d queried the doctor, in a tone of indifference.\n\nThe assistant, however, did not confirm the doctor\u2019s words.\n\n\u201cIs he tall and with reddish hair?\u201d asked the doctor.\n\nRost\u00f3v described Den\u00edsov\u2019s appearance.\n\n\u201cThere was one like that,\u201d said the doctor, as if pleased. \u201cThat one is dead, I fancy. However, I\u2019ll look up our list. We had a list. Have you got it, Mak\u00e9ev?\u201d\n\n\u201cMak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich has the list,\u201d answered the assistant. \u201cBut if you\u2019ll step into the officers\u2019 wards you\u2019ll see for yourself,\u201d he added, turning to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019d better not go, sir,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cor you may have to stay here yourself.\u201d\n\nBut Rost\u00f3v bowed himself away from the doctor and asked the assistant to show him the way.\n\n\u201cOnly don\u2019t blame me!\u201d the doctor shouted up after him.\n\nRost\u00f3v and the assistant went into the dark corridor. The smell was so strong there that Rost\u00f3v held his nose and had to pause and collect his strength before he could go on. A door opened to the right, and an emaciated sallow man on crutches, barefoot and in underclothing, limped out and, leaning against the doorpost, looked with glittering envious eyes at those who were passing. Glancing in at the door, Rost\u00f3v saw that the sick and wounded were lying on the floor on straw and overcoats.\n\n\u201cMay I go in and look?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is there to see?\u201d said the assistant.\n\nBut, just because the assistant evidently did not want him to go in, Rost\u00f3v entered the soldiers\u2019 ward. The foul air, to which he had already begun to get used in the corridor, was still stronger here. It was a little different, more pungent, and one felt that this was where it originated.\n\nIn the long room, brightly lit up by the sun through the large windows, the sick and wounded lay in two rows with their heads to the walls, and leaving a passage in the middle. Most of them were unconscious and paid no attention to the newcomers. Those who were conscious raised themselves or lifted their thin yellow faces, and all looked intently at Rost\u00f3v with the same expression of hope, of relief, reproach, and envy of another\u2019s health. Rost\u00f3v went to the middle of the room and looking through the open doors into the two adjoining rooms saw the same thing there. He stood still, looking silently around. He had not at all expected such a sight. Just before him, almost across the middle of the passage on the bare floor, lay a sick man, probably a Cossack to judge by the cut of his hair. The man lay on his back, his huge arms and legs outstretched. His face was purple, his eyes were rolled back so that only the whites were seen, and on his bare legs and arms which were still red, the veins stood out like cords. He was knocking the back of his head against the floor, hoarsely uttering some word which he kept repeating. Rost\u00f3v listened and made out the word. It was \u201cdrink, drink, a drink!\u201d Rost\u00f3v glanced round, looking for someone who would put this man back in his place and bring him water.\n\n\u201cWho looks after the sick here?\u201d he asked the assistant.\n\nJust then a commissariat soldier, a hospital orderly, came in from the next room, marching stiffly, and drew up in front of Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cGood day, your honor!\u201d he shouted, rolling his eyes at Rost\u00f3v and evidently mistaking him for one of the hospital authorities.\n\n\u201cGet him to his place and give him some water,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, pointing to the Cossack.\n\n\u201cYes, your honor,\u201d the soldier replied complacently, and rolling his eyes more than ever he drew himself up still straighter, but did not move.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s impossible to do anything here,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, lowering his eyes, and he was going out, but became aware of an intense look fixed on him on his right, and he turned. Close to the corner, on an overcoat, sat an old, unshaven, gray-bearded soldier as thin as a skeleton, with a stern sallow face and eyes intently fixed on Rost\u00f3v. The man\u2019s neighbor on one side whispered something to him, pointing at Rost\u00f3v, who noticed that the old man wanted to speak to him. He drew nearer and saw that the old man had only one leg bent under him, the other had been amputated above the knee. His neighbor on the other side, who lay motionless some distance from him with his head thrown back, was a young soldier with a snub nose. His pale waxen face was still freckled and his eyes were rolled back. Rost\u00f3v looked at the young soldier and a cold chill ran down his back.\n\n\u201cWhy, this one seems...\u201d he began, turning to the assistant.\n\n\u201cAnd how we\u2019ve been begging, your honor,\u201d said the old soldier, his jaw quivering. \u201cHe\u2019s been dead since morning. After all we\u2019re men, not dogs.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll send someone at once. He shall be taken away\u2014taken away at once,\u201d said the assistant hurriedly. \u201cLet us go, your honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, let us go,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v hastily, and lowering his eyes and shrinking, he tried to pass unnoticed between the rows of reproachful envious eyes that were fixed upon him, and went out of the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nGoing along the corridor, the assistant led Rost\u00f3v to the officers\u2019 wards, consisting of three rooms, the doors of which stood open. There were beds in these rooms and the sick and wounded officers were lying or sitting on them. Some were walking about the rooms in hospital dressing gowns. The first person Rost\u00f3v met in the officers\u2019 ward was a thin little man with one arm, who was walking about the first room in a nightcap and hospital dressing gown, with a pipe between his teeth. Rost\u00f3v looked at him, trying to remember where he had seen him before.\n\n\u201cSee where we\u2019ve met again!\u201d said the little man. \u201cT\u00fashin, T\u00fashin, don\u2019t you remember, who gave you a lift at Sch\u00f6n Grabern? And I\u2019ve had a bit cut off, you see...\u201d he went on with a smile, pointing to the empty sleeve of his dressing gown. \u201cLooking for Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich Den\u00edsov? My neighbor,\u201d he added, when he heard who Rost\u00f3v wanted. \u201cHere, here,\u201d and T\u00fashin led him into the next room, from whence came sounds of several laughing voices.\n\n\u201cHow can they laugh, or even live at all here?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, still aware of that smell of decomposing flesh that had been so strong in the soldiers\u2019 ward, and still seeming to see fixed on him those envious looks which had followed him out from both sides, and the face of that young soldier with eyes rolled back.\n\nDen\u00edsov lay asleep on his bed with his head under the blanket, though it was nearly noon.\n\n\u201cAh, Wost\u00f3v? How are you, how are you?\u201d he called out, still in the same voice as in the regiment, but Rost\u00f3v noticed sadly that under this habitual ease and animation some new, sinister, hidden feeling showed itself in the expression of Den\u00edsov\u2019s face and the intonations of his voice.\n\nHis wound, though a slight one, had not yet healed even now, six weeks after he had been hit. His face had the same swollen pallor as the faces of the other hospital patients, but it was not this that struck Rost\u00f3v. What struck him was that Den\u00edsov did not seem glad to see him, and smiled at him unnaturally. He did not ask about the regiment, nor about the general state of affairs, and when Rost\u00f3v spoke of these matters did not listen.\n\nRost\u00f3v even noticed that Den\u00edsov did not like to be reminded of the regiment, or in general of that other free life which was going on outside the hospital. He seemed to try to forget that old life and was only interested in the affair with the commissariat officers. On Rost\u00f3v\u2019s inquiry as to how the matter stood, he at once produced from under his pillow a paper he had received from the commission and the rough draft of his answer to it. He became animated when he began reading his paper and specially drew Rost\u00f3v\u2019s attention to the stinging rejoinders he made to his enemies. His hospital companions, who had gathered round Rost\u00f3v\u2014a fresh arrival from the world outside\u2014gradually began to disperse as soon as Den\u00edsov began reading his answer. Rost\u00f3v noticed by their faces that all those gentlemen had already heard that story more than once and were tired of it. Only the man who had the next bed, a stout Uhlan, continued to sit on his bed, gloomily frowning and smoking a pipe, and little one-armed T\u00fashin still listened, shaking his head disapprovingly. In the middle of the reading, the Uhlan interrupted Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cBut what I say is,\u201d he said, turning to Rost\u00f3v, \u201cit would be best simply to petition the Emperor for pardon. They say great rewards will now be distributed, and surely a pardon would be granted....\u201d\n\n\u201cMe petition the Empewo\u2019!\u201d exclaimed Den\u00edsov, in a voice to which he tried hard to give the old energy and fire, but which sounded like an expression of irritable impotence. \u201cWhat for? If I were a wobber I would ask mercy, but I\u2019m being court-martialed for bwinging wobbers to book. Let them twy me, I\u2019m not afwaid of anyone. I\u2019ve served the Tsar and my countwy honowably and have not stolen! And am I to be degwaded?... Listen, I\u2019m w\u2019iting to them stwaight. This is what I say: \u2018If I had wobbed the Tweasuwy...\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly well written,\u201d said T\u00fashin, \u201cbut that\u2019s not the point, Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich,\u201d and he also turned to Rost\u00f3v. \u201cOne has to submit, and Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich doesn\u2019t want to. You know the auditor told you it was a bad business.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let it be bad,\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cThe auditor wrote out a petition for you,\u201d continued T\u00fashin, \u201cand you ought to sign it and ask this gentleman to take it. No doubt he\u201d (indicating Rost\u00f3v) \u201chas connections on the staff. You won\u2019t find a better opportunity.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t I said I\u2019m not going to gwovel?\u201d Den\u00edsov interrupted him, went on reading his paper.\n\nRost\u00f3v had not the courage to persuade Den\u00edsov, though he instinctively felt that the way advised by T\u00fashin and the other officers was the safest, and though he would have been glad to be of service to Den\u00edsov. He knew his stubborn will and straightforward hasty temper.\n\nWhen the reading of Den\u00edsov\u2019s virulent reply, which took more than an hour, was over, Rost\u00f3v said nothing, and he spent the rest of the day in a most dejected state of mind amid Den\u00edsov\u2019s hospital comrades, who had gathered round him, telling them what he knew and listening to their stories. Den\u00edsov was moodily silent all the evening.\n\nLate in the evening, when Rost\u00f3v was about to leave, he asked Den\u00edsov whether he had no commission for him.\n\n\u201cYes, wait a bit,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, glancing round at the officers, and taking his papers from under his pillow he went to the window, where he had an inkpot, and sat down to write.\n\n\u201cIt seems it\u2019s no use knocking one\u2019s head against a wall!\u201d he said, coming from the window and giving Rost\u00f3v a large envelope. In it was the petition to the Emperor drawn up by the auditor, in which Den\u00edsov, without alluding to the offenses of the commissariat officials, simply asked for pardon.\n\n\u201cHand it in. It seems...\u201d\n\nHe did not finish, but gave a painfully unnatural smile.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nHaving returned to the regiment and told the commander the state of Den\u00edsov\u2019s affairs, Rost\u00f3v rode to Tilsit with the letter to the Emperor.\n\nOn the thirteenth of June the French and Russian Emperors arrived in Tilsit. Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y had asked the important personage on whom he was in attendance, to include him in the suite appointed for the stay at Tilsit.\n\n\u201cI should like to see the great man,\u201d he said, alluding to Napoleon, whom hitherto he, like everyone else, had always called Buonaparte.\n\n\u201cYou are speaking of Buonaparte?\u201d asked the general, smiling.\n\nBor\u00eds looked at his general inquiringly and immediately saw that he was being tested.\n\n\u201cI am speaking, Prince, of the Emperor Napoleon,\u201d he replied. The general patted him on the shoulder, with a smile.\n\n\u201cYou will go far,\u201d he said, and took him to Tilsit with him.\n\nBor\u00eds was among the few present at the Niemen on the day the two Emperors met. He saw the raft, decorated with monograms, saw Napoleon pass before the French Guards on the farther bank of the river, saw the pensive face of the Emperor Alexander as he sat in silence in a tavern on the bank of the Niemen awaiting Napoleon\u2019s arrival, saw both Emperors get into boats, and saw how Napoleon\u2014reaching the raft first\u2014stepped quickly forward to meet Alexander and held out his hand to him, and how they both retired into the pavilion. Since he had begun to move in the highest circles Bor\u00eds had made it his habit to watch attentively all that went on around him and to note it down. At the time of the meeting at Tilsit he asked the names of those who had come with Napoleon and about the uniforms they wore, and listened attentively to words spoken by important personages. At the moment the Emperors went into the pavilion he looked at his watch, and did not forget to look at it again when Alexander came out. The interview had lasted an hour and fifty-three minutes. He noted this down that same evening, among other facts he felt to be of historic importance. As the Emperor\u2019s suite was a very small one, it was a matter of great importance, for a man who valued his success in the service, to be at Tilsit on the occasion of this interview between the two Emperors, and having succeeded in this, Bor\u00eds felt that henceforth his position was fully assured. He had not only become known, but people had grown accustomed to him and accepted him. Twice he had executed commissions to the Emperor himself, so that the latter knew his face, and all those at court, far from cold-shouldering him as at first when they considered him a newcomer, would now have been surprised had he been absent.\n\nBor\u00eds lodged with another adjutant, the Polish Count Zhil\u00ednski. Zhil\u00ednski, a Pole brought up in Paris, was rich, and passionately fond of the French, and almost every day of the stay at Tilsit, French officers of the Guard and from French headquarters were dining and lunching with him and Bor\u00eds.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-fourth of June, Count Zhil\u00ednski arranged a supper for his French friends. The guest of honor was an aide-de-camp of Napoleon\u2019s, there were also several French officers of the Guard, and a page of Napoleon\u2019s, a young lad of an old aristocratic French family. That same day, Rost\u00f3v, profiting by the darkness to avoid being recognized in civilian dress, came to Tilsit and went to the lodging occupied by Bor\u00eds and Zhil\u00ednski.\n\nRost\u00f3v, in common with the whole army from which he came, was far from having experienced the change of feeling toward Napoleon and the French\u2014who from being foes had suddenly become friends\u2014that had taken place at headquarters and in Bor\u00eds. In the army, Bonaparte and the French were still regarded with mingled feelings of anger, contempt, and fear. Only recently, talking with one of Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s Cossack officers, Rost\u00f3v had argued that if Napoleon were taken prisoner he would be treated not as a sovereign, but as a criminal. Quite lately, happening to meet a wounded French colonel on the road, Rost\u00f3v had maintained with heat that peace was impossible between a legitimate sovereign and the criminal Bonaparte. Rost\u00f3v was therefore unpleasantly struck by the presence of French officers in Bor\u00eds\u2019 lodging, dressed in uniforms he had been accustomed to see from quite a different point of view from the outposts of the flank. As soon as he noticed a French officer, who thrust his head out of the door, that warlike feeling of hostility which he always experienced at the sight of the enemy suddenly seized him. He stopped at the threshold and asked in Russian whether Drubetsk\u00f3y lived there. Bor\u00eds, hearing a strange voice in the anteroom, came out to meet him. An expression of annoyance showed itself for a moment on his face on first recognizing Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s you? Very glad, very glad to see you,\u201d he said, however, coming toward him with a smile. But Rost\u00f3v had noticed his first impulse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve come at a bad time I think. I should not have come, but I have business,\u201d he said coldly.\n\n\u201cNo, I only wonder how you managed to get away from your regiment. Dans un moment je suis \u00e0 vous,\u201d he said, answering someone who called him.\n\n\u201cI see I\u2019m intruding,\u201d Rost\u00f3v repeated.\n\nThe look of annoyance had already disappeared from Bor\u00eds\u2019 face: having evidently reflected and decided how to act, he very quietly took both Rost\u00f3v\u2019s hands and led him into the next room. His eyes, looking serenely and steadily at Rost\u00f3v, seemed to be veiled by something, as if screened by blue spectacles of conventionality. So it seemed to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cOh, come now! As if you could come at a wrong time!\u201d said Bor\u00eds, and he led him into the room where the supper table was laid and introduced him to his guests, explaining that he was not a civilian, but an hussar officer, and an old friend of his.\n\n\u201cCount Zhil\u00ednski\u2014le Comte N. N.\u2014le Capitaine S. S.,\u201d said he, naming his guests. Rost\u00f3v looked frowningly at the Frenchmen, bowed reluctantly, and remained silent.\n\nZhil\u00ednski evidently did not receive this new Russian person very willingly into his circle and did not speak to Rost\u00f3v. Bor\u00eds did not appear to notice the constraint the newcomer produced and, with the same pleasant composure and the same veiled look in his eyes with which he had met Rost\u00f3v, tried to enliven the conversation. One of the Frenchmen, with the politeness characteristic of his countrymen, addressed the obstinately taciturn Rost\u00f3v, saying that the latter had probably come to Tilsit to see the Emperor.\n\n\u201cNo, I came on business,\u201d replied Rost\u00f3v, briefly.\n\nRost\u00f3v had been out of humor from the moment he noticed the look of dissatisfaction on Bor\u00eds\u2019 face, and as always happens to those in a bad humor, it seemed to him that everyone regarded him with aversion and that he was in everybody\u2019s way. He really was in their way, for he alone took no part in the conversation which again became general. The looks the visitors cast on him seemed to say: \u201cAnd what is he sitting here for?\u201d He rose and went up to Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cAnyhow, I\u2019m in your way,\u201d he said in a low tone. \u201cCome and talk over my business and I\u2019ll go away.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, not at all,\u201d said Bor\u00eds. \u201cBut if you are tired, come and lie down in my room and have a rest.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, really...\u201d\n\nThey went into the little room where Bor\u00eds slept. Rost\u00f3v, without sitting down, began at once, irritably (as if Bor\u00eds were to blame in some way) telling him about Den\u00edsov\u2019s affair, asking him whether, through his general, he could and would intercede with the Emperor on Den\u00edsov\u2019s behalf and get Den\u00edsov\u2019s petition handed in. When he and Bor\u00eds were alone, Rost\u00f3v felt for the first time that he could not look Bor\u00eds in the face without a sense of awkwardness. Bor\u00eds, with one leg crossed over the other and stroking his left hand with the slender fingers of his right, listened to Rost\u00f3v as a general listens to the report of a subordinate, now looking aside and now gazing straight into Rost\u00f3v\u2019s eyes with the same veiled look. Each time this happened Rost\u00f3v felt uncomfortable and cast down his eyes.\n\n\u201cI have heard of such cases and know that His Majesty is very severe in such affairs. I think it would be best not to bring it before the Emperor, but to apply to the commander of the corps.... But in general, I think...\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you don\u2019t want to do anything? Well then, say so!\u201d Rost\u00f3v almost shouted, not looking Bor\u00eds in the face.\n\nBor\u00eds smiled.\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, I will do what I can. Only I thought...\u201d\n\nAt that moment Zhil\u00ednski\u2019s voice was heard calling Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cWell then, go, go, go...\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, and refusing supper and remaining alone in the little room, he walked up and down for a long time, hearing the lighthearted French conversation from the next room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nRost\u00f3v had come to Tilsit the day least suitable for a petition on Den\u00edsov\u2019s behalf. He could not himself go to the general in attendance as he was in mufti and had come to Tilsit without permission to do so, and Bor\u00eds, even had he wished to, could not have done so on the following day. On that day, June 27, the preliminaries of peace were signed. The Emperors exchanged decorations: Alexander received the Cross of the Legion of Honor and Napoleon the Order of St. Andrew of the First Degree, and a dinner had been arranged for the evening, given by a battalion of the French Guards to the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk battalion. The Emperors were to be present at that banquet.\n\nRost\u00f3v felt so ill at ease and uncomfortable with Bor\u00eds that, when the latter looked in after supper, he pretended to be asleep, and early next morning went away, avoiding Bor\u00eds. In his civilian clothes and a round hat, he wandered about the town, staring at the French and their uniforms and at the streets and houses where the Russian and French Emperors were staying. In a square he saw tables being set up and preparations made for the dinner; he saw the Russian and French colors draped from side to side of the streets, with huge monograms A and N. In the windows of the houses also flags and bunting were displayed.\n\n\u201cBor\u00eds doesn\u2019t want to help me and I don\u2019t want to ask him. That\u2019s settled,\u201d thought Nicholas. \u201cAll is over between us, but I won\u2019t leave here without having done all I can for Den\u00edsov and certainly not without getting his letter to the Emperor. The Emperor!... He is here!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, who had unconsciously returned to the house where Alexander lodged.\n\nSaddled horses were standing before the house and the suite were assembling, evidently preparing for the Emperor to come out.\n\n\u201cI may see him at any moment,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIf only I were to hand the letter direct to him and tell him all... could they really arrest me for my civilian clothes? Surely not! He would understand on whose side justice lies. He understands everything, knows everything. Who can be more just, more magnanimous than he? And even if they did arrest me for being here, what would it matter?\u201d thought he, looking at an officer who was entering the house the Emperor occupied. \u201cAfter all, people do go in.... It\u2019s all nonsense! I\u2019ll go in and hand the letter to the Emperor myself so much the worse for Drubetsk\u00f3y who drives me to it!\u201d And suddenly with a determination he himself did not expect, Rost\u00f3v felt for the letter in his pocket and went straight to the house.\n\n\u201cNo, I won\u2019t miss my opportunity now, as I did after Austerlitz,\u201d he thought, expecting every moment to meet the monarch, and conscious of the blood that rushed to his heart at the thought. \u201cI will fall at his feet and beseech him. He will lift me up, will listen, and will even thank me. \u2018I am happy when I can do good, but to remedy injustice is the greatest happiness,\u2019\u201d Rost\u00f3v fancied the sovereign saying. And passing people who looked after him with curiosity, he entered the porch of the Emperor\u2019s house.\n\nA broad staircase led straight up from the entry, and to the right he saw a closed door. Below, under the staircase, was a door leading to the lower floor.\n\n\u201cWhom do you want?\u201d someone inquired.\n\n\u201cTo hand in a letter, a petition, to His Majesty,\u201d said Nicholas, with a tremor in his voice.\n\n\u201cA petition? This way, to the officer on duty\u201d (he was shown the door leading downstairs), \u201conly it won\u2019t be accepted.\u201d\n\nOn hearing this indifferent voice, Rost\u00f3v grew frightened at what he was doing; the thought of meeting the Emperor at any moment was so fascinating and consequently so alarming that he was ready to run away, but the official who had questioned him opened the door, and Rost\u00f3v entered.\n\nA short stout man of about thirty, in white breeches and high boots and a batiste shirt that he had evidently only just put on, standing in that room, and his valet was buttoning on to the back of his breeches a new pair of handsome silk-embroidered braces that, for some reason, attracted Rost\u00f3v\u2019s attention. This man was speaking to someone in the adjoining room.\n\n\u201cA good figure and in her first bloom,\u201d he was saying, but on seeing Rost\u00f3v, he stopped short and frowned.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? A petition?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked the person in the other room.\n\n\u201cAnother petitioner,\u201d answered the man with the braces.\n\n\u201cTell him to come later. He\u2019ll be coming out directly, we must go.\u201d\n\n\u201cLater... later! Tomorrow. It\u2019s too late...\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v turned and was about to go, but the man in the braces stopped him.\n\n\u201cWhom have you come from? Who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI come from Major Den\u00edsov,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cAre you an officer?\u201d\n\n\u201cLieutenant Count Rost\u00f3v.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat audacity! Hand it in through your commander. And go along with you... go,\u201d and he continued to put on the uniform the valet handed him.\n\nRost\u00f3v went back into the hall and noticed that in the porch there were many officers and generals in full parade uniform, whom he had to pass.\n\nCursing his temerity, his heart sinking at the thought of finding himself at any moment face to face with the Emperor and being put to shame and arrested in his presence, fully alive now to the impropriety of his conduct and repenting of it, Rost\u00f3v, with downcast eyes, was making his way out of the house through the brilliant suite when a familiar voice called him and a hand detained him.\n\n\u201cWhat are you doing here, sir, in civilian dress?\u201d asked a deep voice.\n\nIt was a cavalry general who had obtained the Emperor\u2019s special favor during this campaign, and who had formerly commanded the division in which Rost\u00f3v was serving.\n\nRost\u00f3v, in dismay, began justifying himself, but seeing the kindly, jocular face of the general, he took him aside and in an excited voice told him the whole affair, asking him to intercede for Den\u00edsov, whom the general knew. Having heard Rost\u00f3v to the end, the general shook his head gravely.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, sorry for that fine fellow. Give me the letter.\u201d\n\nHardly had Rost\u00f3v handed him the letter and finished explaining Den\u00edsov\u2019s case, when hasty steps and the jingling of spurs were heard on the stairs, and the general, leaving him, went to the porch. The gentlemen of the Emperor\u2019s suite ran down the stairs and went to their horses. Hayne, the same groom who had been at Austerlitz, led up the Emperor\u2019s horse, and the faint creak of a footstep Rost\u00f3v knew at once was heard on the stairs. Forgetting the danger of being recognized, Rost\u00f3v went close to the porch, together with some inquisitive civilians, and again, after two years, saw those features he adored: that same face and same look and step, and the same union of majesty and mildness.... And the feeling of enthusiasm and love for his sovereign rose again in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s soul in all its old force. In the uniform of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment\u2014white chamois-leather breeches and high boots\u2014and wearing a star Rost\u00f3v did not know (it was that of the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur), the monarch came out into the porch, putting on his gloves and carrying his hat under his arm. He stopped and looked about him, brightening everything around by his glance. He spoke a few words to some of the generals, and, recognizing the former commander of Rost\u00f3v\u2019s division, smiled and beckoned to him.\n\nAll the suite drew back and Rost\u00f3v saw the general talking for some time to the Emperor.\n\nThe Emperor said a few words to him and took a step toward his horse. Again the crowd of members of the suite and street gazers (among whom was Rost\u00f3v) moved nearer to the Emperor. Stopping beside his horse, with his hand on the saddle, the Emperor turned to the cavalry general and said in a loud voice, evidently wishing to be heard by all:\n\n\u201cI cannot do it, General. I cannot, because the law is stronger than I,\u201d and he raised his foot to the stirrup.\n\nThe general bowed his head respectfully, and the monarch mounted and rode down the street at a gallop. Beside himself with enthusiasm, Rost\u00f3v ran after him with the crowd.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe Emperor rode to the square where, facing one another, a battalion of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment stood on the right and a battalion of the French Guards in their bearskin caps on the left.\n\nAs the Tsar rode up to one flank of the battalions, which presented arms, another group of horsemen galloped up to the opposite flank, and at the head of them Rost\u00f3v recognized Napoleon. It could be no one else. He came at a gallop, wearing a small hat, a blue uniform open over a white vest, and the St. Andrew ribbon over his shoulder. He was riding a very fine thoroughbred gray Arab horse with a crimson gold-embroidered saddlecloth. On approaching Alexander he raised his hat, and as he did so, Rost\u00f3v, with his cavalryman\u2019s eye, could not help noticing that Napoleon did not sit well or firmly in the saddle. The battalions shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d and \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d Napoleon said something to Alexander, and both Emperors dismounted and took each other\u2019s hands. Napoleon\u2019s face wore an unpleasant and artificial smile. Alexander was saying something affable to him.\n\nIn spite of the trampling of the French gendarmes\u2019 horses, which were pushing back the crowd, Rost\u00f3v kept his eyes on every movement of Alexander and Bonaparte. It struck him as a surprise that Alexander treated Bonaparte as an equal and that the latter was quite at ease with the Tsar, as if such relations with an Emperor were an everyday matter to him.\n\nAlexander and Napoleon, with the long train of their suites, approached the right flank of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk battalion and came straight up to the crowd standing there. The crowd unexpectedly found itself so close to the Emperors that Rost\u00f3v, standing in the front row, was afraid he might be recognized.\n\n\u201cSire, I ask your permission to present the Legion of Honor to the bravest of your soldiers,\u201d said a sharp, precise voice, articulating every letter.\n\nThis was said by the undersized Napoleon, looking up straight into Alexander\u2019s eyes. Alexander listened attentively to what was said to him and, bending his head, smiled pleasantly.\n\n\u201cTo him who has borne himself most bravely in this last war,\u201d added Napoleon, accentuating each syllable, as with a composure and assurance exasperating to Rost\u00f3v, he ran his eyes over the Russian ranks drawn up before him, who all presented arms with their eyes fixed on their Emperor.\n\n\u201cWill Your Majesty allow me to consult the colonel?\u201d said Alexander and took a few hasty steps toward Prince Kozl\u00f3vski, the commander of the battalion.\n\nBonaparte meanwhile began taking the glove off his small white hand, tore it in doing so, and threw it away. An aide-de-camp behind him rushed forward and picked it up.\n\n\u201cTo whom shall it be given?\u201d the Emperor Alexander asked Kozl\u00f3vski, in Russian in a low voice.\n\n\u201cTo whomever Your Majesty commands.\u201d\n\nThe Emperor knit his brows with dissatisfaction and, glancing back, remarked:\n\n\u201cBut we must give him an answer.\u201d\n\nKozl\u00f3vski scanned the ranks resolutely and included Rost\u00f3v in his scrutiny.\n\n\u201cCan it be me?\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cL\u00e1zarev!\u201d the colonel called, with a frown, and L\u00e1zarev, the first soldier in the rank, stepped briskly forward.\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to? Stop here!\u201d voices whispered to L\u00e1zarev who did not know where to go. L\u00e1zarev stopped, casting a sidelong look at his colonel in alarm. His face twitched, as often happens to soldiers called before the ranks.\n\nNapoleon slightly turned his head, and put his plump little hand out behind him as if to take something. The members of his suite, guessing at once what he wanted, moved about and whispered as they passed something from one to another, and a page\u2014the same one Rost\u00f3v had seen the previous evening at Bor\u00eds\u2019\u2014ran forward and, bowing respectfully over the outstretched hand and not keeping it waiting a moment, laid in it an Order on a red ribbon. Napoleon, without looking, pressed two fingers together and the badge was between them. Then he approached L\u00e1zarev (who rolled his eyes and persistently gazed at his own monarch), looked round at the Emperor Alexander to imply that what he was now doing was done for the sake of his ally, and the small white hand holding the Order touched one of L\u00e1zarev\u2019s buttons. It was as if Napoleon knew that it was only necessary for his hand to deign to touch that soldier\u2019s breast for the soldier to be forever happy, rewarded, and distinguished from everyone else in the world. Napoleon merely laid the cross on L\u00e1zarev\u2019s breast and, dropping his hand, turned toward Alexander as though sure that the cross would adhere there. And it really did.\n\nOfficious hands, Russian and French, immediately seized the cross and fastened it to the uniform. L\u00e1zarev glanced morosely at the little man with white hands who was doing something to him and, still standing motionless presenting arms, looked again straight into Alexander\u2019s eyes, as if asking whether he should stand there, or go away, or do something else. But receiving no orders, he remained for some time in that rigid position.\n\nThe Emperors remounted and rode away. The Preobrazh\u00e9nsk battalion, breaking rank, mingled with the French Guards and sat down at the tables prepared for them.\n\nL\u00e1zarev sat in the place of honor. Russian and French officers embraced him, congratulated him, and pressed his hands. Crowds of officers and civilians drew near merely to see him. A rumble of Russian and French voices and laughter filled the air round the tables in the square. Two officers with flushed faces, looking cheerful and happy, passed by Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWhat d\u2019you think of the treat? All on silver plate,\u201d one of them was saying. \u201cHave you seen L\u00e1zarev?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have.\u201d\n\n\u201cTomorrow, I hear, the Preobrazh\u00e9nskis will give them a dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but what luck for L\u00e1zarev! Twelve hundred francs\u2019 pension for life.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a cap, lads!\u201d shouted a Preobrazh\u00e9nsk soldier, donning a shaggy French cap.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fine thing! First-rate!\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you heard the password?\u201d asked one Guards\u2019 officer of another. \u201cThe day before yesterday it was \u2018Napol\u00e9on, France, bravoure\u2019; yesterday, \u2018Alexandre, Russie, grandeur.\u2019 One day our Emperor gives it and next day Napoleon. Tomorrow our Emperor will send a St. George\u2019s Cross to the bravest of the French Guards. It has to be done. He must respond in kind.\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds, too, with his friend Zhil\u00ednski, came to see the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk banquet. On his way back, he noticed Rost\u00f3v standing by the corner of a house.\n\n\u201cRost\u00f3v! How d\u2019you do? We missed one another,\u201d he said, and could not refrain from asking what was the matter, so strangely dismal and troubled was Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing,\u201d replied Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll call round?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I will.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v stood at that corner for a long time, watching the feast from a distance. In his mind, a painful process was going on which he could not bring to a conclusion. Terrible doubts rose in his soul. Now he remembered Den\u00edsov with his changed expression, his submission, and the whole hospital, with arms and legs torn off and its dirt and disease. So vividly did he recall that hospital stench of dead flesh that he looked round to see where the smell came from. Next he thought of that self-satisfied Bonaparte, with his small white hand, who was now an Emperor, liked and respected by Alexander. Then why those severed arms and legs and those dead men?... Then again he thought of L\u00e1zarev rewarded and Den\u00edsov punished and unpardoned. He caught himself harboring such strange thoughts that he was frightened.\n\nThe smell of the food the Preobrazh\u00e9nskis were eating and a sense of hunger recalled him from these reflections; he had to get something to eat before going away. He went to a hotel he had noticed that morning. There he found so many people, among them officers who, like himself, had come in civilian clothes, that he had difficulty in getting a dinner. Two officers of his own division joined him. The conversation naturally turned on the peace. The officers, his comrades, like most of the army, were dissatisfied with the peace concluded after the battle of Friedland. They said that had we held out a little longer Napoleon would have been done for, as his troops had neither provisions nor ammunition. Nicholas ate and drank (chiefly the latter) in silence. He finished a couple of bottles of wine by himself. The process in his mind went on tormenting him without reaching a conclusion. He feared to give way to his thoughts, yet could not get rid of them. Suddenly, on one of the officers\u2019 saying that it was humiliating to look at the French, Rost\u00f3v began shouting with uncalled-for wrath, and therefore much to the surprise of the officers:\n\n\u201cHow can you judge what\u2019s best?\u201d he cried, the blood suddenly rushing to his face. \u201cHow can you judge the Emperor\u2019s actions? What right have we to argue? We cannot comprehend either the Emperor\u2019s aims or his actions!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I never said a word about the Emperor!\u201d said the officer, justifying himself, and unable to understand Rost\u00f3v\u2019s outburst, except on the supposition that he was drunk.\n\nBut Rost\u00f3v did not listen to him.\n\n\u201cWe are not diplomatic officials, we are soldiers and nothing more,\u201d he went on. \u201cIf we are ordered to die, we must die. If we\u2019re punished, it means that we have deserved it, it\u2019s not for us to judge. If the Emperor pleases to recognize Bonaparte as Emperor and to conclude an alliance with him, it means that that is the right thing to do. If once we begin judging and arguing about everything, nothing sacred will be left! That way we shall be saying there is no God\u2014nothing!\u201d shouted Nicholas, banging the table\u2014very little to the point as it seemed to his listeners, but quite relevantly to the course of his own thoughts.\n\n\u201cOur business is to do our duty, to fight and not to think! That\u2019s all....\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cAnd to drink,\u201d said one of the officers, not wishing to quarrel.\n\n\u201cYes, and to drink,\u201d assented Nicholas. \u201cHullo there! Another bottle!\u201d he shouted.\n\nIn 1808 the Emperor Alexander went to Erfurt for a fresh interview with the Emperor Napoleon, and in the upper circles of Petersburg there was much talk of the grandeur of this important meeting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nIn 1809 the intimacy between \u201cthe world\u2019s two arbiters,\u201d as Napoleon and Alexander were called, was such that when Napoleon declared war on Austria a Russian corps crossed the frontier to co-operate with our old enemy Bonaparte against our old ally the Emperor of Austria, and in court circles the possibility of marriage between Napoleon and one of Alexander\u2019s sisters was spoken of. But besides considerations of foreign policy, the attention of Russian society was at that time keenly directed on the internal changes that were being undertaken in all the departments of government.\n\nLife meanwhile\u2014real life, with its essential interests of health and sickness, toil and rest, and its intellectual interests in thought, science, poetry, music, love, friendship, hatred, and passions\u2014went on as usual, independently of and apart from political friendship or enmity with Napoleon Bonaparte and from all the schemes of reconstruction.\n\n\n\nBOOK SIX: 1808 - 10\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nPrince Andrew had spent two years continuously in the country.\n\nAll the plans Pierre had attempted on his estates\u2014and constantly changing from one thing to another had never accomplished\u2014were carried out by Prince Andrew without display and without perceptible difficulty.\n\nHe had in the highest degree a practical tenacity which Pierre lacked, and without fuss or strain on his part this set things going.\n\nOn one of his estates the three hundred serfs were liberated and became free agricultural laborers\u2014this being one of the first examples of the kind in Russia. On other estates the serfs\u2019 compulsory labor was commuted for a quitrent. A trained midwife was engaged for Boguch\u00e1rovo at his expense, and a priest was paid to teach reading and writing to the children of the peasants and household serfs.\n\nPrince Andrew spent half his time at Bald Hills with his father and his son, who was still in the care of nurses. The other half he spent in \u201cBoguch\u00e1rovo Cloister,\u201d as his father called Prince Andrew\u2019s estate. Despite the indifference to the affairs of the world he had expressed to Pierre, he diligently followed all that went on, received many books, and to his surprise noticed that when he or his father had visitors from Petersburg, the very vortex of life, these people lagged behind himself\u2014who never left the country\u2014in knowledge of what was happening in home and foreign affairs.\n\nBesides being occupied with his estates and reading a great variety of books, Prince Andrew was at this time busy with a critical survey of our last two unfortunate campaigns, and with drawing up a proposal for a reform of the army rules and regulations.\n\nIn the spring of 1809 he went to visit the Ryaz\u00e1n estates which had been inherited by his son, whose guardian he was.\n\nWarmed by the spring sunshine he sat in the cal\u00e8che looking at the new grass, the first leaves on the birches, and the first puffs of white spring clouds floating across the clear blue sky. He was not thinking of anything, but looked absent-mindedly and cheerfully from side to side.\n\nThey crossed the ferry where he had talked with Pierre the year before. They went through the muddy village, past threshing floors and green fields of winter rye, downhill where snow still lodged near the bridge, uphill where the clay had been liquefied by the rain, past strips of stubble land and bushes touched with green here and there, and into a birch forest growing on both sides of the road. In the forest it was almost hot, no wind could be felt. The birches with their sticky green leaves were motionless, and lilac-colored flowers and the first blades of green grass were pushing up and lifting last year\u2019s leaves. The coarse evergreen color of the small fir trees scattered here and there among the birches was an unpleasant reminder of winter. On entering the forest the horses began to snort and sweated visibly.\n\nPeter the footman made some remark to the coachman; the latter assented. But apparently the coachman\u2019s sympathy was not enough for Peter, and he turned on the box toward his master.\n\n\u201cHow pleasant it is, your excellency!\u201d he said with a respectful smile.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pleasant, your excellency!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d thought Prince Andrew. \u201cOh, the spring, I suppose,\u201d he thought as he turned round. \u201cYes, really everything is green already.... How early! The birches and cherry and alders too are coming out.... But the oaks show no sign yet. Ah, here is one oak!\u201d\n\nAt the edge of the road stood an oak. Probably ten times the age of the birches that formed the forest, it was ten times as thick and twice as tall as they. It was an enormous tree, its girth twice as great as a man could embrace, and evidently long ago some of its branches had been broken off and its bark scarred. With its huge ungainly limbs sprawling unsymmetrically, and its gnarled hands and fingers, it stood an aged, stern, and scornful monster among the smiling birch trees. Only the dead-looking evergreen firs dotted about in the forest, and this oak, refused to yield to the charm of spring or notice either the spring or the sunshine.\n\n\u201cSpring, love, happiness!\u201d this oak seemed to say. \u201cAre you not weary of that stupid, meaningless, constantly repeated fraud? Always the same and always a fraud? There is no spring, no sun, no happiness! Look at those cramped dead firs, ever the same, and at me too, sticking out my broken and barked fingers just where they have grown, whether from my back or my sides: as they have grown so I stand, and I do not believe in your hopes and your lies.\u201d\n\nAs he passed through the forest Prince Andrew turned several times to look at that oak, as if expecting something from it. Under the oak, too, were flowers and grass, but it stood among them scowling, rigid, misshapen, and grim as ever.\n\n\u201cYes, the oak is right, a thousand times right,\u201d thought Prince Andrew. \u201cLet others\u2014the young\u2014yield afresh to that fraud, but we know life, our life is finished!\u201d\n\nA whole sequence of new thoughts, hopeless but mournfully pleasant, rose in his soul in connection with that tree. During this journey he, as it were, considered his life afresh and arrived at his old conclusion, restful in its hopelessness: that it was not for him to begin anything anew\u2014but that he must live out his life, content to do no harm, and not disturbing himself or desiring anything.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nPrince Andrew had to see the Marshal of the Nobility for the district in connection with the affairs of the Ryaz\u00e1n estate of which he was trustee. This Marshal was Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, and in the middle of May Prince Andrew went to visit him.\n\nIt was now hot spring weather. The whole forest was already clothed in green. It was dusty and so hot that on passing near water one longed to bathe.\n\nPrince Andrew, depressed and preoccupied with the business about which he had to speak to the Marshal, was driving up the avenue in the grounds of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house at Otr\u00e1dnoe. He heard merry girlish cries behind some trees on the right and saw a group of girls running to cross the path of his cal\u00e8che. Ahead of the rest and nearer to him ran a dark-haired, remarkably slim, pretty girl in a yellow chintz dress, with a white handkerchief on her head from under which loose locks of hair escaped. The girl was shouting something but, seeing that he was a stranger, ran back laughing without looking at him.\n\nSuddenly, he did not know why, he felt a pang. The day was so beautiful, the sun so bright, everything around so gay, but that slim pretty girl did not know, or wish to know, of his existence and was contented and cheerful in her own separate\u2014probably foolish\u2014but bright and happy life. \u201cWhat is she so glad about? What is she thinking of? Not of the military regulations or of the arrangement of the Ryaz\u00e1n serfs\u2019 quitrents. Of what is she thinking? Why is she so happy?\u201d Prince Andrew asked himself with instinctive curiosity.\n\nIn 1809 Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v was living at Otr\u00e1dnoe just as he had done in former years, that is, entertaining almost the whole province with hunts, theatricals, dinners, and music. He was glad to see Prince Andrew, as he was to see any new visitor, and insisted on his staying the night.\n\nDuring the dull day, in the course of which he was entertained by his elderly hosts and by the more important of the visitors (the old count\u2019s house was crowded on account of an approaching name day), Prince Andrew repeatedly glanced at Nat\u00e1sha, gay and laughing among the younger members of the company, and asked himself each time, \u201cWhat is she thinking about? Why is she so glad?\u201d\n\nThat night, alone in new surroundings, he was long unable to sleep. He read awhile and then put out his candle, but relit it. It was hot in the room, the inside shutters of which were closed. He was cross with the stupid old man (as he called Rost\u00f3v), who had made him stay by assuring him that some necessary documents had not yet arrived from town, and he was vexed with himself for having stayed.\n\nHe got up and went to the window to open it. As soon as he opened the shutters the moonlight, as if it had long been watching for this, burst into the room. He opened the casement. The night was fresh, bright, and very still. Just before the window was a row of pollard trees, looking black on one side and with a silvery light on the other. Beneath the trees grew some kind of lush, wet, bushy vegetation with silver-lit leaves and stems here and there. Farther back beyond the dark trees a roof glittered with dew, to the right was a leafy tree with brilliantly white trunk and branches, and above it shone the moon, nearly at its full, in a pale, almost starless, spring sky. Prince Andrew leaned his elbows on the window ledge and his eyes rested on that sky.\n\nHis room was on the first floor. Those in the rooms above were also awake. He heard female voices overhead.\n\n\u201cJust once more,\u201d said a girlish voice above him which Prince Andrew recognized at once.\n\n\u201cBut when are you coming to bed?\u201d replied another voice.\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t, I can\u2019t sleep, what\u2019s the use? Come now for the last time.\u201d\n\nTwo girlish voices sang a musical passage\u2014the end of some song.\n\n\u201cOh, how lovely! Now go to sleep, and there\u2019s an end of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou go to sleep, but I can\u2019t,\u201d said the first voice, coming nearer to the window. She was evidently leaning right out, for the rustle of her dress and even her breathing could be heard. Everything was stone-still, like the moon and its light and the shadows. Prince Andrew, too, dared not stir, for fear of betraying his unintentional presence.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya! S\u00f3nya!\u201d he again heard the first speaker. \u201cOh, how can you sleep? Only look how glorious it is! Ah, how glorious! Do wake up, S\u00f3nya!\u201d she said almost with tears in her voice. \u201cThere never, never was such a lovely night before!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya made some reluctant reply.\n\n\u201cDo just come and see what a moon!... Oh, how lovely! Come here.... Darling, sweetheart, come here! There, you see? I feel like sitting down on my heels, putting my arms round my knees like this, straining tight, as tight as possible, and flying away! Like this....\u201d\n\n\u201cTake care, you\u2019ll fall out.\u201d\n\nHe heard the sound of a scuffle and S\u00f3nya\u2019s disapproving voice: \u201cIt\u2019s past one o\u2019clock.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you only spoil things for me. All right, go, go!\u201d\n\nAgain all was silent, but Prince Andrew knew she was still sitting there. From time to time he heard a soft rustle and at times a sigh.\n\n\u201cO God, O God! What does it mean?\u201d she suddenly exclaimed. \u201cTo bed then, if it must be!\u201d and she slammed the casement.\n\n\u201cFor her I might as well not exist!\u201d thought Prince Andrew while he listened to her voice, for some reason expecting yet fearing that she might say something about him. \u201cThere she is again! As if it were on purpose,\u201d thought he.\n\nIn his soul there suddenly arose such an unexpected turmoil of youthful thoughts and hopes, contrary to the whole tenor of his life, that unable to explain his condition to himself he lay down and fell asleep at once.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nNext morning, having taken leave of no one but the count, and not waiting for the ladies to appear, Prince Andrew set off for home.\n\nIt was already the beginning of June when on his return journey he drove into the birch forest where the gnarled old oak had made so strange and memorable an impression on him. In the forest the harness bells sounded yet more muffled than they had done six weeks before, for now all was thick, shady, and dense, and the young firs dotted about in the forest did not jar on the general beauty but, lending themselves to the mood around, were delicately green with fluffy young shoots.\n\nThe whole day had been hot. Somewhere a storm was gathering, but only a small cloud had scattered some raindrops lightly, sprinkling the road and the sappy leaves. The left side of the forest was dark in the shade, the right side glittered in the sunlight, wet and shiny and scarcely swayed by the breeze. Everything was in blossom, the nightingales trilled, and their voices reverberated now near, now far away.\n\n\u201cYes, here in this forest was that oak with which I agreed,\u201d thought Prince Andrew. \u201cBut where is it?\u201d he again wondered, gazing at the left side of the road, and without recognizing it he looked with admiration at the very oak he sought. The old oak, quite transfigured, spreading out a canopy of sappy dark-green foliage, stood rapt and slightly trembling in the rays of the evening sun. Neither gnarled fingers nor old scars nor old doubts and sorrows were any of them in evidence now. Through the hard century-old bark, even where there were no twigs, leaves had sprouted such as one could hardly believe the old veteran could have produced.\n\n\u201cYes, it is the same oak,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, and all at once he was seized by an unreasoning springtime feeling of joy and renewal. All the best moments of his life suddenly rose to his memory. Austerlitz with the lofty heavens, his wife\u2019s dead reproachful face, Pierre at the ferry, that girl thrilled by the beauty of the night, and that night itself and the moon, and... all this rushed suddenly to his mind.\n\n\u201cNo, life is not over at thirty-one!\u201d Prince Andrew suddenly decided finally and decisively. \u201cIt is not enough for me to know what I have in me\u2014everyone must know it: Pierre, and that young girl who wanted to fly away into the sky, everyone must know me, so that my life may not be lived for myself alone while others live so apart from it, but so that it may be reflected in them all, and they and I may live in harmony!\u201d\n\n\nOn reaching home Prince Andrew decided to go to Petersburg that autumn and found all sorts of reasons for this decision. A whole series of sensible and logical considerations showing it to be essential for him to go to Petersburg, and even to re-enter the service, kept springing up in his mind. He could not now understand how he could ever even have doubted the necessity of taking an active share in life, just as a month before he had not understood how the idea of leaving the quiet country could ever enter his head. It now seemed clear to him that all his experience of life must be senselessly wasted unless he applied it to some kind of work and again played an active part in life. He did not even remember how formerly, on the strength of similar wretched logical arguments, it had seemed obvious that he would be degrading himself if he now, after the lessons he had had in life, allowed himself to believe in the possibility of being useful and in the possibility of happiness or love. Now reason suggested quite the opposite. After that journey to Ryaz\u00e1n he found the country dull; his former pursuits no longer interested him, and often when sitting alone in his study he got up, went to the mirror, and gazed a long time at his own face. Then he would turn away to the portrait of his dead Lise, who with hair curled \u00e0 la grecque looked tenderly and gaily at him out of the gilt frame. She did not now say those former terrible words to him, but looked simply, merrily, and inquisitively at him. And Prince Andrew, crossing his arms behind him, long paced the room, now frowning, now smiling, as he reflected on those irrational, inexpressible thoughts, secret as a crime, which altered his whole life and were connected with Pierre, with fame, with the girl at the window, the oak, and woman\u2019s beauty and love. And if anyone came into his room at such moments he was particularly cold, stern, and above all unpleasantly logical.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d Princess Mary entering at such a moment would say, \u201clittle Nicholas can\u2019t go out today, it\u2019s very cold.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it were hot,\u201d Prince Andrew would reply at such times very dryly to his sister, \u201che could go out in his smock, but as it is cold he must wear warm clothes, which were designed for that purpose. That is what follows from the fact that it is cold; and not that a child who needs fresh air should remain at home,\u201d he would add with extreme logic, as if punishing someone for those secret illogical emotions that stirred within him.\n\nAt such moments Princess Mary would think how intellectual work dries men up.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPrince Andrew arrived in Petersburg in August, 1809. It was the time when the youthful Sper\u00e1nski was at the zenith of his fame and his reforms were being pushed forward with the greatest energy. That same August the Emperor was thrown from his cal\u00e8che, injured his leg, and remained three weeks at Peterhof, receiving Sper\u00e1nski every day and no one else. At that time the two famous decrees were being prepared that so agitated society\u2014abolishing court ranks and introducing examinations to qualify for the grades of Collegiate Assessor and State Councilor\u2014and not merely these but a whole state constitution, intended to change the existing order of government in Russia: legal, administrative, and financial, from the Council of State down to the district tribunals. Now those vague liberal dreams with which the Emperor Alexander had ascended the throne, and which he had tried to put into effect with the aid of his associates, Czartor\u00fdski, Novos\u00edltsev, Kochub\u00e9y, and Str\u00f3gonov\u2014whom he himself in jest had called his Comit\u00e9 de salut public\u2014were taking shape and being realized.\n\nNow all these men were replaced by Sper\u00e1nski on the civil side, and Arakch\u00e9ev on the military. Soon after his arrival Prince Andrew, as a gentleman of the chamber, presented himself at court and at a levee. The Emperor, though he met him twice, did not favor him with a single word. It had always seemed to Prince Andrew before that he was antipathetic to the Emperor and that the latter disliked his face and personality generally, and in the cold, repellent glance the Emperor gave him, he now found further confirmation of this surmise. The courtiers explained the Emperor\u2019s neglect of him by His Majesty\u2019s displeasure at Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s not having served since 1805.\n\n\u201cI know myself that one cannot help one\u2019s sympathies and antipathies,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cso it will not do to present my proposal for the reform of the army regulations to the Emperor personally, but the project will speak for itself.\u201d\n\nHe mentioned what he had written to an old field marshal, a friend of his father\u2019s. The field marshal made an appointment to see him, received him graciously, and promised to inform the Emperor. A few days later Prince Andrew received notice that he was to go to see the Minister of War, Count Arakch\u00e9ev.\n\n\nOn the appointed day Prince Andrew entered Count Arakch\u00e9ev\u2019s waiting room at nine in the morning.\n\nHe did not know Arakch\u00e9ev personally, had never seen him, and all he had heard of him inspired him with but little respect for the man.\n\n\u201cHe is Minister of War, a man trusted by the Emperor, and I need not concern myself about his personal qualities: he has been commissioned to consider my project, so he alone can get it adopted,\u201d thought Prince Andrew as he waited among a number of important and unimportant people in Count Arakch\u00e9ev\u2019s waiting room.\n\nDuring his service, chiefly as an adjutant, Prince Andrew had seen the anterooms of many important men, and the different types of such rooms were well known to him. Count Arakch\u00e9ev\u2019s anteroom had quite a special character. The faces of the unimportant people awaiting their turn for an audience showed embarrassment and servility; the faces of those of higher rank expressed a common feeling of awkwardness, covered by a mask of unconcern and ridicule of themselves, their situation, and the person for whom they were waiting. Some walked thoughtfully up and down, others whispered and laughed. Prince Andrew heard the nickname \u201cS\u00edla Andr\u00e9evich\u201d and the words, \u201cUncle will give it to us hot,\u201d in reference to Count Arakch\u00e9ev. One general (an important personage), evidently feeling offended at having to wait so long, sat crossing and uncrossing his legs and smiling contemptuously to himself.\n\nBut the moment the door opened one feeling alone appeared on all faces\u2014that of fear. Prince Andrew for the second time asked the adjutant on duty to take in his name, but received an ironical look and was told that his turn would come in due course. After some others had been shown in and out of the minister\u2019s room by the adjutant on duty, an officer who struck Prince Andrew by his humiliated and frightened air was admitted at that terrible door. This officer\u2019s audience lasted a long time. Then suddenly the grating sound of a harsh voice was heard from the other side of the door, and the officer\u2014with pale face and trembling lips\u2014came out and passed through the waiting room, clutching his head.\n\nAfter this Prince Andrew was conducted to the door and the officer on duty said in a whisper, \u201cTo the right, at the window.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew entered a plain tidy room and saw at the table a man of forty with a long waist, a long closely cropped head, deep wrinkles, scowling brows above dull greenish-hazel eyes and an overhanging red nose. Arakch\u00e9ev turned his head toward him without looking at him.\n\n\u201cWhat is your petition?\u201d asked Arakch\u00e9ev.\n\n\u201cI am not petitioning, your excellency,\u201d returned Prince Andrew quietly.\n\nArakch\u00e9ev\u2019s eyes turned toward him.\n\n\u201cSit down,\u201d said he. \u201cPrince Bolk\u00f3nski?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not petitioning about anything. His Majesty the Emperor has deigned to send your excellency a project submitted by me...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, my dear sir, I have read your project,\u201d interrupted Arakch\u00e9ev, uttering only the first words amiably and then\u2014again without looking at Prince Andrew\u2014relapsing gradually into a tone of grumbling contempt. \u201cYou are proposing new military laws? There are many laws but no one to carry out the old ones. Nowadays everybody designs laws, it is easier writing than doing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI came at His Majesty the Emperor\u2019s wish to learn from your excellency how you propose to deal with the memorandum I have presented,\u201d said Prince Andrew politely.\n\n\u201cI have endorsed a resolution on your memorandum and sent it to the committee. I do not approve of it,\u201d said Arakch\u00e9ev, rising and taking a paper from his writing table. \u201cHere!\u201d and he handed it to Prince Andrew.\n\nAcross the paper was scrawled in pencil, without capital letters, misspelled, and without punctuation: \u201cUnsoundly constructed because resembles an imitation of the French military code and from the Articles of War needlessly deviating.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo what committee has the memorandum been referred?\u201d inquired Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cTo the Committee on Army Regulations, and I have recommended that your honor should be appointed a member, but without a salary.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want one.\u201d\n\n\u201cA member without salary,\u201d repeated Arakch\u00e9ev. \u201cI have the honor... Eh! Call the next one! Who else is there?\u201d he shouted, bowing to Prince Andrew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nWhile waiting for the announcement of his appointment to the committee Prince Andrew looked up his former acquaintances, particularly those he knew to be in power and whose aid he might need. In Petersburg he now experienced the same feeling he had had on the eve of a battle, when troubled by anxious curiosity and irresistibly attracted to the ruling circles where the future, on which the fate of millions depended, was being shaped. From the irritation of the older men, the curiosity of the uninitiated, the reserve of the initiated, the hurry and preoccupation of everyone, and the innumerable committees and commissions of whose existence he learned every day, he felt that now, in 1809, here in Petersburg a vast civil conflict was in preparation, the commander in chief of which was a mysterious person he did not know, but who was supposed to be a man of genius\u2014Sper\u00e1nski. And this movement of reconstruction of which Prince Andrew had a vague idea, and Sper\u00e1nski its chief promoter, began to interest him so keenly that the question of the army regulations quickly receded to a secondary place in his consciousness.\n\nPrince Andrew was most favorably placed to secure good reception in the highest and most diverse Petersburg circles of the day. The reforming party cordially welcomed and courted him, in the first place because he was reputed to be clever and very well read, and secondly because by liberating his serfs he had obtained the reputation of being a liberal. The party of the old and dissatisfied, who censured the innovations, turned to him expecting his sympathy in their disapproval of the reforms, simply because he was the son of his father. The feminine society world welcomed him gladly, because he was rich, distinguished, a good match, and almost a newcomer, with a halo of romance on account of his supposed death and the tragic loss of his wife. Besides this the general opinion of all who had known him previously was that he had greatly improved during these last five years, having softened and grown more manly, lost his former affectation, pride, and contemptuous irony, and acquired the serenity that comes with years. People talked about him, were interested in him, and wanted to meet him.\n\nThe day after his interview with Count Arakch\u00e9ev, Prince Andrew spent the evening at Count Kochub\u00e9y\u2019s. He told the count of his interview with S\u00edla Andr\u00e9evich (Kochub\u00e9y spoke of Arakch\u00e9ev by that nickname with the same vague irony Prince Andrew had noticed in the Minister of War\u2019s anteroom).\n\n\u201cMon cher, even in this case you can\u2019t do without Michael Mikh\u00e1ylovich Sper\u00e1nski. He manages everything. I\u2019ll speak to him. He has promised to come this evening.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat has Sper\u00e1nski to do with the army regulations?\u201d asked Prince Andrew.\n\nKochub\u00e9y shook his head smilingly, as if surprised at Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s simplicity.\n\n\u201cWe were talking to him about you a few days ago,\u201d Kochub\u00e9y continued, \u201cand about your freed plowmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, is it you, Prince, who have freed your serfs?\u201d said an old man of Catherine\u2019s day, turning contemptuously toward Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cIt was a small estate that brought in no profit,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, trying to extenuate his action so as not to irritate the old man uselessly.\n\n\u201cAfraid of being late...\u201d said the old man, looking at Kochub\u00e9y.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s one thing I don\u2019t understand,\u201d", "sequence": 10}, {"offset": 1100000, "text": " he continued. \u201cWho will plow the land if they are set free? It is easy to write laws, but difficult to rule.... Just the same as now\u2014I ask you, Count\u2014who will be heads of the departments when everybody has to pass examinations?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose who pass the examinations, I suppose,\u201d replied Kochub\u00e9y, crossing his legs and glancing round.\n\n\u201cWell, I have Pry\u00e1nichnikov serving under me, a splendid man, a priceless man, but he\u2019s sixty. Is he to go up for examination?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s a difficulty, as education is not at all general, but...\u201d\n\nCount Kochub\u00e9y did not finish. He rose, took Prince Andrew by the arm, and went to meet a tall, bald, fair man of about forty with a large open forehead and a long face of unusual and peculiar whiteness, who was just entering. The newcomer wore a blue swallow-tail coat with a cross suspended from his neck and a star on his left breast. It was Sper\u00e1nski. Prince Andrew recognized him at once, and felt a throb within him, as happens at critical moments of life. Whether it was from respect, envy, or anticipation, he did not know. Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s whole figure was of a peculiar type that made him easily recognizable. In the society in which Prince Andrew lived he had never seen anyone who together with awkward and clumsy gestures possessed such calmness and self-assurance; he had never seen so resolute yet gentle an expression as that in those half-closed, rather humid eyes, or so firm a smile that expressed nothing; nor had he heard such a refined, smooth, soft voice; above all he had never seen such delicate whiteness of face or hands\u2014hands which were broad, but very plump, soft, and white. Such whiteness and softness Prince Andrew had only seen on the faces of soldiers who had been long in hospital. This was Sper\u00e1nski, Secretary of State, reporter to the Emperor and his companion at Erfurt, where he had more than once met and talked with Napoleon.\n\nSper\u00e1nski did not shift his eyes from one face to another as people involuntarily do on entering a large company and was in no hurry to speak. He spoke slowly, with assurance that he would be listened to, and he looked only at the person with whom he was conversing.\n\nPrince Andrew followed Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s every word and movement with particular attention. As happens to some people, especially to men who judge those near to them severely, he always on meeting anyone new\u2014especially anyone whom, like Sper\u00e1nski, he knew by reputation\u2014expected to discover in him the perfection of human qualities.\n\nSper\u00e1nski told Kochub\u00e9y he was sorry he had been unable to come sooner as he had been detained at the palace. He did not say that the Emperor had kept him, and Prince Andrew noticed this affectation of modesty. When Kochub\u00e9y introduced Prince Andrew, Sper\u00e1nski slowly turned his eyes to Bolk\u00f3nski with his customary smile and looked at him in silence.\n\n\u201cI am very glad to make your acquaintance. I had heard of you, as everyone has,\u201d he said after a pause.\n\nKochub\u00e9y said a few words about the reception Arakch\u00e9ev had given Bolk\u00f3nski. Sper\u00e1nski smiled more markedly.\n\n\u201cThe chairman of the Committee on Army Regulations is my good friend Monsieur Magn\u00edtski,\u201d he said, fully articulating every word and syllable, \u201cand if you like I can put you in touch with him.\u201d He paused at the full stop. \u201cI hope you will find him sympathetic and ready to co-operate in promoting all that is reasonable.\u201d\n\nA circle soon formed round Sper\u00e1nski, and the old man who had talked about his subordinate Pry\u00e1nichnikov addressed a question to him.\n\nPrince Andrew without joining in the conversation watched every movement of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s: this man, not long since an insignificant divinity student, who now, Bolk\u00f3nski thought, held in his hands\u2014those plump white hands\u2014the fate of Russia. Prince Andrew was struck by the extraordinarily disdainful composure with which Sper\u00e1nski answered the old man. He appeared to address condescending words to him from an immeasurable height. When the old man began to speak too loud, Sper\u00e1nski smiled and said he could not judge of the advantage or disadvantage of what pleased the sovereign.\n\nHaving talked for a little while in the general circle, Sper\u00e1nski rose and coming up to Prince Andrew took him along to the other end of the room. It was clear that he thought it necessary to interest himself in Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cI had no chance to talk with you, Prince, during the animated conversation in which that venerable gentleman involved me,\u201d he said with a mildly contemptuous smile, as if intimating by that smile that he and Prince Andrew understood the insignificance of the people with whom he had just been talking. This flattered Prince Andrew. \u201cI have known of you for a long time: first from your action with regard to your serfs, a first example, of which it is very desirable that there should be more imitators; and secondly because you are one of those gentlemen of the chamber who have not considered themselves offended by the new decree concerning the ranks allotted to courtiers, which is causing so much gossip and tittle-tattle.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Prince Andrew, \u201cmy father did not wish me to take advantage of the privilege. I began the service from the lower grade.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour father, a man of the last century, evidently stands above our contemporaries who so condemn this measure which merely re-establishes natural justice.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think, however, that these condemnations have some ground,\u201d returned Prince Andrew, trying to resist Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s influence, of which he began to be conscious. He did not like to agree with him in everything and felt a wish to contradict. Though he usually spoke easily and well, he felt a difficulty in expressing himself now while talking with Sper\u00e1nski. He was too much absorbed in observing the famous man\u2019s personality.\n\n\u201cGrounds of personal ambition maybe,\u201d Sper\u00e1nski put in quietly.\n\n\u201cAnd of state interest to some extent,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d asked Sper\u00e1nski quietly, lowering his eyes.\n\n\u201cI am an admirer of Montesquieu,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cand his idea that le principe des monarchies est l\u2019honneur me para\u00eet incontestable. Certains droits et privil\u00e8ges de la noblesse me paraissent \u00eatre des moyens de soutenir ce sentiment.\u201d\n\nThe smile vanished from Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s white face, which was much improved by the change. Probably Prince Andrew\u2019s thought interested him.\n\n\u201cSi vous envisagez la question sous ce point de vue,\u201d he began, pronouncing French with evident difficulty, and speaking even slower than in Russian but quite calmly.\n\nSper\u00e1nski went on to say that honor, l\u2019honneur, cannot be upheld by privileges harmful to the service; that honor, l\u2019honneur, is either a negative concept of not doing what is blameworthy or it is a source of emulation in pursuit of commendation and rewards, which recognize it. His arguments were concise, simple, and clear.\n\n\u201cAn institution upholding honor, the source of emulation, is one similar to the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur of the great Emperor Napoleon, not harmful but helpful to the success of the service, but not a class or court privilege.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do not dispute that, but it cannot be denied that court privileges have attained the same end,\u201d returned Prince Andrew. \u201cEvery courtier considers himself bound to maintain his position worthily.\u201d\n\n\u201cYet you do not care to avail yourself of the privilege, Prince,\u201d said Sper\u00e1nski, indicating by a smile that he wished to finish amiably an argument which was embarrassing for his companion. \u201cIf you will do me the honor of calling on me on Wednesday,\u201d he added, \u201cI will, after talking with Magn\u00edtski, let you know what may interest you, and shall also have the pleasure of a more detailed chat with you.\u201d\n\nClosing his eyes, he bowed \u00e0 la fran\u00e7aise, without taking leave, and trying to attract as little attention as possible, he left the room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nDuring the first weeks of his stay in Petersburg Prince Andrew felt the whole trend of thought he had formed during his life of seclusion quite overshadowed by the trifling cares that engrossed him in that city.\n\nOn returning home in the evening he would jot down in his notebook four or five necessary calls or appointments for certain hours. The mechanism of life, the arrangement of the day so as to be in time everywhere, absorbed the greater part of his vital energy. He did nothing, did not even think or find time to think, but only talked, and talked successfully, of what he had thought while in the country.\n\nHe sometimes noticed with dissatisfaction that he repeated the same remark on the same day in different circles. But he was so busy for whole days together that he had no time to notice that he was thinking of nothing.\n\nAs he had done on their first meeting at Kochub\u00e9y\u2019s, Sper\u00e1nski produced a strong impression on Prince Andrew on the Wednesday, when he received him t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate at his own house and talked to him long and confidentially.\n\nTo Bolk\u00f3nski so many people appeared contemptible and insignificant creatures, and he so longed to find in someone the living ideal of that perfection toward which he strove, that he readily believed that in Sper\u00e1nski he had found this ideal of a perfectly rational and virtuous man. Had Sper\u00e1nski sprung from the same class as himself and possessed the same breeding and traditions, Bolk\u00f3nski would soon have discovered his weak, human, unheroic sides; but as it was, Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s strange and logical turn of mind inspired him with respect all the more because he did not quite understand him. Moreover, Sper\u00e1nski, either because he appreciated the other\u2019s capacity or because he considered it necessary to win him to his side, showed off his dispassionate calm reasonableness before Prince Andrew and flattered him with that subtle flattery which goes hand in hand with self-assurance and consists in a tacit assumption that one\u2019s companion is the only man besides oneself capable of understanding the folly of the rest of mankind and the reasonableness and profundity of one\u2019s own ideas.\n\nDuring their long conversation on Wednesday evening, Sper\u00e1nski more than once remarked: \u201cWe regard everything that is above the common level of rooted custom...\u201d or, with a smile: \u201cBut we want the wolves to be fed and the sheep to be safe...\u201d or: \u201cThey cannot understand this...\u201d and all in a way that seemed to say: \u201cWe, you and I, understand what they are and who we are.\u201d\n\nThis first long conversation with Sper\u00e1nski only strengthened in Prince Andrew the feeling he had experienced toward him at their first meeting. He saw in him a remarkable, clear-thinking man of vast intellect who by his energy and persistence had attained power, which he was using solely for the welfare of Russia. In Prince Andrew\u2019s eyes Sper\u00e1nski was the man he would himself have wished to be\u2014one who explained all the facts of life reasonably, considered important only what was rational, and was capable of applying the standard of reason to everything. Everything seemed so simple and clear in Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s exposition that Prince Andrew involuntarily agreed with him about everything. If he replied and argued, it was only because he wished to maintain his independence and not submit to Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s opinions entirely. Everything was right and everything was as it should be: only one thing disconcerted Prince Andrew. This was Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s cold, mirrorlike look, which did not allow one to penetrate to his soul, and his delicate white hands, which Prince Andrew involuntarily watched as one does watch the hands of those who possess power. This mirrorlike gaze and those delicate hands irritated Prince Andrew, he knew not why. He was unpleasantly struck, too, by the excessive contempt for others that he observed in Sper\u00e1nski, and by the diversity of lines of argument he used to support his opinions. He made use of every kind of mental device, except analogy, and passed too boldly, it seemed to Prince Andrew, from one to another. Now he would take up the position of a practical man and condemn dreamers; now that of a satirist, and laugh ironically at his opponents; now grow severely logical, or suddenly rise to the realm of metaphysics. (This last resource was one he very frequently employed.) He would transfer a question to metaphysical heights, pass on to definitions of space, time, and thought, and, having deduced the refutation he needed, would again descend to the level of the original discussion.\n\nIn general the trait of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s mentality which struck Prince Andrew most was his absolute and unshakable belief in the power and authority of reason. It was evident that the thought could never occur to him which to Prince Andrew seemed so natural, namely, that it is after all impossible to express all one thinks; and that he had never felt the doubt, \u201cIs not all I think and believe nonsense?\u201d And it was just this peculiarity of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s mind that particularly attracted Prince Andrew.\n\nDuring the first period of their acquaintance Bolk\u00f3nski felt a passionate admiration for him similar to that which he had once felt for Bonaparte. The fact that Sper\u00e1nski was the son of a village priest, and that stupid people might meanly despise him on account of his humble origin (as in fact many did), caused Prince Andrew to cherish his sentiment for him the more, and unconsciously to strengthen it.\n\nOn that first evening Bolk\u00f3nski spent with him, having mentioned the Commission for the Revision of the Code of Laws, Sper\u00e1nski told him sarcastically that the Commission had existed for a hundred and fifty years, had cost millions, and had done nothing except that Rosenkampf had stuck labels on the corresponding paragraphs of the different codes.\n\n\u201cAnd that is all the state has for the millions it has spent,\u201d said he. \u201cWe want to give the Senate new juridical powers, but we have no laws. That is why it is a sin for men like you, Prince, not to serve in these times!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew said that for that work an education in jurisprudence was needed which he did not possess.\n\n\u201cBut nobody possesses it, so what would you have? It is a vicious circle from which we must break a way out.\u201d\n\nA week later Prince Andrew was a member of the Committee on Army Regulations and\u2014what he had not at all expected\u2014was chairman of a section of the committee for the revision of the laws. At Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s request he took the first part of the Civil Code that was being drawn up and, with the aid of the Code Napol\u00e9on and the Institutes of Justinian, he worked at formulating the section on Personal Rights.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nNearly two years before this, in 1808, Pierre on returning to Petersburg after visiting his estates had involuntarily found himself in a leading position among the Petersburg Freemasons. He arranged dining and funeral lodge meetings, enrolled new members, and busied himself uniting various lodges and acquiring authentic charters. He gave money for the erection of temples and supplemented as far as he could the collection of alms, in regard to which the majority of members were stingy and irregular. He supported almost singlehanded a poorhouse the order had founded in Petersburg.\n\nHis life meanwhile continued as before, with the same infatuations and dissipations. He liked to dine and drink well, and though he considered it immoral and humiliating could not resist the temptations of the bachelor circles in which he moved.\n\nAmid the turmoil of his activities and distractions, however, Pierre at the end of a year began to feel that the more firmly he tried to rest upon it, the more Masonic ground on which he stood gave way under him. At the same time he felt that the deeper the ground sank under him the closer bound he involuntarily became to the order. When he had joined the Freemasons he had experienced the feeling of one who confidently steps onto the smooth surface of a bog. When he put his foot down it sank in. To make quite sure of the firmness of the ground, he put his other foot down and sank deeper still, became stuck in it, and involuntarily waded knee-deep in the bog.\n\nJoseph Alex\u00e9evich was not in Petersburg\u2014he had of late stood aside from the affairs of the Petersburg lodges, and lived almost entirely in Moscow. All the members of the lodges were men Pierre knew in ordinary life, and it was difficult for him to regard them merely as Brothers in Freemasonry and not as Prince B. or Iv\u00e1n Vas\u00edlevich D., whom he knew in society mostly as weak and insignificant men. Under the Masonic aprons and insignia he saw the uniforms and decorations at which they aimed in ordinary life. Often after collecting alms, and reckoning up twenty to thirty rubles received for the most part in promises from a dozen members, of whom half were as well able to pay as himself, Pierre remembered the Masonic vow in which each Brother promised to devote all his belongings to his neighbor, and doubts on which he tried not to dwell arose in his soul.\n\nHe divided the Brothers he knew into four categories. In the first he put those who did not take an active part in the affairs of the lodges or in human affairs, but were exclusively occupied with the mystical science of the order: with questions of the threefold designation of God, the three primordial elements\u2014sulphur, mercury, and salt\u2014or the meaning of the square and all the various figures of the temple of Solomon. Pierre respected this class of Brothers to which the elder ones chiefly belonged, including, Pierre thought, Joseph Alex\u00e9evich himself, but he did not share their interests. His heart was not in the mystical aspect of Freemasonry.\n\nIn the second category Pierre reckoned himself and others like him, seeking and vacillating, who had not yet found in Freemasonry a straight and comprehensible path, but hoped to do so.\n\nIn the third category he included those Brothers (the majority) who saw nothing in Freemasonry but the external forms and ceremonies, and prized the strict performance of these forms without troubling about their purport or significance. Such were Willarski and even the Grand Master of the principal lodge.\n\nFinally, to the fourth category also a great many Brothers belonged, particularly those who had lately joined. These according to Pierre\u2019s observations were men who had no belief in anything, nor desire for anything, but joined the Freemasons merely to associate with the wealthy young Brothers who were influential through their connections or rank, and of whom there were very many in the lodge.\n\nPierre began to feel dissatisfied with what he was doing. Freemasonry, at any rate as he saw it here, sometimes seemed to him based merely on externals. He did not think of doubting Freemasonry itself, but suspected that Russian Masonry had taken a wrong path and deviated from its original principles. And so toward the end of the year he went abroad to be initiated into the higher secrets of the order.\n\nIn the summer of 1809 Pierre returned to Petersburg. Our Freemasons knew from correspondence with those abroad that Bez\u00fakhov had obtained the confidence of many highly placed persons, had been initiated into many mysteries, had been raised to a higher grade, and was bringing back with him much that might conduce to the advantage of the Masonic cause in Russia. The Petersburg Freemasons all came to see him, tried to ingratiate themselves with him, and it seemed to them all that he was preparing something for them and concealing it.\n\nA solemn meeting of the lodge of the second degree was convened, at which Pierre promised to communicate to the Petersburg Brothers what he had to deliver to them from the highest leaders of their order. The meeting was a full one. After the usual ceremonies Pierre rose and began his address.\n\n\u201cDear Brothers,\u201d he began, blushing and stammering, with a written speech in his hand, \u201cit is not sufficient to observe our mysteries in the seclusion of our lodge\u2014we must act\u2014act! We are drowsing, but we must act.\u201d Pierre raised his notebook and began to read.\n\n\u201cFor the dissemination of pure truth and to secure the triumph of virtue,\u201d he read, \u201cwe must cleanse men from prejudice, diffuse principles in harmony with the spirit of the times, undertake the education of the young, unite ourselves in indissoluble bonds with the wisest men, boldly yet prudently overcome superstitions, infidelity, and folly, and form of those devoted to us a body linked together by unity of purpose and possessed of authority and power.\n\n\u201cTo attain this end we must secure a preponderance of virtue over vice and must endeavor to secure that the honest man may, even in this world, receive a lasting reward for his virtue. But in these great endeavors we are gravely hampered by the political institutions of today. What is to be done in these circumstances? To favor revolutions, overthrow everything, repel force by force?... No! We are very far from that. Every violent reform deserves censure, for it quite fails to remedy evil while men remain what they are, and also because wisdom needs no violence.\n\n\u201cThe whole plan of our order should be based on the idea of preparing men of firmness and virtue bound together by unity of conviction\u2014aiming at the punishment of vice and folly, and patronizing talent and virtue: raising worthy men from the dust and attaching them to our Brotherhood. Only then will our order have the power unobtrusively to bind the hands of the protectors of disorder and to control them without their being aware of it. In a word, we must found a form of government holding universal sway, which should be diffused over the whole world without destroying the bonds of citizenship, and beside which all other governments can continue in their customary course and do everything except what impedes the great aim of our order, which is to obtain for virtue the victory over vice. This aim was that of Christianity itself. It taught men to be wise and good and for their own benefit to follow the example and instruction of the best and wisest men.\n\n\u201cAt that time, when everything was plunged in darkness, preaching alone was of course sufficient. The novelty of Truth endowed her with special strength, but now we need much more powerful methods. It is now necessary that man, governed by his senses, should find in virtue a charm palpable to those senses. It is impossible to eradicate the passions; but we must strive to direct them to a noble aim, and it is therefore necessary that everyone should be able to satisfy his passions within the limits of virtue. Our order should provide means to that end.\n\n\u201cAs soon as we have a certain number of worthy men in every state, each of them again training two others and all being closely united, everything will be possible for our order, which has already in secret accomplished much for the welfare of mankind.\u201d\n\nThis speech not only made a strong impression, but created excitement in the lodge. The majority of the Brothers, seeing in it dangerous designs of Illuminism, met it with a coldness that surprised Pierre. The Grand Master began answering him, and Pierre began developing his views with more and more warmth. It was long since there had been so stormy a meeting. Parties were formed, some accusing Pierre of Illuminism, others supporting him. At that meeting he was struck for the first time by the endless variety of men\u2019s minds, which prevents a truth from ever presenting itself identically to two persons. Even those members who seemed to be on his side understood him in their own way with limitations and alterations he could not agree to, as what he always wanted most was to convey his thought to others just as he himself understood it.\n\nAt the end of the meeting the Grand Master with irony and ill-will reproved Bez\u00fakhov for his vehemence and said it was not love of virtue alone, but also a love of strife that had moved him in the dispute. Pierre did not answer him and asked briefly whether his proposal would be accepted. He was told that it would not, and without waiting for the usual formalities he left the lodge and went home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAgain Pierre was overtaken by the depression he so dreaded. For three days after the delivery of his speech at the lodge he lay on a sofa at home receiving no one and going nowhere.\n\nIt was just then that he received a letter from his wife, who implored him to see her, telling him how grieved she was about him and how she wished to devote her whole life to him.\n\nAt the end of the letter she informed him that in a few days she would return to Petersburg from abroad.\n\nFollowing this letter one of the Masonic Brothers whom Pierre respected less than the others forced his way in to see him and, turning the conversation upon Pierre\u2019s matrimonial affairs, by way of fraternal advice expressed the opinion that his severity to his wife was wrong and that he was neglecting one of the first rules of Freemasonry by not forgiving the penitent.\n\nAt the same time his mother-in-law, Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s wife, sent to him imploring him to come if only for a few minutes to discuss a most important matter. Pierre saw that there was a conspiracy against him and that they wanted to reunite him with his wife, and in the mood he then was, this was not even unpleasant to him. Nothing mattered to him. Nothing in life seemed to him of much importance, and under the influence of the depression that possessed him he valued neither his liberty nor his resolution to punish his wife.\n\n\u201cNo one is right and no one is to blame; so she too is not to blame,\u201d he thought.\n\nIf he did not at once give his consent to a reunion with his wife, it was only because in his state of depression he did not feel able to take any step. Had his wife come to him, he would not have turned her away. Compared to what preoccupied him, was it not a matter of indifference whether he lived with his wife or not?\n\nWithout replying either to his wife or his mother-in-law, Pierre late one night prepared for a journey and started for Moscow to see Joseph Alex\u00e9evich. This is what he noted in his diary:\n\nMoscow, 17th November\n\nI have just returned from my benefactor, and hasten to write down what I have experienced. Joseph Alex\u00e9evich is living poorly and has for three years been suffering from a painful disease of the bladder. No one has ever heard him utter a groan or a word of complaint. From morning till late at night, except when he eats his very plain food, he is working at science. He received me graciously and made me sit down on the bed on which he lay. I made the sign of the Knights of the East and of Jerusalem, and he responded in the same manner, asking me with a mild smile what I had learned and gained in the Prussian and Scottish lodges. I told him everything as best I could, and told him what I had proposed to our Petersburg lodge, of the bad reception I had encountered, and of my rupture with the Brothers. Joseph Alex\u00e9evich, having remained silent and thoughtful for a good while, told me his view of the matter, which at once lit up for me my whole past and the future path I should follow. He surprised me by asking whether I remembered the threefold aim of the order: (1) The preservation and study of the mystery. (2) The purification and reformation of oneself for its reception, and (3) The improvement of the human race by striving for such purification. Which is the principal aim of these three? Certainly self-reformation and self-purification. Only to this aim can we always strive independently of circumstances. But at the same time just this aim demands the greatest efforts of us; and so, led astray by pride, losing sight of this aim, we occupy ourselves either with the mystery which in our impurity we are unworthy to receive, or seek the reformation of the human race while ourselves setting an example of baseness and profligacy. Illuminism is not a pure doctrine, just because it is attracted by social activity and puffed up by pride. On this ground Joseph Alex\u00e9evich condemned my speech and my whole activity, and in the depth of my soul I agreed with him. Talking of my family affairs he said to me, \u201cthe chief duty of a true Mason, as I have told you, lies in perfecting himself. We often think that by removing all the difficulties of our life we shall more quickly reach our aim, but on the contrary, my dear sir, it is only in the midst of worldly cares that we can attain our three chief aims: (1) Self-knowledge\u2014for man can only know himself by comparison, (2) Self-perfecting, which can only be attained by conflict, and (3) The attainment of the chief virtue\u2014love of death. Only the vicissitudes of life can show us its vanity and develop our innate love of death or of rebirth to a new life.\u201d These words are all the more remarkable because, in spite of his great physical sufferings, Joseph Alex\u00e9evich is never weary of life though he loves death, for which\u2014in spite of the purity and loftiness of his inner man\u2014he does not yet feel himself sufficiently prepared. My benefactor then explained to me fully the meaning of the Great Square of creation and pointed out to me that the numbers three and seven are the basis of everything. He advised me not to avoid intercourse with the Petersburg Brothers, but to take up only second-grade posts in the lodge, to try, while diverting the Brothers from pride, to turn them toward the true path self-knowledge and self-perfecting. Besides this he advised me for myself personally above all to keep a watch over myself, and to that end he gave me a notebook, the one I am now writing in and in which I will in future note down all my actions.\n\nPetersburg, 23rd November\n\nI am again living with my wife. My mother-in-law came to me in tears and said that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was here and that she implored me to hear her; that she was innocent and unhappy at my desertion, and much more. I knew that if I once let myself see her I should not have strength to go on refusing what she wanted. In my perplexity I did not know whose aid and advice to seek. Had my benefactor been here he would have told me what to do. I went to my room and reread Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s letters and recalled my conversations with him, and deduced from it all that I ought not to refuse a supplicant, and ought to reach a helping hand to everyone\u2014especially to one so closely bound to me\u2014and that I must bear my cross. But if I forgive her for the sake of doing right, then let union with her have only a spiritual aim. That is what I decided, and what I wrote to Joseph Alex\u00e9evich. I told my wife that I begged her to forget the past, to forgive me whatever wrong I may have done her, and that I had nothing to forgive. It gave me joy to tell her this. She need not know how hard it was for me to see her again. I have settled on the upper floor of this big house and am experiencing a happy feeling of regeneration.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nAt that time, as always happens, the highest society that met at court and at the grand balls was divided into several circles, each with its own particular tone. The largest of these was the French circle of the Napoleonic alliance, the circle of Count Rumy\u00e1ntsev and Caulaincourt. In this group H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, as soon as she had settled in Petersburg with her husband, took a very prominent place. She was visited by the members of the French embassy and by many belonging to that circle and noted for their intellect and polished manners.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne had been at Erfurt during the famous meeting of the Emperors and had brought from there these connections with the Napoleonic notabilities. At Erfurt her success had been brilliant. Napoleon himself had noticed her in the theater and said of her: \u201cC\u2019est un superbe animal.\u201d Her success as a beautiful and elegant woman did not surprise Pierre, for she had become even handsomer than before. What did surprise him was that during these last two years his wife had succeeded in gaining the reputation \u201cd\u2019 une femme charmante, aussi spirituelle que belle.\u201d The distinguished Prince de Ligne wrote her eight-page letters. Bil\u00edbin saved up his epigrams to produce them in Countess Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s presence. To be received in the Countess Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s salon was regarded as a diploma of intellect. Young men read books before attending H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s evenings, to have something to say in her salon, and secretaries of the embassy, and even ambassadors, confided diplomatic secrets to her, so that in a way H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was a power. Pierre, who knew she was very stupid, sometimes attended, with a strange feeling of perplexity and fear, her evenings and dinner parties, where politics, poetry, and philosophy were discussed. At these parties his feelings were like those of a conjuror who always expects his trick to be found out at any moment. But whether because stupidity was just what was needed to run such a salon, or because those who were deceived found pleasure in the deception, at any rate it remained unexposed and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s reputation as a lovely and clever woman became so firmly established that she could say the emptiest and stupidest things and everybody would go into raptures over every word of hers and look for a profound meaning in it of which she herself had no conception.\n\nPierre was just the husband needed for a brilliant society woman. He was that absent-minded crank, a grand seigneur husband who was in no one\u2019s way, and far from spoiling the high tone and general impression of the drawing room, he served, by the contrast he presented to her, as an advantageous background to his elegant and tactful wife. Pierre during the last two years, as a result of his continual absorption in abstract interests and his sincere contempt for all else, had acquired in his wife\u2019s circle, which did not interest him, that air of unconcern, indifference, and benevolence toward all, which cannot be acquired artificially and therefore inspires involuntary respect. He entered his wife\u2019s drawing room as one enters a theater, was acquainted with everybody, equally pleased to see everyone, and equally indifferent to them all. Sometimes he joined in a conversation which interested him and, regardless of whether any \u201cgentlemen of the embassy\u201d were present or not, lispingly expressed his views, which were sometimes not at all in accord with the accepted tone of the moment. But the general opinion concerning the queer husband of \u201cthe most distinguished woman in Petersburg\u201d was so well established that no one took his freaks seriously.\n\nAmong the many young men who frequented her house every day, Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, who had already achieved great success in the service, was the most intimate friend of the Bez\u00fakhov household since H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s return from Erfurt. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne spoke of him as \u201cmon page\u201d and treated him like a child. Her smile for him was the same as for everybody, but sometimes that smile made Pierre uncomfortable. Toward him Bor\u00eds behaved with a particularly dignified and sad deference. This shade of deference also disturbed Pierre. He had suffered so painfully three years before from the mortification to which his wife had subjected him that he now protected himself from the danger of its repetition, first by not being a husband to his wife, and secondly by not allowing himself to suspect.\n\n\u201cNo, now that she has become a bluestocking she has finally renounced her former infatuations,\u201d he told himself. \u201cThere has never been an instance of a bluestocking being carried away by affairs of the heart\u201d\u2014a statement which, though gathered from an unknown source, he believed implicitly. Yet strange to say Bor\u00eds\u2019 presence in his wife\u2019s drawing room (and he was almost always there) had a physical effect upon Pierre; it constricted his limbs and destroyed the unconsciousness and freedom of his movements.\n\n\u201cWhat a strange antipathy,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cyet I used to like him very much.\u201d\n\nIn the eyes of the world Pierre was a great gentleman, the rather blind and absurd husband of a distinguished wife, a clever crank who did nothing but harmed nobody and was a first-rate, good-natured fellow. But a complex and difficult process of internal development was taking place all this time in Pierre\u2019s soul, revealing much to him and causing him many spiritual doubts and joys.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nPierre went on with his diary, and this is what he wrote in it during that time:\n\n\n24th November\n\nGot up at eight, read the Scriptures, then went to my duties. (By Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s advice Pierre had entered the service of the state and served on one of the committees.) Returned home for dinner and dined alone\u2014the countess had many visitors I do not like. I ate and drank moderately and after dinner copied out some passages for the Brothers. In the evening I went down to the countess and told a funny story about B., and only remembered that I ought not to have done so when everybody laughed loudly at it.\n\nI am going to bed with a happy and tranquil mind. Great God, help me to walk in Thy paths, (1) to conquer anger by calmness and deliberation, (2) to vanquish lust by self-restraint and repulsion, (3) to withdraw from worldliness, but not avoid (a) the service of the state, (b) family duties, (c) relations with my friends, and the management of my affairs.\n\n\n27th November\n\nI got up late. On waking I lay long in bed yielding to sloth. O God, help and strengthen me that I may walk in Thy ways! Read the Scriptures, but without proper feeling. Brother Ur\u00fasov came and we talked about worldly vanities. He told me of the Emperor\u2019s new projects. I began to criticize them, but remembered my rules and my benefactor\u2019s words\u2014that a true Freemason should be a zealous worker for the state when his aid is required and a quiet onlooker when not called on to assist. My tongue is my enemy. Brothers G. V. and O. visited me and we had a preliminary talk about the reception of a new Brother. They laid on me the duty of Rhetor. I feel myself weak and unworthy. Then our talk turned to the interpretation of the seven pillars and steps of the Temple, the seven sciences, the seven virtues, the seven vices, and the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. Brother O. was very eloquent. In the evening the admission took place. The new decoration of the Premises contributed much to the magnificence of the spectacle. It was Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y who was admitted. I nominated him and was the Rhetor. A strange feeling agitated me all the time I was alone with him in the dark chamber. I caught myself harboring a feeling of hatred toward him which I vainly tried to overcome. That is why I should really like to save him from evil and lead him into the path of truth, but evil thoughts of him did not leave me. It seemed to me that his object in entering the Brotherhood was merely to be intimate and in favor with members of our lodge. Apart from the fact that he had asked me several times whether N. and S. were members of our lodge (a question to which I could not reply) and that according to my observation he is incapable of feeling respect for our holy order and is too preoccupied and satisfied with the outer man to desire spiritual improvement, I had no cause to doubt him, but he seemed to me insincere, and all the time I stood alone with him in the dark temple it seemed to me that he was smiling contemptuously at my words, and I wished really to stab his bare breast with the sword I held to it. I could not be eloquent, nor could I frankly mention my doubts to the Brothers and to the Grand Master. Great Architect of Nature, help me to find the true path out of the labyrinth of lies!\n\n\nAfter this, three pages were left blank in the diary, and then the following was written:\n\n\nI have had a long and instructive talk alone with Brother V., who advised me to hold fast by Brother A. Though I am unworthy, much was revealed to me. Adonai is the name of the creator of the world. Elohim is the name of the ruler of all. The third name is the name unutterable which means the All. Talks with Brother V. strengthen, refresh, and support me in the path of virtue. In his presence doubt has no place. The distinction between the poor teachings of mundane science and our sacred all-embracing teaching is clear to me. Human sciences dissect everything to comprehend it, and kill everything to examine it. In the holy science of our order all is one, all is known in its entirety and life. The Trinity\u2014the three elements of matter\u2014are sulphur, mercury, and salt. Sulphur is of an oily and fiery nature; in combination with salt by its fiery nature it arouses a desire in the latter by means of which it attracts mercury, seizes it, holds it, and in combination produces other bodies. Mercury is a fluid, volatile, spiritual essence. Christ, the Holy Spirit, Him!...\n\n\n3rd December\n\nAwoke late, read the Scriptures but was apathetic. Afterwards went and paced up and down the large hall. I wished to meditate, but instead my imagination pictured an occurrence of four years ago, when D\u00f3lokhov, meeting me in Moscow after our duel, said he hoped I was enjoying perfect peace of mind in spite of my wife\u2019s absence. At the time I gave him no answer. Now I recalled every detail of that meeting and in my mind gave him the most malevolent and bitter replies. I recollected myself and drove away that thought only when I found myself glowing with anger, but I did not sufficiently repent. Afterwards Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y came and began relating various adventures. His coming vexed me from the first, and I said something disagreeable to him. He replied. I flared up and said much that was unpleasant and even rude to him. He became silent, and I recollected myself only when it was too late. My God, I cannot get on with him at all. The cause of this is my egotism. I set myself above him and so become much worse than he, for he is lenient to my rudeness while I on the contrary nourish contempt for him. O God, grant that in his presence I may rather see my own vileness, and behave so that he too may benefit. After dinner I fell asleep and as I was drowsing off I clearly heard a voice saying in my left ear, \u201cThy day!\u201d\n\nI dreamed that I was walking in the dark and was suddenly surrounded by dogs, but I went on undismayed. Suddenly a smallish dog seized my left thigh with its teeth and would not let go. I began to throttle it with my hands. Scarcely had I torn it off before another, a bigger one, began biting me. I lifted it up, but the higher I lifted it the bigger and heavier it grew. And suddenly Brother A. came and, taking my arm, led me to a building to enter which we had to pass along a narrow plank. I stepped on it, but it bent and gave way and I began to clamber up a fence which I could scarcely reach with my hands. After much effort I dragged myself up, so that my leg hung down on one side and my body on the other. I looked round and saw Brother A. standing on the fence and pointing me to a broad avenue and garden, and in the garden was a large and beautiful building. I woke up. O Lord, great Architect of Nature, help me to tear from myself these dogs\u2014my passions especially the last, which unites in itself the strength of all the former ones, and aid me to enter that temple of virtue to a vision of which I attained in my dream.\n\n\n7th December\n\nI dreamed that Joseph Alex\u00e9evich was sitting in my house, and that I was very glad and wished to entertain him. It seemed as if I chattered incessantly with other people and suddenly remembered that this could not please him, and I wished to come close to him and embrace him. But as soon as I drew near I saw that his face had changed and grown young, and he was quietly telling me something about the teaching of our order, but so softly that I could not hear it. Then it seemed that we all left the room and something strange happened. We were sitting or lying on the floor. He was telling me something, and I wished to show him my sensibility, and not listening to what he was saying I began picturing to myself the condition of my inner man and the grace of God sanctifying me. And tears came into my eyes, and I was glad he noticed this. But he looked at me with vexation and jumped up, breaking off his remarks. I felt abashed and asked whether what he had been saying did not concern me; but he did not reply, gave me a kind look, and then we suddenly found ourselves in my bedroom where there is a double bed. He lay down on the edge of it and I burned with longing to caress him and lie down too. And he said, \u201cTell me frankly what is your chief temptation? Do you know it? I think you know it already.\u201d Abashed by this question, I replied that sloth was my chief temptation. He shook his head incredulously; and even more abashed, I said that though I was living with my wife as he advised, I was not living with her as her husband. To this he replied that one should not deprive a wife of one\u2019s embraces and gave me to understand that that was my duty. But I replied that I should be ashamed to do it, and suddenly everything vanished. And I awoke and found in my mind the text from the Gospel: \u201cThe life was the light of men. And the light shineth in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not.\u201d Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s face had looked young and bright. That day I received a letter from my benefactor in which he wrote about \u201cconjugal duties.\u201d\n\n\n9th December\n\nI had a dream from which I awoke with a throbbing heart. I saw that I was in Moscow in my house, in the big sitting room, and Joseph Alex\u00e9evich came in from the drawing room. I seemed to know at once that the process of regeneration had already taken place in him, and I rushed to meet him. I embraced him and kissed his hands, and he said, \u201cHast thou noticed that my face is different?\u201d I looked at him, still holding him in my arms, and saw that his face was young, but that he had no hair on his head and his features were quite changed. And I said, \u201cI should have known you had I met you by chance,\u201d and I thought to myself, \u201cAm I telling the truth?\u201d And suddenly I saw him lying like a dead body; then he gradually recovered and went with me into my study carrying a large book of sheets of drawing paper; I said, \u201cI drew that,\u201d and he answered by bowing his head. I opened the book, and on all the pages there were excellent drawings. And in my dream I knew that these drawings represented the love adventures of the soul with its beloved. And on its pages I saw a beautiful representation of a maiden in transparent garments and with a transparent body, flying up to the clouds. And I seemed to know that this maiden was nothing else than a representation of the Song of Songs. And looking at those drawings I dreamed I felt that I was doing wrong, but could not tear myself away from them. Lord, help me! My God, if Thy forsaking me is Thy doing, Thy will be done; but if I am myself the cause, teach me what I should do! I shall perish of my debauchery if Thou utterly desertest me!\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 monetary affairs had not improved during the two years they had spent in the country.\n\nThough Nicholas Rost\u00f3v had kept firmly to his resolution and was still serving modestly in an obscure regiment, spending comparatively little, the way of life at Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014M\u00edtenka\u2019s management of affairs, in particular\u2014was such that the debts inevitably increased every year. The only resource obviously presenting itself to the old count was to apply for an official post, so he had come to Petersburg to look for one and also, as he said, to let the lassies enjoy themselves for the last time.\n\nSoon after their arrival in Petersburg Berg proposed to V\u00e9ra and was accepted.\n\nThough in Moscow the Rost\u00f3vs belonged to the best society without themselves giving it a thought, yet in Petersburg their circle of acquaintances was a mixed and indefinite one. In Petersburg they were provincials, and the very people they had entertained in Moscow without inquiring to what set they belonged, here looked down on them.\n\nThe Rost\u00f3vs lived in the same hospitable way in Petersburg as in Moscow, and the most diverse people met at their suppers. Country neighbors from Otr\u00e1dnoe, impoverished old squires and their daughters, Per\u00f3nskaya a maid of honor, Pierre Bez\u00fakhov, and the son of their district postmaster who had obtained a post in Petersburg. Among the men who very soon became frequent visitors at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house in Petersburg were Bor\u00eds, Pierre whom the count had met in the street and dragged home with him, and Berg who spent whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and paid the eldest daughter, Countess V\u00e9ra, the attentions a young man pays when he intends to propose.\n\nNot in vain had Berg shown everybody his right hand wounded at Austerlitz and held a perfectly unnecessary sword in his left. He narrated that episode so persistently and with so important an air that everyone believed in the merit and usefulness of his deed, and he had obtained two decorations for Austerlitz.\n\nIn the Finnish war he also managed to distinguish himself. He had picked up the scrap of a grenade that had killed an aide-de-camp standing near the commander in chief and had taken it to his commander. Just as he had done after Austerlitz, he related this occurrence at such length and so insistently that everyone again believed it had been necessary to do this, and he received two decorations for the Finnish war also. In 1809 he was a captain in the Guards, wore medals, and held some special lucrative posts in Petersburg.\n\nThough some skeptics smiled when told of Berg\u2019s merits, it could not be denied that he was a painstaking and brave officer, on excellent terms with his superiors, and a moral young man with a brilliant career before him and an assured position in society.\n\nFour years before, meeting a German comrade in the stalls of a Moscow theater, Berg had pointed out V\u00e9ra Rost\u00f3va to him and had said in German, \u201cdas soll mein Weib werden,\u201d and from that moment had made up his mind to marry her. Now in Petersburg, having considered the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 position and his own, he decided that the time had come to propose.\n\nBerg\u2019s proposal was at first received with a perplexity that was not flattering to him. At first it seemed strange that the son of an obscure Livonian gentleman should propose marriage to a Countess Rost\u00f3va; but Berg\u2019s chief characteristic was such a na\u00efve and good natured egotism that the Rost\u00f3vs involuntarily came to think it would be a good thing, since he himself was so firmly convinced that it was good, indeed excellent. Moreover, the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 affairs were seriously embarrassed, as the suitor could not but know; and above all, V\u00e9ra was twenty-four, had been taken out everywhere, and though she was certainly good-looking and sensible, no one up to now had proposed to her. So they gave their consent.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d said Berg to his comrade, whom he called \u201cfriend\u201d only because he knew that everyone has friends, \u201cyou see, I have considered it all, and should not marry if I had not thought it all out or if it were in any way unsuitable. But on the contrary, my papa and mamma are now provided for\u2014I have arranged that rent for them in the Baltic Provinces\u2014and I can live in Petersburg on my pay, and with her fortune and my good management we can get along nicely. I am not marrying for money\u2014I consider that dishonorable\u2014but a wife should bring her share and a husband his. I have my position in the service, she has connections and some means. In our times that is worth something, isn\u2019t it? But above all, she is a handsome, estimable girl, and she loves me....\u201d\n\nBerg blushed and smiled.\n\n\u201cAnd I love her, because her character is sensible and very good. Now the other sister, though they are the same family, is quite different\u2014an unpleasant character and has not the same intelligence. She is so... you know?... Unpleasant... But my fianc\u00e9e!... Well, you will be coming,\u201d he was going to say, \u201cto dine,\u201d but changed his mind and said \u201cto take tea with us,\u201d and quickly doubling up his tongue he blew a small round ring of tobacco smoke, perfectly embodying his dream of happiness.\n\nAfter the first feeling of perplexity aroused in the parents by Berg\u2019s proposal, the holiday tone of joyousness usual at such times took possession of the family, but the rejoicing was external and insincere. In the family\u2019s feeling toward this wedding a certain awkwardness and constraint was evident, as if they were ashamed of not having loved V\u00e9ra sufficiently and of being so ready to get her off their hands. The old count felt this most. He would probably have been unable to state the cause of his embarrassment, but it resulted from the state of his affairs. He did not know at all how much he had, what his debts amounted to, or what dowry he could give V\u00e9ra. When his daughters were born he had assigned to each of them, for her dowry, an estate with three hundred serfs; but one of these estates had already been sold, and the other was mortgaged and the interest so much in arrears that it would have to be sold, so that it was impossible to give it to V\u00e9ra. Nor had he any money.\n\nBerg had already been engaged a month, and only a week remained before the wedding, but the count had not yet decided in his own mind the question of the dowry, nor spoken to his wife about it. At one time the count thought of giving her the Ryaz\u00e1n estate or of selling a forest, at another time of borrowing money on a note of hand. A few days before the wedding Berg entered the count\u2019s study early one morning and, with a pleasant smile, respectfully asked his future father-in-law to let him know what V\u00e9ra\u2019s dowry would be. The count was so disconcerted by this long-foreseen inquiry that without consideration he gave the first reply that came into his head. \u201cI like your being businesslike about it.... I like it. You shall be satisfied....\u201d\n\nAnd patting Berg on the shoulder he got up, wishing to end the conversation. But Berg, smiling pleasantly, explained that if he did not know for certain how much V\u00e9ra would have and did not receive at least part of the dowry in advance, he would have to break matters off.\n\n\u201cBecause, consider, Count\u2014if I allowed myself to marry now without having definite means to maintain my wife, I should be acting badly....\u201d\n\nThe conversation ended by the count, who wished to be generous and to avoid further importunity, saying that he would give a note of hand for eighty thousand rubles. Berg smiled meekly, kissed the count on the shoulder, and said that he was very grateful, but that it was impossible for him to arrange his new life without receiving thirty thousand in ready money. \u201cOr at least twenty thousand, Count,\u201d he added, \u201cand then a note of hand for only sixty thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, all right!\u201d said the count hurriedly. \u201cOnly excuse me, my dear fellow, I\u2019ll give you twenty thousand and a note of hand for eighty thousand as well. Yes, yes! Kiss me.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nNat\u00e1sha was sixteen and it was the year 1809, the very year to which she had counted on her fingers with Bor\u00eds after they had kissed four years ago. Since then she had not seen him. Before S\u00f3nya and her mother, if Bor\u00eds happened to be mentioned, she spoke quite freely of that episode as of some childish, long-forgotten matter that was not worth mentioning. But in the secret depths of her soul the question whether her engagement to Bor\u00eds was a jest or an important, binding promise tormented her.\n\nSince Bor\u00eds left Moscow in 1805 to join the army he had not seen the Rost\u00f3vs. He had been in Moscow several times, and had passed near Otr\u00e1dnoe, but had never been to see them.\n\nSometimes it occurred to Nat\u00e1sha that he did not wish to see her, and this conjecture was confirmed by the sad tone in which her elders spoke of him.\n\n\u201cNowadays old friends are not remembered,\u201d the countess would say when Bor\u00eds was mentioned.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna also had of late visited them less frequently, seemed to hold herself with particular dignity, and always spoke rapturously and gratefully of the merits of her son and the brilliant career on which he had entered. When the Rost\u00f3vs came to Petersburg Bor\u00eds called on them.\n\nHe drove to their house in some agitation. The memory of Nat\u00e1sha was his most poetic recollection. But he went with the firm intention of letting her and her parents feel that the childish relations between himself and Nat\u00e1sha could not be binding either on her or on him. He had a brilliant position in society thanks to his intimacy with Countess Bez\u00fakhova, a brilliant position in the service thanks to the patronage of an important personage whose complete confidence he enjoyed, and he was beginning to make plans for marrying one of the richest heiresses in Petersburg, plans which might very easily be realized. When he entered the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 drawing room Nat\u00e1sha was in her own room. When she heard of his arrival she almost ran into the drawing room, flushed and beaming with a more than cordial smile.\n\nBor\u00eds remembered Nat\u00e1sha in a short dress, with dark eyes shining from under her curls and boisterous, childish laughter, as he had known her four years before; and so he was taken aback when quite a different Nat\u00e1sha entered, and his face expressed rapturous astonishment. This expression on his face pleased Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cWell, do you recognize your little madcap playmate?\u201d asked the countess.\n\nBor\u00eds kissed Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s hand and said that he was astonished at the change in her.\n\n\u201cHow handsome you have grown!\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think so!\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s laughing eyes.\n\n\u201cAnd is Papa older?\u201d she asked.\n\nNat\u00e1sha sat down and, without joining in Bor\u00eds\u2019 conversation with the countess, silently and minutely studied her childhood\u2019s suitor. He felt the weight of that resolute and affectionate scrutiny and glanced at her occasionally.\n\nBor\u00eds\u2019 uniform, spurs, tie, and the way his hair was brushed were all comme il faut and in the latest fashion. This Nat\u00e1sha noticed at once. He sat rather sideways in the armchair next to the countess, arranging with his right hand the cleanest of gloves that fitted his left hand like a skin, and he spoke with a particularly refined compression of his lips about the amusements of the highest Petersburg society, recalling with mild irony old times in Moscow and Moscow acquaintances. It was not accidentally, Nat\u00e1sha felt, that he alluded, when speaking of the highest aristocracy, to an ambassador\u2019s ball he had attended, and to invitations he had received from N.N. and S.S.\n\nAll this time Nat\u00e1sha sat silent, glancing up at him from under her brows. This gaze disturbed and confused Bor\u00eds more and more. He looked round more frequently toward her, and broke off in what he was saying. He did not stay more than ten minutes, then rose and took his leave. The same inquisitive, challenging, and rather mocking eyes still looked at him. After his first visit Bor\u00eds said to himself that Nat\u00e1sha attracted him just as much as ever, but that he must not yield to that feeling, because to marry her, a girl almost without fortune, would mean ruin to his career, while to renew their former relations without intending to marry her would be dishonorable. Bor\u00eds made up his mind to avoid meeting Nat\u00e1sha, but despite that resolution he called again a few days later and began calling often and spending whole days at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019. It seemed to him that he ought to have an explanation with Nat\u00e1sha and tell her that the old times must be forgotten, that in spite of everything... she could not be his wife, that he had no means, and they would never let her marry him. But he failed to do so and felt awkward about entering on such an explanation. From day to day he became more and more entangled. It seemed to her mother and S\u00f3nya that Nat\u00e1sha was in love with Bor\u00eds as of old. She sang him his favorite songs, showed him her album, making him write in it, did not allow him to allude to the past, letting it be understood how delightful was the present; and every day he went away in a fog, without having said what he meant to, and not knowing what he was doing or why he came, or how it would all end. He left off visiting H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and received reproachful notes from her every day, and yet he continued to spend whole days with the Rost\u00f3vs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOne night when the old countess, in nightcap and dressing jacket, without her false curls, and with her poor little knob of hair showing under her white cotton cap, knelt sighing and groaning on a rug and bowing to the ground in prayer, her door creaked and Nat\u00e1sha, also in a dressing jacket with slippers on her bare feet and her hair in curlpapers, ran in. The countess\u2014her prayerful mood dispelled\u2014looked round and frowned. She was finishing her last prayer: \u201cCan it be that this couch will be my grave?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha, flushed and eager, seeing her mother in prayer, suddenly checked her rush, half sat down, and unconsciously put out her tongue as if chiding herself. Seeing that her mother was still praying she ran on tiptoe to the bed and, rapidly slipping one little foot against the other, pushed off her slippers and jumped onto the bed the countess had feared might become her grave. This couch was high, with a feather bed and five pillows each smaller than the one below. Nat\u00e1sha jumped on it, sank into the feather bed, rolled over to the wall, and began snuggling up the bedclothes as she settled down, raising her knees to her chin, kicking out and laughing almost inaudibly, now covering herself up head and all, and now peeping at her mother. The countess finished her prayers and came to the bed with a stern face, but seeing that Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s head was covered, she smiled in her kind, weak way.\n\n\u201cNow then, now then!\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cMamma, can we have a talk? Yes?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cNow, just one on your throat and another... that\u2019ll do!\u201d And seizing her mother round the neck, she kissed her on the throat. In her behavior to her mother Nat\u00e1sha seemed rough, but she was so sensitive and tactful that however she clasped her mother she always managed to do it without hurting her or making her feel uncomfortable or displeased.\n\n\u201cWell, what is it tonight?\u201d said the mother, having arranged her pillows and waited until Nat\u00e1sha, after turning over a couple of times, had settled down beside her under the quilt, spread out her arms, and assumed a serious expression.\n\nThese visits of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s at night before the count returned from his club were one of the greatest pleasures of both mother, and daughter.\n\n\u201cWhat is it tonight?\u2014But I have to tell you...\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha put her hand on her mother\u2019s mouth.\n\n\u201cAbout Bor\u00eds... I know,\u201d she said seriously; \u201cthat\u2019s what I have come about. Don\u2019t say it\u2014I know. No, do tell me!\u201d and she removed her hand. \u201cTell me, Mamma! He\u2019s nice?\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, you are sixteen. At your age I was married. You say Bor\u00eds is nice. He is very nice, and I love him like a son. But what then?... What are you thinking about? You have quite turned his head, I can see that....\u201d\n\nAs she said this the countess looked round at her daughter. Nat\u00e1sha was lying looking steadily straight before her at one of the mahogany sphinxes carved on the corners of the bedstead, so that the countess only saw her daughter\u2019s face in profile. That face struck her by its peculiarly serious and concentrated expression.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was listening and considering.\n\n\u201cWell, what then?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cYou have quite turned his head, and why? What do you want of him? You know you can\u2019t marry him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, without changing her position.\n\n\u201cBecause he is young, because he is poor, because he is a relation... and because you yourself don\u2019t love him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you know?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know. It is not right, darling!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if I want to...\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cLeave off talking nonsense,\u201d said the countess.\n\n\u201cBut if I want to...\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, I am in earnest...\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not let her finish. She drew the countess\u2019 large hand to her, kissed it on the back and then on the palm, then again turned it over and began kissing first one knuckle, then the space between the knuckles, then the next knuckle, whispering, \u201cJanuary, February, March, April, May. Speak, Mamma, why don\u2019t you say anything? Speak!\u201d said she, turning to her mother, who was tenderly gazing at her daughter and in that contemplation seemed to have forgotten all she had wished to say.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t do, my love! Not everyone will understand this friendship dating from your childish days, and to see him so intimate with you may injure you in the eyes of other young men who visit us, and above all it torments him for nothing. He may already have found a suitable and wealthy match, and now he\u2019s half crazy.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrazy?\u201d repeated Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll tell you some things about myself. I had a cousin...\u201d\n\n\u201cI know! Cyril Matv\u00e9ich... but he is old.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was not always old. But this is what I\u2019ll do, Nat\u00e1sha, I\u2019ll have a talk with Bor\u00eds. He need not come so often....\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy not, if he likes to?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause I know it will end in nothing....\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can you know? No, Mamma, don\u2019t speak to him! What nonsense!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha in the tone of one being deprived of her property. \u201cWell, I won\u2019t marry, but let him come if he enjoys it and I enjoy it.\u201d Nat\u00e1sha smiled and looked at her mother. \u201cNot to marry, but just so,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cHow so, my pet?\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so. There\u2019s no need for me to marry him. But... just so.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so, just so,\u201d repeated the countess, and shaking all over, she went off into a good humored, unexpected, elderly laugh.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t laugh, stop!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou\u2019re shaking the whole bed! You\u2019re awfully like me, just such another giggler.... Wait...\u201d and she seized the countess\u2019 hands and kissed a knuckle of the little finger, saying, \u201cJune,\u201d and continued, kissing, \u201cJuly, August,\u201d on the other hand. \u201cBut, Mamma, is he very much in love? What do you think? Was anybody ever so much in love with you? And he\u2019s very nice, very, very nice. Only not quite my taste\u2014he is so narrow, like the dining-room clock.... Don\u2019t you understand? Narrow, you know\u2014gray, light gray...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat rubbish you\u2019re talking!\u201d said the countess.\n\nNat\u00e1sha continued: \u201cDon\u2019t you really understand? Nicholas would understand.... Bez\u00fakhov, now, is blue, dark-blue and red, and he is square.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou flirt with him too,\u201d said the countess, laughing.\n\n\u201cNo, he is a Freemason, I have found out. He is fine, dark-blue and red.... How can I explain it to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cLittle countess!\u201d the count\u2019s voice called from behind the door. \u201cYou\u2019re not asleep?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha jumped up, snatched up her slippers, and ran barefoot to her own room.\n\nIt was a long time before she could sleep. She kept thinking that no one could understand all that she understood and all there was in her.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya?\u201d she thought, glancing at that curled-up, sleeping little kitten with her enormous plait of hair. \u201cNo, how could she? She\u2019s virtuous. She fell in love with Nicholas and does not wish to know anything more. Even Mamma does not understand. It is wonderful how clever I am and how... charming she is,\u201d she went on, speaking of herself in the third person, and imagining it was some very wise man\u2014the wisest and best of men\u2014who was saying it of her. \u201cThere is everything, everything in her,\u201d continued this man. \u201cShe is unusually intelligent, charming... and then she is pretty, uncommonly pretty, and agile\u2014she swims and rides splendidly... and her voice! One can really say it\u2019s a wonderful voice!\u201d\n\nShe hummed a scrap from her favorite opera by Cherubini, threw herself on her bed, laughed at the pleasant thought that she would immediately fall asleep, called Duny\u00e1sha the maid to put out the candle, and before Duny\u00e1sha had left the room had already passed into yet another happier world of dreams, where everything was as light and beautiful as in reality, and even more so because it was different.\n\nNext day the countess called Bor\u00eds aside and had a talk with him, after which he ceased coming to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nOn the thirty-first of December, New Year\u2019s Eve, 1809 - 10 an old grandee of Catherine\u2019s day was giving a ball and midnight supper. The diplomatic corps and the Emperor himself were to be present.\n\nThe grandee\u2019s well-known mansion on the English Quay glittered with innumerable lights. Police were stationed at the brightly lit entrance which was carpeted with red baize, and not only gendarmes but dozens of police officers and even the police master himself stood at the porch. Carriages kept driving away and fresh ones arriving, with red-liveried footmen and footmen in plumed hats. From the carriages emerged men wearing uniforms, stars, and ribbons, while ladies in satin and ermine cautiously descended the carriage steps which were let down for them with a clatter, and then walked hurriedly and noiselessly over the baize at the entrance.\n\nAlmost every time a new carriage drove up a whisper ran through the crowd and caps were doffed.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor?... No, a minister... prince... ambassador. Don\u2019t you see the plumes?...\u201d was whispered among the crowd.\n\nOne person, better dressed than the rest, seemed to know everyone and mentioned by name the greatest dignitaries of the day.\n\nA third of the visitors had already arrived, but the Rost\u00f3vs, who were to be present, were still hurrying to get dressed.\n\nThere had been many discussions and preparations for this ball in the Rost\u00f3v family, many fears that the invitation would not arrive, that the dresses would not be ready, or that something would not be arranged as it should be.\n\nM\u00e1rya Ign\u00e1tevna Per\u00f3nskaya, a thin and shallow maid of honor at the court of the Dowager Empress, who was a friend and relation of the countess and piloted the provincial Rost\u00f3vs in Petersburg high society, was to accompany them to the ball.\n\nThey were to call for her at her house in the Taurida Gardens at ten o\u2019clock, but it was already five minutes to ten, and the girls were not yet dressed.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was going to her first grand ball. She had got up at eight that morning and had been in a fever of excitement and activity all day. All her powers since morning had been concentrated on ensuring that they all\u2014she herself, Mamma, and S\u00f3nya\u2014should be as well dressed as possible. S\u00f3nya and her mother put themselves entirely in her hands. The countess was to wear a claret-colored velvet dress, and the two girls white gauze over pink silk slips, with roses on their bodices and their hair dressed \u00e0 la grecque.\n\nEverything essential had already been done; feet, hands, necks, and ears washed, perfumed, and powdered, as befits a ball; the openwork silk stockings and white satin shoes with ribbons were already on; the hairdressing was almost done. S\u00f3nya was finishing dressing and so was the countess, but Nat\u00e1sha, who had bustled about helping them all, was behindhand. She was still sitting before a looking-glass with a dressing jacket thrown over her slender shoulders. S\u00f3nya stood ready dressed in the middle of the room and, pressing the head of a pin till it hurt her dainty finger, was fixing on a last ribbon that squeaked as the pin went through it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the way, that\u2019s not the way, S\u00f3nya!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha turning her head and clutching with both hands at her hair which the maid who was dressing it had not time to release. \u201cThat bow is not right. Come here!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya sat down and Nat\u00e1sha pinned the ribbon on differently.\n\n\u201cAllow me, Miss! I can\u2019t do it like that,\u201d said the maid who was holding Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s hair.\n\n\u201cOh, dear! Well then, wait. That\u2019s right, S\u00f3nya.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you ready? It is nearly ten,\u201d came the countess\u2019 voice.\n\n\u201cDirectly! Directly! And you, Mamma?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have only my cap to pin on.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t do it without me!\u201d called Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou won\u2019t do it right.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s already ten.\u201d\n\nThey had decided to be at the ball by half-past ten, and Nat\u00e1sha had still to get dressed and they had to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nWhen her hair was done, Nat\u00e1sha, in her short petticoat from under which her dancing shoes showed, and in her mother\u2019s dressing jacket, ran up to S\u00f3nya, scrutinized her, and then ran to her mother. Turning her mother\u2019s head this way and that, she fastened on the cap and, hurriedly kissing her gray hair, ran back to the maids who were turning up the hem of her skirt.\n\nThe cause of the delay was Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s skirt, which was too long. Two maids were turning up the hem and hurriedly biting off the ends of thread. A third with pins in her mouth was running about between the countess and S\u00f3nya, and a fourth held the whole of the gossamer garment up high on one uplifted hand.\n\n\u201cM\u00e1vra, quicker, darling!\u201d\n\n\u201cGive me my thimble, Miss, from there...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhenever will you be ready?\u201d asked the count coming to the door. \u201cHere is some scent. Per\u00f3nskaya must be tired of waiting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ready, Miss,\u201d said the maid, holding up the shortened gauze dress with two fingers, and blowing and shaking something off it, as if by this to express a consciousness of the airiness and purity of what she held.\n\nNat\u00e1sha began putting on the dress.\n\n\u201cIn a minute! In a minute! Don\u2019t come in, Papa!\u201d she cried to her father as he opened the door\u2014speaking from under the filmy skirt which still covered her whole face.\n\nS\u00f3nya slammed the door to. A minute later they let the count in. He was wearing a blue swallow-tail coat, shoes and stockings, and was perfumed and his hair pomaded.\n\n\u201cOh, Papa! how nice you look! Charming!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, as she stood in the middle of the room smoothing out the folds of the gauze.\n\n\u201cIf you please, Miss! allow me,\u201d said the maid, who on her knees was pulling the skirt straight and shifting the pins from one side of her mouth to the other with her tongue.\n\n\u201cSay what you like,\u201d exclaimed S\u00f3nya, in a despairing voice as she looked at Nat\u00e1sha, \u201csay what you like, it\u2019s still too long.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha stepped back to look at herself in the pier glass. The dress was too long.\n\n\u201cReally, madam, it is not at all too long,\u201d said M\u00e1vra, crawling on her knees after her young lady.\n\n\u201cWell, if it\u2019s too long we\u2019ll tack it up... we\u2019ll tack it up in one minute,\u201d said the resolute Duny\u00e1sha taking a needle that was stuck on the front of her little shawl and, still kneeling on the floor, set to work once more.\n\nAt that moment, with soft steps, the countess came in shyly, in her cap and velvet gown.\n\n\u201cOo-oo, my beauty!\u201d exclaimed the count, \u201cshe looks better than any of you!\u201d\n\nHe would have embraced her but, blushing, she stepped aside fearing to be rumpled.\n\n\u201cMamma, your cap, more to this side,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI\u2019ll arrange it,\u201d and she rushed forward so that the maids who were tacking up her skirt could not move fast enough and a piece of gauze was torn off.\n\n\u201cOh goodness! What has happened? Really it was not my fault!\u201d\n\n\u201cNever mind, I\u2019ll run it up, it won\u2019t show,\u201d said Duny\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cWhat a beauty\u2014a very queen!\u201d said the nurse as she came to the door. \u201cAnd S\u00f3nya! They are lovely!\u201d\n\nAt a quarter past ten they at last got into their carriages and started. But they had still to call at the Taurida Gardens.\n\nPer\u00f3nskaya was quite ready. In spite of her age and plainness she had gone through the same process as the Rost\u00f3vs, but with less flurry\u2014for to her it was a matter of routine. Her ugly old body was washed, perfumed, and powdered in just the same way. She had washed behind her ears just as carefully, and when she entered her drawing room in her yellow dress, wearing her badge as maid of honor, her old lady\u2019s maid was as full of rapturous admiration as the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 servants had been.\n\nShe praised the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 toilets. They praised her taste and toilet, and at eleven o\u2019clock, careful of their coiffures and dresses, they settled themselves in their carriages and drove off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nNat\u00e1sha had not had a moment free since early morning and had not once had time to think of what lay before her.\n\nIn the damp chill air and crowded closeness of the swaying carriage, she for the first time vividly imagined what was in store for her there at the ball, in those brightly lighted rooms\u2014with music, flowers, dances, the Emperor, and all the brilliant young people of Petersburg. The prospect was so splendid that she hardly believed it would come true, so out of keeping was it with the chill darkness and closeness of the carriage. She understood all that awaited her only when, after stepping over the red baize at the entrance, she entered the hall, took off her fur cloak, and, beside S\u00f3nya and in front of her mother, mounted the brightly illuminated stairs between the flowers. Only then did she remember how she must behave at a ball, and tried to assume the majestic air she considered indispensable for a girl on such an occasion. But, fortunately for her, she felt her eyes growing misty, she saw nothing clearly, her pulse beat a hundred to the minute, and the blood throbbed at her heart. She could not assume that pose, which would have made her ridiculous, and she moved on almost fainting from excitement and trying with all her might to conceal it. And this was the very attitude that became her best. Before and behind them other visitors were entering, also talking in low tones and wearing ball dresses. The mirrors on the landing reflected ladies in white, pale-blue, and pink dresses, with diamonds and pearls on their bare necks and arms.\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked in the mirrors and could not distinguish her reflection from the others. All was blended into one brilliant procession. On entering the ballroom the regular hum of voices, footsteps, and greetings deafened Nat\u00e1sha, and the light and glitter dazzled her still more. The host and hostess, who had already been standing at the door for half an hour repeating the same words to the various arrivals, \u201cCharm\u00e9 de vous voir,\u201d greeted the Rost\u00f3vs and Per\u00f3nskaya in the same manner.\n\nThe two girls in their white dresses, each with a rose in her black hair, both curtsied in the same way, but the hostess\u2019 eye involuntarily rested longer on the slim Nat\u00e1sha. She looked at her and gave her alone a special smile in addition to her usual smile as hostess. Looking at her she may have recalled the golden, irrecoverable days of her own girlhood and her own first ball. The host also followed Nat\u00e1sha with his eyes and asked the count which was his daughter.\n\n\u201cCharming!\u201d said he, kissing the tips of his fingers.\n\nIn the ballroom guests stood crowding at the entrance doors awaiting the Emperor. The countess took up a position in one of the front rows of that crowd. Nat\u00e1sha heard and felt that several people were asking about her and looking at her. She realized that those noticing her liked her, and this observation helped to calm her.\n\n\u201cThere are some like ourselves and some worse,\u201d she thought.\n\nPer\u00f3nskaya was pointing out to the countess the most important people at the ball.\n\n\u201cThat is the Dutch ambassador, do you see? That gray-haired man,\u201d she said, indicating an old man with a profusion of silver-gray curly hair, who was surrounded by ladies laughing at something he said.\n\n\u201cAh, here she is, the Queen of Petersburg, Countess Bez\u00fakhova,\u201d said Per\u00f3nskaya, indicating H\u00e9l\u00e8ne who had just entered. \u201cHow lovely! She is quite equal to M\u00e1rya Ant\u00f3novna. See how the men, young and old, pay court to her. Beautiful and clever... they say Prince \u2014\u2014 is quite mad about her. But see, those two, though not good-looking, are even more run after.\u201d\n\nShe pointed to a lady who was crossing the room followed by a very plain daughter.\n\n\u201cShe is a splendid match, a millionairess,\u201d said Per\u00f3nskaya. \u201cAnd look, here come her suitors.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s brother, Anatole Kur\u00e1gin,\u201d she said, indicating a handsome officer of the Horse Guards who passed by them with head erect, looking at something over the heads of the ladies. \u201cHe\u2019s handsome, isn\u2019t he? I hear they will marry him to that rich girl. But your cousin, Drubetsk\u00f3y, is also very attentive to her. They say she has millions. Oh yes, that\u2019s the French ambassador himself!\u201d she replied to the countess\u2019 inquiry about Caulaincourt. \u201cLooks as if he were a king! All the same, the French are charming, very charming. No one more charming in society. Ah, here she is! Yes, she is still the most beautiful of them all, our M\u00e1rya Ant\u00f3novna! And how simply she is dressed! Lovely! And that stout one in spectacles is the universal Freemason,\u201d she went on, indicating Pierre. \u201cPut him beside his wife and he looks a regular buffoon!\u201d\n\nPierre, swaying his stout body, advanced, making way through the crowd and nodding to right and left as casually and good-naturedly as if he were passing through a crowd at a fair. He pushed through, evidently looking for someone.\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked joyfully at the familiar face of Pierre, \u201cthe buffoon,\u201d as Per\u00f3nskaya had called him, and knew he was looking for them, and for her in particular. He had promised to be at the ball and introduce partners to her.\n\nBut before he reached them Pierre stopped beside a very handsome, dark man of middle height, and in a white uniform, who stood by a window talking to a tall man wearing stars and a ribbon. Nat\u00e1sha at once recognized the shorter and younger man in the white uniform: it was Bolk\u00f3nski, who seemed to her to have grown much younger, happier, and better-looking.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone else we know\u2014Bolk\u00f3nski, do you see, Mamma?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, pointing out Prince Andrew. \u201cYou remember, he stayed a night with us at Otr\u00e1dnoe.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, you know him?\u201d said Per\u00f3nskaya. \u201cI can\u2019t bear him. Il fait \u00e0 pr\u00e9sent la pluie et le beau temps. He\u2019s too proud for anything. Takes after his father. And he\u2019s hand in glove with Sper\u00e1nski, writing some project or other. Just look how he treats the ladies! There\u2019s one talking to him and he has turned away,\u201d she said, pointing at him. \u201cI\u2019d give it to him if he treated me as he does those ladies.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nSuddenly everybody stirred, began talking, and pressed forward and then back, and between the two rows, which separated, the Emperor entered to the sounds of music that had immediately struck up. Behind him walked his host and hostess. He walked in rapidly, bowing to right and left as if anxious to get the first moments of the reception over. The band played the polonaise in vogue at that time on account of the words that had been set to it, beginning: \u201cAlexander, Elisaveta, all our hearts you ravish quite...\u201d The Emperor passed on to the drawing room, the crowd made a rush for the doors, and several persons with excited faces hurried there and back again. Then the crowd hastily retired from the drawing room door, at which the Emperor reappeared talking to the hostess. A young man, looking distraught, pounced down on the ladies, asking them to move aside. Some ladies, with faces betraying complete forgetfulness of all the rules of decorum, pushed forward to the detriment of their toilets. The men began to choose partners and take their places for the polonaise.\n\nEveryone moved back, and the Emperor came smiling out of the drawing room leading his hostess by the hand but not keeping time to the music. The host followed with M\u00e1rya Ant\u00f3novna Nar\u00fdshkina; then came ambassadors, ministers, and various generals, whom Per\u00f3nskaya diligently named. More than half the ladies already had partners and were taking up, or preparing to take up, their positions for the polonaise. Nat\u00e1sha felt that she would be left with her mother and S\u00f3nya among a minority of women who crowded near the wall, not having been invited to dance. She stood with her slender arms hanging down, her scarcely defined bosom rising and falling regularly, and with bated breath and glittering, frightened eyes gazed straight before her, evidently prepared for the height of joy or misery. She was not concerned about the Emperor or any of those great people whom Per\u00f3nskaya was pointing out\u2014she had but one thought: \u201cIs it possible no one will ask me, that I shall not be among the first to dance? Is it possible that not one of all these men will notice me? They do not even seem to see me, or if they do they look as if they were saying, \u2018Ah, she\u2019s not the one I\u2019m after, so it\u2019s not worth looking at her!\u2019 No, it\u2019s impossible,\u201d she thought. \u201cThey must know how I long to dance, how splendidly I dance, and how they would enjoy dancing with me.\u201d\n\nThe strains of the polonaise, which had continued for a considerable time, had begun to sound like a sad reminiscence to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s ears. She wanted to cry. Per\u00f3nskaya had left them. The count was at the other end of the room. She and the countess and S\u00f3nya were standing by themselves as in the depths of a forest amid that crowd of strangers, with no one interested in them and not wanted by anyone. Prince Andrew with a lady passed by, evidently not recognizing them. The handsome Anatole was smilingly talking to a partner on his arm and looked at Nat\u00e1sha as one looks at a wall. Bor\u00eds passed them twice and each time turned away. Berg and his wife, who were not dancing, came up to them.\n\nThis family gathering seemed humiliating to Nat\u00e1sha\u2014as if there were nowhere else for the family to talk but here at the ball. She did not listen to or look at V\u00e9ra, who was telling her something about her own green dress.\n\nAt last the Emperor stopped beside his last partner (he had danced with three) and the music ceased. A worried aide-de-camp ran up to the Rost\u00f3vs requesting them to stand farther back, though as it was they were already close to the wall, and from the gallery resounded the distinct, precise, enticingly rhythmical strains of a waltz. The Emperor looked smilingly down the room. A minute passed but no one had yet begun dancing. An aide-de-camp, the Master of Ceremonies, went up to Countess Bez\u00fakhova and asked her to dance. She smilingly raised her hand and laid it on his shoulder without looking at him. The aide-de-camp, an adept in his art, grasping his partner firmly round her waist, with confident deliberation started smoothly, gliding first round the edge of the circle, then at the corner of the room he caught H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s left hand and turned her, the only sound audible, apart from the ever-quickening music, being the rhythmic click of the spurs on his rapid, agile feet, while at every third beat his partner\u2019s velvet dress spread out and seemed to flash as she whirled round. Nat\u00e1sha gazed at them and was ready to cry because it was not she who was dancing that first turn of the waltz.\n\nPrince Andrew, in the white uniform of a cavalry colonel, wearing stockings and dancing shoes, stood looking animated and bright in the front row of the circle not far from the Rost\u00f3vs. Baron Firhoff was talking to him about the first sitting of the Council of State to be held next day. Prince Andrew, as one closely connected with Sper\u00e1nski and participating in the work of the legislative commission, could give reliable information about that sitting, concerning which various rumors were current. But not listening to what Firhoff was saying, he was gazing now at the sovereign and now at the men intending to dance who had not yet gathered courage to enter the circle.\n\nPrince Andrew was watching these men abashed by the Emperor\u2019s presence, and the women who were breathlessly longing to be asked to dance.\n\nPierre came up to him and caught him by the arm.\n\n\u201cYou always dance. I have a prot\u00e9g\u00e9e, the young Rost\u00f3va, here. Ask her,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhere is she?\u201d asked Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cExcuse me!\u201d he added, turning to the baron, \u201cwe will finish this conversation elsewhere\u2014at a ball one must dance.\u201d He stepped forward in the direction Pierre indicated. The despairing, dejected expression of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face caught his eye. He recognized her, guessed her feelings, saw that it was her d\u00e9but, remembered her conversation at the window, and with an expression of pleasure on his face approached Countess Rost\u00f3va.\n\n\u201cAllow me to introduce you to my daughter,\u201d said the countess, with heightened color.\n\n\u201cI have the pleasure of being already acquainted, if the countess remembers me,\u201d said Prince Andrew with a low and courteous bow quite belying Per\u00f3nskaya\u2019s remarks about his rudeness, and approaching Nat\u00e1sha he held out his arm to grasp her waist before he had completed his invitation. He asked her to waltz. That tremulous expression on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, prepared either for despair or rapture, suddenly brightened into a happy, grateful, childlike smile.\n\n\u201cI have long been waiting for you,\u201d that frightened happy little girl seemed to say by the smile that replaced the threatened tears, as she raised her hand to Prince Andrew\u2019s shoulder. They were the second couple to enter the circle. Prince Andrew was one of the best dancers of his day and Nat\u00e1sha danced exquisitely. Her little feet in their white satin dancing shoes did their work swiftly, lightly, and independently of herself, while her face beamed with ecstatic happiness. Her slender bare arms and neck were not beautiful\u2014compared to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s her shoulders looked thin and her bosom undeveloped. But H\u00e9l\u00e8ne seemed, as it were, hardened by a varnish left by the thousands of looks that had scanned her person, while Nat\u00e1sha was like a girl exposed for the first time, who would have felt very much ashamed had she not been assured that this was absolutely necessary.\n\nPrince Andrew liked dancing, and wishing to escape as quickly as possible from the political and clever talk which everyone addressed to him, wishing also to break up the circle of restraint he disliked, caused by the Emperor\u2019s presence, he danced, and had chosen Nat\u00e1sha because Pierre pointed her out to him and because she was the first pretty girl who caught his eye; but scarcely had he embraced that slender supple figure and felt her stirring so close to him and smiling so near him than the wine of her charm rose to his head, and he felt himself revived and rejuvenated when after leaving her he stood breathing deeply and watching the other dancers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter Prince Andrew, Bor\u00eds came up to ask Nat\u00e1sha for a dance, and then the aide-de-camp who had opened the ball, and several other young men, so that, flushed and happy, and passing on her superfluous partners to S\u00f3nya, she did not cease dancing all the evening. She noticed and saw nothing of what occupied everyone else. Not only did she fail to notice that the Emperor talked a long time with the French ambassador, and how particularly gracious he was to a certain lady, or that Prince So-and-so and So-and-so did and said this and that, and that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had great success and was honored by the special attention of So-and-so, but she did not even see the Emperor, and only noticed that he had gone because the ball became livelier after his departure. For one of the merry cotillions before supper Prince Andrew was again her partner. He reminded her of their first encounter in the Otr\u00e1dnoe avenue, and how she had been unable to sleep that moonlight night, and told her how he had involuntarily overheard her. Nat\u00e1sha blushed at that recollection and tried to excuse herself, as if there had been something to be ashamed of in what Prince Andrew had overheard.\n\nLike all men who have grown up in society, Prince Andrew liked meeting someone there not of the conventional society stamp. And such was Nat\u00e1sha, with her surprise, her delight, her shyness, and even her mistakes in speaking French. With her he behaved with special care and tenderness, sitting beside her and talking of the simplest and most unimportant matters; he admired her shy grace. In the middle of the cotillion, having completed one of the figures, Nat\u00e1sha, still out of breath, was returning to her seat when another dancer chose her. She was tired and panting and evidently thought of declining, but immediately put her hand gaily on the man\u2019s shoulder, smiling at Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d be glad to sit beside you and rest: I\u2019m tired; but you see how they keep asking me, and I\u2019m glad of it, I\u2019m happy and I love everybody, and you and I understand it all,\u201d and much, much more was said in her smile. When her partner left her Nat\u00e1sha ran across the room to choose two ladies for the figure.\n\n\u201cIf she goes to her cousin first and then to another lady, she will be my wife,\u201d said Prince Andrew to himself quite to his own surprise, as he watched her. She did go first to her cousin.\n\n\u201cWhat rubbish sometimes enters one\u2019s head!\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut what is certain is that that girl is so charming, so original, that she won\u2019t be dancing here a month before she will be married.... Such as she are rare here,\u201d he thought, as Nat\u00e1sha, readjusting a rose that was slipping on her bodice, settled herself beside him.\n\nWhen the cotillion was over the old count in his blue coat came up to the dancers. He invited Prince Andrew to come and see them, and asked his daughter whether she was enjoying herself. Nat\u00e1sha did not answer at once but only looked up with a smile that said reproachfully: \u201cHow can you ask such a question?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have never enjoyed myself so much before!\u201d she said, and Prince Andrew noticed how her thin arms rose quickly as if to embrace her father and instantly dropped again. Nat\u00e1sha was happier than she had ever been in her life. She was at that height of bliss when one becomes completely kind and good and does not believe in the possibility of evil, unhappiness, or sorrow.\n\nAt that ball Pierre for the first time felt humiliated by the position his wife occupied in court circles. He was gloomy and absent-minded. A deep furrow ran across his forehead, and standing by a window he stared over his spectacles seeing no one.\n\nOn her way to supper Nat\u00e1sha passed him.\n\nPierre\u2019s gloomy, unhappy look struck her. She stopped in front of him. She wished to help him, to bestow on him the superabundance of her own happiness.\n\n\u201cHow delightful it is, Count!\u201d said she. \u201cIsn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nPierre smiled absent-mindedly, evidently not grasping what she said.\n\n\u201cYes, I am very glad,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow can people be dissatisfied with anything?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cEspecially such a capital fellow as Bez\u00fakhov!\u201d In Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s eyes all the people at the ball alike were good, kind, and splendid people, loving one another; none of them capable of injuring another\u2014and so they ought all to be happy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nNext day Prince Andrew thought of the ball, but his mind did not dwell on it long. \u201cYes, it was a very brilliant ball,\u201d and then... \u201cYes, that little Rost\u00f3va is very charming. There\u2019s something fresh, original, un-Petersburg-like about her that distinguishes her.\u201d That was all he thought about yesterday\u2019s ball, and after his morning tea he set to work.\n\nBut either from fatigue or want of sleep he was ill-disposed for work and could get nothing done. He kept criticizing his own work, as he often did, and was glad when he heard someone coming.\n\nThe visitor was B\u00edtski, who served on various committees, frequented all the societies in Petersburg, and was a passionate devotee of the new ideas and of Sper\u00e1nski, and a diligent Petersburg newsmonger\u2014one of those men who choose their opinions like their clothes according to the fashion, but who for that very reason appear to be the warmest partisans. Hardly had he got rid of his hat before he ran into Prince Andrew\u2019s room with a preoccupied air and at once began talking. He had just heard particulars of that morning\u2019s sitting of the Council of State opened by the Emperor, and he spoke of it enthusiastically. The Emperor\u2019s speech had been extraordinary. It had been a speech such as only constitutional monarchs deliver. \u201cThe Sovereign plainly said that the Council and Senate are estates of the realm, he said that the government must rest not on authority but on secure bases. The Emperor said that the fiscal system must be reorganized and the accounts published,\u201d recounted B\u00edtski, emphasizing certain words and opening his eyes significantly.\n\n\u201cAh, yes! Today\u2019s events mark an epoch, the greatest epoch in our history,\u201d he concluded.\n\nPrince Andrew listened to the account of the opening of the Council of State, which he had so impatiently awaited and to which he had attached such importance, and was surprised that this event, now that it had taken place, did not affect him, and even seemed quite insignificant. He listened with quiet irony to B\u00edtski\u2019s enthusiastic account of it. A very simple thought occurred to him: \u201cWhat does it matter to me or to B\u00edtski what the Emperor was pleased to say at the Council? Can all that make me any happier or better?\u201d\n\nAnd this simple reflection suddenly destroyed all the interest Prince Andrew had felt in the impending reforms. He was going to dine that evening at Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s, \u201cwith only a few friends,\u201d as the host had said when inviting him. The prospect of that dinner in the intimate home circle of the man he so admired had greatly interested Prince Andrew, especially as he had not yet seen Sper\u00e1nski in his domestic surroundings, but now he felt disinclined to go to it.\n\nAt the appointed hour, however, he entered the modest house Sper\u00e1nski owned in the Taurida Gardens. In the parqueted dining room of this small house, remarkable for its extreme cleanliness (suggesting that of a monastery), Prince Andrew, who was rather late, found the friendly gathering of Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s intimate acquaintances already assembled at five o\u2019clock. There were no ladies present except Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s little daughter (long-faced like her father) and her governess. The other guests were Gervais, Magn\u00edtski, and Stol\u00fdpin. While still in the anteroom Prince Andrew heard loud voices and a ringing staccato laugh\u2014a laugh such as one hears on the stage. Someone\u2014it sounded like Sper\u00e1nski\u2014was distinctly ejaculating ha-ha-ha. Prince Andrew had never before heard Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s famous laugh, and this ringing, high-pitched laughter from a statesman made a strange impression on him.\n\nHe entered the dining room. The whole company were standing between two windows at a small table laid with hors-d\u2019oeuvres. Sper\u00e1nski, wearing a gray swallow-tail coat with a star on the breast, and evidently still the same waistcoat and high white stock he had worn at the meeting of the Council of State, stood at the table with a beaming countenance. His guests surrounded him. Magn\u00edtski, addressing himself to Sper\u00e1nski, was relating an anecdote, and Sper\u00e1nski was laughing in advance at what Magn\u00edtski was going to say. When Prince Andrew entered the room Magn\u00edtski\u2019s words were again crowned by laughter. Stol\u00fdpin gave a deep bass guffaw as he munched a piece of bread and cheese. Gervais laughed softly with a hissing chuckle, and Sper\u00e1nski in a high-pitched staccato manner.\n\nStill laughing, Sper\u00e1nski held out his soft white hand to Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cVery pleased to see you, Prince,\u201d he said. \u201cOne moment...\u201d he went on, turning to Magn\u00edtski and interrupting his story. \u201cWe have agreed that this is a dinner for recreation, with not a word about business!\u201d and turning again to the narrator he began to laugh afresh.\n\nPrince Andrew looked at the laughing Sper\u00e1nski with astonishment, regret, and disillusionment. It seemed to him that this was not Sper\u00e1nski but someone else. Everything that had formerly appeared mysterious and fascinating in Sper\u00e1nski suddenly became plain and unattractive.\n\nAt dinner the conversation did not cease for a moment and seemed to consist of the contents of a book of funny anecdotes. Before Magn\u00edtski had finished his story someone else was anxious to relate something still funnier. Most of the anecdotes, if not relating to the state service, related to people in the service. It seemed that in this company the insignificance of those people was so definitely accepted that the only possible attitude toward them was one of good humored ridicule. Sper\u00e1nski related how at the Council that morning a deaf dignitary, when asked his opinion, replied that he thought so too. Gervais gave a long account of an official revision, remarkable for the stupidity of everybody concerned. Stol\u00fdpin, stuttering, broke into the conversation and began excitedly talking of the abuses that existed under the former order of things\u2014threatening to give a serious turn to the conversation. Magn\u00edtski starting quizzing Stol\u00fdpin about his vehemence. Gervais intervened with a joke, and the talk reverted to its former lively tone.\n\nEvidently Sper\u00e1nski liked to rest after his labors and find amusement in a circle of friends, and his guests, understanding his wish, tried to enliven him ", "sequence": 11}, {"offset": 1200000, "text": "and amuse themselves. But their gaiety seemed to Prince Andrew mirthless and tiresome. Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s high-pitched voice struck him unpleasantly, and the incessant laughter grated on him like a false note. Prince Andrew did not laugh and feared that he would be a damper on the spirits of the company, but no one took any notice of his being out of harmony with the general mood. They all seemed very gay.\n\nHe tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could not jest with them.\n\nThere was nothing wrong or unseemly in what they said, it was witty and might have been funny, but it lacked just that something which is the salt of mirth, and they were not even aware that such a thing existed.\n\nAfter dinner Sper\u00e1nski\u2019s daughter and her governess rose. He patted the little girl with his white hand and kissed her. And that gesture, too, seemed unnatural to Prince Andrew.\n\nThe men remained at table over their port\u2014English fashion. In the midst of a conversation that was started about Napoleon\u2019s Spanish affairs, which they all agreed in approving, Prince Andrew began to express a contrary opinion. Sper\u00e1nski smiled and, with an evident wish to prevent the conversation from taking an unpleasant course, told a story that had no connection with the previous conversation. For a few moments all were silent.\n\nHaving sat some time at table, Sper\u00e1nski corked a bottle of wine and, remarking, \u201cNowadays good wine rides in a carriage and pair,\u201d passed it to the servant and got up. All rose and continuing to talk loudly went into the drawing room. Two letters brought by a courier were handed to Sper\u00e1nski and he took them to his study. As soon as he had left the room the general merriment stopped and the guests began to converse sensibly and quietly with one another.\n\n\u201cNow for the recitation!\u201d said Sper\u00e1nski on returning from his study. \u201cA wonderful talent!\u201d he said to Prince Andrew, and Magn\u00edtski immediately assumed a pose and began reciting some humorous verses in French which he had composed about various well-known Petersburg people. He was interrupted several times by applause. When the verses were finished Prince Andrew went up to Sper\u00e1nski and took his leave.\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to so early?\u201d asked Sper\u00e1nski.\n\n\u201cI promised to go to a reception.\u201d\n\nThey said no more. Prince Andrew looked closely into those mirrorlike, impenetrable eyes, and felt that it had been ridiculous of him to have expected anything from Sper\u00e1nski and from any of his own activities connected with him, or ever to have attributed importance to what Sper\u00e1nski was doing. That precise, mirthless laughter rang in Prince Andrew\u2019s ears long after he had left the house.\n\nWhen he reached home Prince Andrew began thinking of his life in Petersburg during those last four months as if it were something new. He recalled his exertions and solicitations, and the history of his project of army reform, which had been accepted for consideration and which they were trying to pass over in silence simply because another, a very poor one, had already been prepared and submitted to the Emperor. He thought of the meetings of a committee of which Berg was a member. He remembered how carefully and at what length everything relating to form and procedure was discussed at those meetings, and how sedulously and promptly all that related to the gist of the business was evaded. He recalled his labors on the Legal Code, and how painstakingly he had translated the articles of the Roman and French codes into Russian, and he felt ashamed of himself. Then he vividly pictured to himself Boguch\u00e1rovo, his occupations in the country, his journey to Ryaz\u00e1n; he remembered the peasants and Dron the village elder, and mentally applying to them the Personal Rights he had divided into paragraphs, he felt astonished that he could have spent so much time on such useless work.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nNext day Prince Andrew called at a few houses he had not visited before, and among them at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 with whom he had renewed acquaintance at the ball. Apart from considerations of politeness which demanded the call, he wanted to see that original, eager girl who had left such a pleasant impression on his mind, in her own home.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was one of the first to meet him. She was wearing a dark-blue house dress in which Prince Andrew thought her even prettier than in her ball dress. She and all the Rost\u00f3v family welcomed him as an old friend, simply and cordially. The whole family, whom he had formerly judged severely, now seemed to him to consist of excellent, simple, and kindly people. The old count\u2019s hospitality and good nature, which struck one especially in Petersburg as a pleasant surprise, were such that Prince Andrew could not refuse to stay to dinner. \u201cYes,\u201d he thought, \u201cthey are capital people, who of course have not the slightest idea what a treasure they possess in Nat\u00e1sha; but they are kindly folk and form the best possible setting for this strikingly poetic, charming girl, overflowing with life!\u201d\n\nIn Nat\u00e1sha Prince Andrew was conscious of a strange world completely alien to him and brimful of joys unknown to him, a different world, that in the Otr\u00e1dnoe avenue and at the window that moonlight night had already begun to disconcert him. Now this world disconcerted him no longer and was no longer alien to him, but he himself having entered it found in it a new enjoyment.\n\nAfter dinner Nat\u00e1sha, at Prince Andrew\u2019s request, went to the clavichord and began singing. Prince Andrew stood by a window talking to the ladies and listened to her. In the midst of a phrase he ceased speaking and suddenly felt tears choking him, a thing he had thought impossible for him. He looked at Nat\u00e1sha as she sang, and something new and joyful stirred in his soul. He felt happy and at the same time sad. He had absolutely nothing to weep about yet he was ready to weep. What about? His former love? The little princess? His disillusionments?... His hopes for the future?... Yes and no. The chief reason was a sudden, vivid sense of the terrible contrast between something infinitely great and illimitable within him and that limited and material something that he, and even she, was. This contrast weighed on and yet cheered him while she sang.\n\nAs soon as Nat\u00e1sha had finished she went up to him and asked how he liked her voice. She asked this and then became confused, feeling that she ought not to have asked it. He smiled, looking at her, and said he liked her singing as he liked everything she did.\n\nPrince Andrew left the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 late in the evening. He went to bed from habit, but soon realized that he could not sleep. Having lit his candle he sat up in bed, then got up, then lay down again not at all troubled by his sleeplessness: his soul was as fresh and joyful as if he had stepped out of a stuffy room into God\u2019s own fresh air. It did not enter his head that he was in love with Nat\u00e1sha; he was not thinking about her, but only picturing her to himself, and in consequence all life appeared in a new light. \u201cWhy do I strive, why do I toil in this narrow, confined frame, when life, all life with all its joys, is open to me?\u201d said he to himself. And for the first time for a very long while he began making happy plans for the future. He decided that he must attend to his son\u2019s education by finding a tutor and putting the boy in his charge, then he ought to retire from the service and go abroad, and see England, Switzerland and Italy. \u201cI must use my freedom while I feel so much strength and youth in me,\u201d he said to himself. \u201cPierre was right when he said one must believe in the possibility of happiness in order to be happy, and now I do believe in it. Let the dead bury their dead, but while one has life one must live and be happy!\u201d thought he.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOne morning Colonel Berg, whom Pierre knew as he knew everybody in Moscow and Petersburg, came to see him. Berg arrived in an immaculate brand-new uniform, with his hair pomaded and brushed forward over his temples as the Emperor Alexander wore his hair.\n\n\u201cI have just been to see the countess, your wife. Unfortunately she could not grant my request, but I hope, Count, I shall be more fortunate with you,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you wish, Colonel? I am at your service.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have now quite settled in my new rooms, Count\u201d (Berg said this with perfect conviction that this information could not but be agreeable), \u201cand so I wish to arrange just a small party for my own and my wife\u2019s friends.\u201d (He smiled still more pleasantly.) \u201cI wished to ask the countess and you to do me the honor of coming to tea and to supper.\u201d\n\nOnly Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, considering the society of such people as the Bergs beneath her, could be cruel enough to refuse such an invitation. Berg explained so clearly why he wanted to collect at his house a small but select company, and why this would give him pleasure, and why though he grudged spending money on cards or anything harmful, he was prepared to run into some expense for the sake of good society\u2014that Pierre could not refuse, and promised to come.\n\n\u201cBut don\u2019t be late, Count, if I may venture to ask; about ten minutes to eight, please. We shall make up a rubber. Our general is coming. He is very good to me. We shall have supper, Count. So you will do me the favor.\u201d\n\nContrary to his habit of being late, Pierre on that day arrived at the Bergs\u2019 house, not at ten but at fifteen minutes to eight.\n\nHaving prepared everything necessary for the party, the Bergs were ready for their guests\u2019 arrival.\n\nIn their new, clean, and light study with its small busts and pictures and new furniture sat Berg and his wife. Berg, closely buttoned up in his new uniform, sat beside his wife explaining to her that one always could and should be acquainted with people above one, because only then does one get satisfaction from acquaintances.\n\n\u201cYou can get to know something, you can ask for something. See how I managed from my first promotion.\u201d (Berg measured his life not by years but by promotions.) \u201cMy comrades are still nobodies, while I am only waiting for a vacancy to command a regiment, and have the happiness to be your husband.\u201d (He rose and kissed V\u00e9ra\u2019s hand, and on the way to her straightened out a turned-up corner of the carpet.) \u201cAnd how have I obtained all this? Chiefly by knowing how to choose my aquaintances. It goes without saying that one must be conscientious and methodical.\u201d\n\nBerg smiled with a sense of his superiority over a weak woman, and paused, reflecting that this dear wife of his was after all but a weak woman who could not understand all that constitutes a man\u2019s dignity, what it was ein Mann zu sein. V\u00e9ra at the same time smiling with a sense of superiority over her good, conscientious husband, who all the same understood life wrongly, as according to V\u00e9ra all men did. Berg, judging by his wife, thought all women weak and foolish. V\u00e9ra, judging only by her husband and generalizing from that observation, supposed that all men, though they understand nothing and are conceited and selfish, ascribe common sense to themselves alone.\n\nBerg rose and embraced his wife carefully, so as not to crush her lace fichu for which he had paid a good price, kissing her straight on the lips.\n\n\u201cThe only thing is, we mustn\u2019t have children too soon,\u201d he continued, following an unconscious sequence of ideas.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered V\u00e9ra, \u201cI don\u2019t at all want that. We must live for society.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrincess Yus\u00fapova wore one exactly like this,\u201d said Berg, pointing to the fichu with a happy and kindly smile.\n\nJust then Count Bez\u00fakhov was announced. Husband and wife glanced at one another, both smiling with self-satisfaction, and each mentally claiming the honor of this visit.\n\n\u201cThis is what comes of knowing how to make acquaintances,\u201d thought Berg. \u201cThis is what comes of knowing how to conduct oneself.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut please don\u2019t interrupt me when I am entertaining the guests,\u201d said V\u00e9ra, \u201cbecause I know what interests each of them and what to say to different people.\u201d\n\nBerg smiled again.\n\n\u201cIt can\u2019t be helped: men must sometimes have masculine conversation,\u201d said he.\n\nThey received Pierre in their small, new drawing room, where it was impossible to sit down anywhere without disturbing its symmetry, neatness, and order; so it was quite comprehensible and not strange that Berg, having generously offered to disturb the symmetry of an armchair or of the sofa for his dear guest, but being apparently painfully undecided on the matter himself, eventually left the visitor to settle the question of selection. Pierre disturbed the symmetry by moving a chair for himself, and Berg and V\u00e9ra immediately began their evening party, interrupting each other in their efforts to entertain their guest.\n\nV\u00e9ra, having decided in her own mind that Pierre ought to be entertained with conversation about the French embassy, at once began accordingly. Berg, having decided that masculine conversation was required, interrupted his wife\u2019s remarks and touched on the question of the war with Austria, and unconsciously jumped from the general subject to personal considerations as to the proposals made him to take part in the Austrian campaign and the reasons why he had declined them. Though the conversation was very incoherent and V\u00e9ra was angry at the intrusion of the masculine element, both husband and wife felt with satisfaction that, even if only one guest was present, their evening had begun very well and was as like as two peas to every other evening party with its talk, tea, and lighted candles.\n\nBefore long Bor\u00eds, Berg\u2019s old comrade, arrived. There was a shade of condescension and patronage in his treatment of Berg and V\u00e9ra. After Bor\u00eds came a lady with the colonel, then the general himself, then the Rost\u00f3vs, and the party became unquestionably exactly like all other evening parties. Berg and V\u00e9ra could not repress their smiles of satisfaction at the sight of all this movement in their drawing room, at the sound of the disconnected talk, the rustling of dresses, and the bowing and scraping. Everything was just as everybody always has it, especially so the general, who admired the apartment, patted Berg on the shoulder, and with parental authority superintended the setting out of the table for boston. The general sat down by Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, who was next to himself the most important guest. The old people sat with the old, the young with the young, and the hostess at the tea table, on which stood exactly the same kind of cakes in a silver cake basket as the Panins had at their party. Everything was just as it was everywhere else.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre, as one of the principal guests, had to sit down to boston with Count Rost\u00f3v, the general, and the colonel. At the card table he happened to be directly facing Nat\u00e1sha, and was struck by a curious change that had come over her since the ball. She was silent, and not only less pretty than at the ball, but only redeemed from plainness by her look of gentle indifference to everything around.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with her?\u201d thought Pierre, glancing at her. She was sitting by her sister at the tea table, and reluctantly, without looking at him, made some reply to Bor\u00eds who sat down beside her. After playing out a whole suit and to his partner\u2019s delight taking five tricks, Pierre, hearing greetings and the steps of someone who had entered the room while he was picking up his tricks, glanced again at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened to her?\u201d he asked himself with still greater surprise.\n\nPrince Andrew was standing before her, saying something to her with a look of tender solicitude. She, having raised her head, was looking up at him, flushed and evidently trying to master her rapid breathing. And the bright glow of some inner fire that had been suppressed was again alight in her. She was completely transformed and from a plain girl had again become what she had been at the ball.\n\nPrince Andrew went up to Pierre, and the latter noticed a new and youthful expression in his friend\u2019s face.\n\nPierre changed places several times during the game, sitting now with his back to Nat\u00e1sha and now facing her, but during the whole of the six rubbers he watched her and his friend.\n\n\u201cSomething very important is happening between them,\u201d thought Pierre, and a feeling that was both joyful and painful agitated him and made him neglect the game.\n\nAfter six rubbers the general got up, saying that it was no use playing like that, and Pierre was released. Nat\u00e1sha on one side was talking with S\u00f3nya and Bor\u00eds, and V\u00e9ra with a subtle smile was saying something to Prince Andrew. Pierre went up to his friend and, asking whether they were talking secrets, sat down beside them. V\u00e9ra, having noticed Prince Andrew\u2019s attentions to Nat\u00e1sha, decided that at a party, a real evening party, subtle allusions to the tender passion were absolutely necessary and, seizing a moment when Prince Andrew was alone, began a conversation with him about feelings in general and about her sister. With so intellectual a guest as she considered Prince Andrew to be, she felt that she had to employ her diplomatic tact.\n\nWhen Pierre went up to them he noticed that V\u00e9ra was being carried away by her self-satisfied talk, but that Prince Andrew seemed embarrassed, a thing that rarely happened with him.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think?\u201d V\u00e9ra was saying with an arch smile. \u201cYou are so discerning, Prince, and understand people\u2019s characters so well at a glance. What do you think of Natalie? Could she be constant in her attachments? Could she, like other women\u201d (V\u00e9ra meant herself), \u201clove a man once for all and remain true to him forever? That is what I consider true love. What do you think, Prince?\u201d\n\n\u201cI know your sister too little,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, with a sarcastic smile under which he wished to hide his embarrassment, \u201cto be able to solve so delicate a question, and then I have noticed that the less attractive a woman is the more constant she is likely to be,\u201d he added, and looked up at Pierre who was just approaching them.\n\n\u201cYes, that is true, Prince. In our days,\u201d continued V\u00e9ra\u2014mentioning \u201cour days\u201d as people of limited intelligence are fond of doing, imagining that they have discovered and appraised the peculiarities of \u201cour days\u201d and that human characteristics change with the times\u2014\u201cin our days a girl has so much freedom that the pleasure of being courted often stifles real feeling in her. And it must be confessed that Natalie is very susceptible.\u201d This return to the subject of Natalie caused Prince Andrew to knit his brows with discomfort: he was about to rise, but V\u00e9ra continued with a still more subtle smile:\n\n\u201cI think no one has been more courted than she,\u201d she went on, \u201cbut till quite lately she never cared seriously for anyone. Now you know, Count,\u201d she said to Pierre, \u201ceven our dear cousin Bor\u00eds, who, between ourselves, was very far gone in the land of tenderness...\u201d (alluding to a map of love much in vogue at that time).\n\nPrince Andrew frowned and remained silent.\n\n\u201cYou are friendly with Bor\u00eds, aren\u2019t you?\u201d asked V\u00e9ra.\n\n\u201cYes, I know him....\u201d\n\n\u201cI expect he has told you of his childish love for Nat\u00e1sha?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, there was childish love?\u201d suddenly asked Prince Andrew, blushing unexpectedly.\n\n\u201cYes, you know between cousins intimacy often leads to love. Le cousinage est un dangereux voisinage. Don\u2019t you think so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, undoubtedly!\u201d said Prince Andrew, and with sudden and unnatural liveliness he began chaffing Pierre about the need to be very careful with his fifty-year-old Moscow cousins, and in the midst of these jesting remarks he rose, taking Pierre by the arm, and drew him aside.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d asked Pierre, seeing his friend\u2019s strange animation with surprise, and noticing the glance he turned on Nat\u00e1sha as he rose.\n\n\u201cI must... I must have a talk with you,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cYou know that pair of women\u2019s gloves?\u201d (He referred to the Masonic gloves given to a newly initiated Brother to present to the woman he loved.) \u201cI... but no, I will talk to you later on,\u201d and with a strange light in his eyes and restlessness in his movements, Prince Andrew approached Nat\u00e1sha and sat down beside her. Pierre saw how Prince Andrew asked her something and how she flushed as she replied.\n\nBut at that moment Berg came to Pierre and began insisting that he should take part in an argument between the general and the colonel on the affairs in Spain.\n\nBerg was satisfied and happy. The smile of pleasure never left his face. The party was very successful and quite like other parties he had seen. Everything was similar: the ladies\u2019 subtle talk, the cards, the general raising his voice at the card table, and the samovar and the tea cakes; only one thing was lacking that he had always seen at the evening parties he wished to imitate. They had not yet had a loud conversation among the men and a dispute about something important and clever. Now the general had begun such a discussion and so Berg drew Pierre to it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nNext day, having been invited by the count, Prince Andrew dined with the Rost\u00f3vs and spent the rest of the day there.\n\nEveryone in the house realized for whose sake Prince Andrew came, and without concealing it he tried to be with Nat\u00e1sha all day. Not only in the soul of the frightened yet happy and enraptured Nat\u00e1sha, but in the whole house, there was a feeling of awe at something important that was bound to happen. The countess looked with sad and sternly serious eyes at Prince Andrew when he talked to Nat\u00e1sha and timidly started some artificial conversation about trifles as soon as he looked her way. S\u00f3nya was afraid to leave Nat\u00e1sha and afraid of being in the way when she was with them. Nat\u00e1sha grew pale, in a panic of expectation, when she remained alone with him for a moment. Prince Andrew surprised her by his timidity. She felt that he wanted to say something to her but could not bring himself to do so.\n\nIn the evening, when Prince Andrew had left, the countess went up to Nat\u00e1sha and whispered: \u201cWell, what?\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma! For heaven\u2019s sake don\u2019t ask me anything now! One can\u2019t talk about that,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nBut all the same that night Nat\u00e1sha, now agitated and now frightened, lay a long time in her mother\u2019s bed gazing straight before her. She told her how he had complimented her, how he told her he was going abroad, asked her where they were going to spend the summer, and then how he had asked her about Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cBut such a... such a... never happened to me before!\u201d she said. \u201cOnly I feel afraid in his presence. I am always afraid when I\u2019m with him. What does that mean? Does it mean that it\u2019s the real thing? Yes? Mamma, are you asleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my love; I am frightened myself,\u201d answered her mother. \u201cNow go!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll the same I shan\u2019t sleep. What silliness, to sleep! Mummy! Mummy! such a thing never happened to me before,\u201d she said, surprised and alarmed at the feeling she was aware of in herself. \u201cAnd could we ever have thought!...\u201d\n\nIt seemed to Nat\u00e1sha that even at the time she first saw Prince Andrew at Otr\u00e1dnoe she had fallen in love with him. It was as if she feared this strange, unexpected happiness of meeting again the very man she had then chosen (she was firmly convinced she had done so) and of finding him, as it seemed, not indifferent to her.\n\n\u201cAnd it had to happen that he should come specially to Petersburg while we are here. And it had to happen that we should meet at that ball. It is fate. Clearly it is fate that everything led up to this! Already then, directly I saw him I felt something peculiar.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat else did he say to you? What are those verses? Read them...\u201d said her mother, thoughtfully, referring to some verses Prince Andrew had written in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s album.\n\n\u201cMamma, one need not be ashamed of his being a widower?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! Pray to God. \u2018Marriages are made in heaven,\u2019\u201d said her mother.\n\n\u201cDarling Mummy, how I love you! How happy I am!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, shedding tears of joy and excitement and embracing her mother.\n\nAt that very time Prince Andrew was sitting with Pierre and telling him of his love for Nat\u00e1sha and his firm resolve to make her his wife.\n\nThat day Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had a reception at her house. The French ambassador was there, and a foreign prince of the blood who had of late become a frequent visitor of hers, and many brilliant ladies and gentlemen. Pierre, who had come downstairs, walked through the rooms and struck everyone by his preoccupied, absent-minded, and morose air.\n\nSince the ball he had felt the approach of a fit of nervous depression and had made desperate efforts to combat it. Since the intimacy of his wife with the royal prince, Pierre had unexpectedly been made a gentleman of the bedchamber, and from that time he had begun to feel oppressed and ashamed in court society, and dark thoughts of the vanity of all things human came to him oftener than before. At the same time the feeling he had noticed between his prot\u00e9g\u00e9e Nat\u00e1sha and Prince Andrew accentuated his gloom by the contrast between his own position and his friend\u2019s. He tried equally to avoid thinking about his wife, and about Nat\u00e1sha and Prince Andrew; and again everything seemed to him insignificant in comparison with eternity; again the question: for what? presented itself; and he forced himself to work day and night at Masonic labors, hoping to drive away the evil spirit that threatened him. Toward midnight, after he had left the countess\u2019 apartments, he was sitting upstairs in a shabby dressing gown, copying out the original transaction of the Scottish lodge of Freemasons at a table in his low room cloudy with tobacco smoke, when someone came in. It was Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cAh, it\u2019s you!\u201d said Pierre with a preoccupied, dissatisfied air. \u201cAnd I, you see, am hard at it.\u201d He pointed to his manuscript book with that air of escaping from the ills of life with which unhappy people look at their work.\n\nPrince Andrew, with a beaming, ecstatic expression of renewed life on his face, paused in front of Pierre and, not noticing his sad look, smiled at him with the egotism of joy.\n\n\u201cWell, dear heart,\u201d said he, \u201cI wanted to tell you about it yesterday and I have come to do so today. I never experienced anything like it before. I am in love, my friend!\u201d\n\nSuddenly Pierre heaved a deep sigh and dumped his heavy person down on the sofa beside Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWith Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va, yes?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cYes, yes! Who else should it be? I should never have believed it, but the feeling is stronger than I. Yesterday I tormented myself and suffered, but I would not exchange even that torment for anything in the world, I have not lived till now. At last I live, but I can\u2019t live without her! But can she love me?... I am too old for her.... Why don\u2019t you speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? I? What did I tell you?\u201d said Pierre suddenly, rising and beginning to pace up and down the room. \u201cI always thought it.... That girl is such a treasure... she is a rare girl.... My dear friend, I entreat you, don\u2019t philosophize, don\u2019t doubt, marry, marry, marry.... And I am sure there will not be a happier man than you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what of her?\u201d\n\n\u201cShe loves you.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk rubbish...\u201d said Prince Andrew, smiling and looking into Pierre\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cShe does, I know,\u201d Pierre cried fiercely.\n\n\u201cBut do listen,\u201d returned Prince Andrew, holding him by the arm. \u201cDo you know the condition I am in? I must talk about it to someone.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, go on, go on. I am very glad,\u201d said Pierre, and his face really changed, his brow became smooth, and he listened gladly to Prince Andrew. Prince Andrew seemed, and really was, quite a different, quite a new man. Where was his spleen, his contempt for life, his disillusionment? Pierre was the only person to whom he made up his mind to speak openly; and to him he told all that was in his soul. Now he boldly and lightly made plans for an extended future, said he could not sacrifice his own happiness to his father\u2019s caprice, and spoke of how he would either make his father consent to this marriage and love her, or would do without his consent; then he marveled at the feeling that had mastered him as at something strange, apart from and independent of himself.\n\n\u201cI should not have believed anyone who told me that I was capable of such love,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cIt is not at all the same feeling that I knew in the past. The whole world is now for me divided into two halves: one half is she, and there all is joy, hope, light: the other half is everything where she is not, and there is all gloom and darkness....\u201d\n\n\u201cDarkness and gloom,\u201d reiterated Pierre: \u201cyes, yes, I understand that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot help loving the light, it is not my fault. And I am very happy! You understand me? I know you are glad for my sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d Pierre assented, looking at his friend with a touched and sad expression in his eyes. The brighter Prince Andrew\u2019s lot appeared to him, the gloomier seemed his own.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nPrince Andrew needed his father\u2019s consent to his marriage, and to obtain this he started for the country next day.\n\nHis father received his son\u2019s communication with external composure, but inward wrath. He could not comprehend how anyone could wish to alter his life or introduce anything new into it, when his own life was already ending. \u201cIf only they would let me end my days as I want to,\u201d thought the old man, \u201cthen they might do as they please.\u201d With his son, however, he employed the diplomacy he reserved for important occasions and, adopting a quiet tone, discussed the whole matter.\n\nIn the first place the marriage was not a brilliant one as regards birth, wealth, or rank. Secondly, Prince Andrew was no longer as young as he had been and his health was poor (the old man laid special stress on this), while she was very young. Thirdly, he had a son whom it would be a pity to entrust to a chit of a girl. \u201cFourthly and finally,\u201d the father said, looking ironically at his son, \u201cI beg you to put it off for a year: go abroad, take a cure, look out as you wanted to for a German tutor for Prince Nicholas. Then if your love or passion or obstinacy\u2014as you please\u2014is still as great, marry! And that\u2019s my last word on it. Mind, the last...\u201d concluded the prince, in a tone which showed that nothing would make him alter his decision.\n\nPrince Andrew saw clearly that the old man hoped that his feelings, or his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s, would not stand a year\u2019s test, or that he (the old prince himself) would die before then, and he decided to conform to his father\u2019s wish\u2014to propose, and postpone the wedding for a year.\n\nThree weeks after the last evening he had spent with the Rost\u00f3vs, Prince Andrew returned to Petersburg.\n\n\nNext day after her talk with her mother Nat\u00e1sha expected Bolk\u00f3nski all day, but he did not come. On the second and third day it was the same. Pierre did not come either and Nat\u00e1sha, not knowing that Prince Andrew had gone to see his father, could not explain his absence to herself.\n\nThree weeks passed in this way. Nat\u00e1sha had no desire to go out anywhere and wandered from room to room like a shadow, idle and listless; she wept secretly at night and did not go to her mother in the evenings. She blushed continually and was irritable. It seemed to her that everybody knew about her disappointment and was laughing at her and pitying her. Strong as was her inward grief, this wound to her vanity intensified her misery.\n\nOnce she came to her mother, tried to say something, and suddenly began to cry. Her tears were those of an offended child who does not know why it is being punished.\n\nThe countess began to soothe Nat\u00e1sha, who after first listening to her mother\u2019s words, suddenly interrupted her:\n\n\u201cLeave off, Mamma! I don\u2019t think, and don\u2019t want to think about it! He just came and then left off, left off....\u201d\n\nHer voice trembled, and she again nearly cried, but recovered and went on quietly:\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t at all want to get married. And I am afraid of him; I have now become quite calm, quite calm.\u201d\n\nThe day after this conversation Nat\u00e1sha put on the old dress which she knew had the peculiar property of conducing to cheerfulness in the mornings, and that day she returned to the old way of life which she had abandoned since the ball. Having finished her morning tea she went to the ballroom, which she particularly liked for its loud resonance, and began singing her solfeggio. When she had finished her first exercise she stood still in the middle of the room and sang a musical phrase that particularly pleased her. She listened joyfully (as though she had not expected it) to the charm of the notes reverberating, filling the whole empty ballroom, and slowly dying away; and all at once she felt cheerful. \u201cWhat\u2019s the good of making so much of it? Things are nice as it is,\u201d she said to herself, and she began walking up and down the room, not stepping simply on the resounding parquet but treading with each step from the heel to the toe (she had on a new and favorite pair of shoes) and listening to the regular tap of the heel and creak of the toe as gladly as she had to the sounds of her own voice. Passing a mirror she glanced into it. \u201cThere, that\u2019s me!\u201d the expression of her face seemed to say as she caught sight of herself. \u201cWell, and very nice too! I need nobody.\u201d\n\nA footman wanted to come in to clear away something in the room but she would not let him, and having closed the door behind him continued her walk. That morning she had returned to her favorite mood\u2014love of, and delight in, herself. \u201cHow charming that Nat\u00e1sha is!\u201d she said again, speaking as some third, collective, male person. \u201cPretty, a good voice, young, and in nobody\u2019s way if only they leave her in peace.\u201d But however much they left her in peace she could not now be at peace, and immediately felt this.\n\nIn the hall the porch door opened, and someone asked, \u201cAt home?\u201d and then footsteps were heard. Nat\u00e1sha was looking at the mirror, but did not see herself. She listened to the sounds in the hall. When she saw herself, her face was pale. It was he. She knew this for certain, though she hardly heard his voice through the closed doors.\n\nPale and agitated, Nat\u00e1sha ran into the drawing room.\n\n\u201cMamma! Bolk\u00f3nski has come!\u201d she said. \u201cMamma, it is awful, it is unbearable! I don\u2019t want... to be tormented? What am I to do?...\u201d\n\nBefore the countess could answer, Prince Andrew entered the room with an agitated and serious face. As soon as he saw Nat\u00e1sha his face brightened. He kissed the countess\u2019 hand and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s, and sat down beside the sofa.\n\n\u201cIt is long since we had the pleasure...\u201d began the countess, but Prince Andrew interrupted her by answering her intended question, obviously in haste to say what he had to.\n\n\u201cI have not been to see you all this time because I have been at my father\u2019s. I had to talk over a very important matter with him. I only got back last night,\u201d he said glancing at Nat\u00e1sha; \u201cI want to have a talk with you, Countess,\u201d he added after a moment\u2019s pause.\n\nThe countess lowered her eyes, sighing deeply.\n\n\u201cI am at your disposal,\u201d she murmured.\n\nNat\u00e1sha knew that she ought to go away, but was unable to do so: something gripped her throat, and regardless of manners she stared straight at Prince Andrew with wide-open eyes.\n\n\u201cAt once? This instant!... No, it can\u2019t be!\u201d she thought.\n\nAgain he glanced at her, and that glance convinced her that she was not mistaken. Yes, at once, that very instant, her fate would be decided.\n\n\u201cGo, Nat\u00e1sha! I will call you,\u201d said the countess in a whisper.\n\nNat\u00e1sha glanced with frightened imploring eyes at Prince Andrew and at her mother and went out.\n\n\u201cI have come, Countess, to ask for your daughter\u2019s hand,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\nThe countess\u2019 face flushed hotly, but she said nothing.\n\n\u201cYour offer...\u201d she began at last sedately. He remained silent, looking into her eyes. \u201cYour offer...\u201d (she grew confused) \u201cis agreeable to us, and I accept your offer. I am glad. And my husband... I hope... but it will depend on her....\u201d\n\n\u201cI will speak to her when I have your consent.... Do you give it to me?\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied the countess. She held out her hand to him, and with a mixed feeling of estrangement and tenderness pressed her lips to his forehead as he stooped to kiss her hand. She wished to love him as a son, but felt that to her he was a stranger and a terrifying man. \u201cI am sure my husband will consent,\u201d said the countess, \u201cbut your father...\u201d\n\n\u201cMy father, to whom I have told my plans, has made it an express condition of his consent that the wedding is not to take place for a year. And I wished to tell you of that,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cIt is true that Nat\u00e1sha is still young, but\u2014so long as that?...\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is unavoidable,\u201d said Prince Andrew with a sigh.\n\n\u201cI will send her to you,\u201d said the countess, and left the room.\n\n\u201cLord have mercy upon us!\u201d she repeated while seeking her daughter.\n\nS\u00f3nya said that Nat\u00e1sha was in her bedroom. Nat\u00e1sha was sitting on the bed, pale and dry-eyed, and was gazing at the icons and whispering something as she rapidly crossed herself. Seeing her mother she jumped up and flew to her.\n\n\u201cWell, Mamma?... Well?...\u201d\n\n\u201cGo, go to him. He is asking for your hand,\u201d said the countess, coldly it seemed to Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cGo... go,\u201d said the mother, sadly and reproachfully, with a deep sigh, as her daughter ran away.\n\nNat\u00e1sha never remembered how she entered the drawing room. When she came in and saw him she paused. \u201cIs it possible that this stranger has now become everything to me?\u201d she asked herself, and immediately answered, \u201cYes, everything! He alone is now dearer to me than everything in the world.\u201d Prince Andrew came up to her with downcast eyes.\n\n\u201cI have loved you from the very first moment I saw you. May I hope?\u201d\n\nHe looked at her and was struck by the serious impassioned expression of her face. Her face said: \u201cWhy ask? Why doubt what you cannot but know? Why speak, when words cannot express what one feels?\u201d\n\nShe drew near to him and stopped. He took her hand and kissed it.\n\n\u201cDo you love me?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha murmured as if in vexation. Then she sighed loudly and, catching her breath more and more quickly, began to sob.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I am so happy!\u201d she replied, smiled through her tears, bent over closer to him, paused for an instant as if asking herself whether she might, and then kissed him.\n\nPrince Andrew held her hands, looked into her eyes, and did not find in his heart his former love for her. Something in him had suddenly changed; there was no longer the former poetic and mystic charm of desire, but there was pity for her feminine and childish weakness, fear at her devotion and trustfulness, and an oppressive yet joyful sense of the duty that now bound him to her forever. The present feeling, though not so bright and poetic as the former, was stronger and more serious.\n\n\u201cDid your mother tell you that it cannot be for a year?\u201d asked Prince Andrew, still looking into her eyes.\n\n\u201cIs it possible that I\u2014the \u2018chit of a girl,\u2019 as everybody called me,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha\u2014\u201cis it possible that I am now to be the wife and the equal of this strange, dear, clever man whom even my father looks up to? Can it be true? Can it be true that there can be no more playing with life, that now I am grown up, that on me now lies a responsibility for my every word and deed? Yes, but what did he ask me?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she replied, but she had not understood his question.\n\n\u201cForgive me!\u201d he said. \u201cBut you are so young, and I have already been through so much in life. I am afraid for you, you do not yet know yourself.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha listened with concentrated attention, trying but failing to take in the meaning of his words.\n\n\u201cHard as this year which delays my happiness will be,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, \u201cit will give you time to be sure of yourself. I ask you to make me happy in a year, but you are free: our engagement shall remain a secret, and should you find that you do not love me, or should you come to love...\u201d said Prince Andrew with an unnatural smile.\n\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha interrupted him. \u201cYou know that from the very day you first came to Otr\u00e1dnoe I have loved you,\u201d she cried, quite convinced that she spoke the truth.\n\n\u201cIn a year you will learn to know yourself....\u201d\n\n\u201cA whole year!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha repeated suddenly, only now realizing that the marriage was to be postponed for a year. \u201cBut why a year? Why a year?...\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew began to explain to her the reasons for this delay. Nat\u00e1sha did not hear him.\n\n\u201cAnd can\u2019t it be helped?\u201d she asked. Prince Andrew did not reply, but his face expressed the impossibility of altering that decision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s awful! Oh, it\u2019s awful! awful!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly cried, and again burst into sobs. \u201cI shall die, waiting a year: it\u2019s impossible, it\u2019s awful!\u201d She looked into her lover\u2019s face and saw in it a look of commiseration and perplexity.\n\n\u201cNo, no! I\u2019ll do anything!\u201d she said, suddenly checking her tears. \u201cI am so happy.\u201d\n\nThe father and mother came into the room and gave the betrothed couple their blessing.\n\nFrom that day Prince Andrew began to frequent the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 as Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s affianced lover.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nNo betrothal ceremony took place and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s engagement to Bolk\u00f3nski was not announced; Prince Andrew insisted on that. He said that as he was responsible for the delay he ought to bear the whole burden of it; that he had given his word and bound himself forever, but that he did not wish to bind Nat\u00e1sha and gave her perfect freedom. If after six months she felt that she did not love him she would have full right to reject him. Naturally neither Nat\u00e1sha nor her parents wished to hear of this, but Prince Andrew was firm. He came every day to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, but did not behave to Nat\u00e1sha as an affianced lover: he did not use the familiar thou, but said you to her, and kissed only her hand. After their engagement, quite different, intimate, and natural relations sprang up between them. It was as if they had not known each other till now. Both liked to recall how they had regarded each other when as yet they were nothing to one another; they felt themselves now quite different beings: then they were artificial, now natural and sincere. At first the family felt some constraint in intercourse with Prince Andrew; he seemed a man from another world, and for a long time Nat\u00e1sha trained the family to get used to him, proudly assuring them all that he only appeared to be different, but was really just like all of them, and that she was not afraid of him and no one else ought to be. After a few days they grew accustomed to him, and without restraint in his presence pursued their usual way of life, in which he took his part. He could talk about rural economy with the count, fashions with the countess and Nat\u00e1sha, and about albums and fancywork with S\u00f3nya. Sometimes the household both among themselves and in his presence expressed their wonder at how it had all happened, and at the evident omens there had been of it: Prince Andrew\u2019s coming to Otr\u00e1dnoe and their coming to Petersburg, and the likeness between Nat\u00e1sha and Prince Andrew which her nurse had noticed on his first visit, and Andrew\u2019s encounter with Nicholas in 1805, and many other incidents betokening that it had to be.\n\nIn the house that poetic dullness and quiet reigned which always accompanies the presence of a betrothed couple. Often when all sitting together everyone kept silent. Sometimes the others would get up and go away and the couple, left alone, still remained silent. They rarely spoke of their future life. Prince Andrew was afraid and ashamed to speak of it. Nat\u00e1sha shared this as she did all his feelings, which she constantly divined. Once she began questioning him about his son. Prince Andrew blushed, as he often did now\u2014Nat\u00e1sha particularly liked it in him\u2014and said that his son would not live with them.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha in a frightened tone.\n\n\u201cI cannot take him away from his grandfather, and besides...\u201d\n\n\u201cHow I should have loved him!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, immediately guessing his thought; \u201cbut I know you wish to avoid any pretext for finding fault with us.\u201d\n\nSometimes the old count would come up, kiss Prince Andrew, and ask his advice about P\u00e9tya\u2019s education or Nicholas\u2019 service. The old countess sighed as she looked at them; S\u00f3nya was always getting frightened lest she should be in the way and tried to find excuses for leaving them alone, even when they did not wish it. When Prince Andrew spoke (he could tell a story very well), Nat\u00e1sha listened to him with pride; when she spoke she noticed with fear and joy that he gazed attentively and scrutinizingly at her. She asked herself in perplexity: \u201cWhat does he look for in me? He is trying to discover something by looking at me! What if what he seeks in me is not there?\u201d Sometimes she fell into one of the mad, merry moods characteristic of her, and then she particularly loved to hear and see how Prince Andrew laughed. He seldom laughed, but when he did he abandoned himself entirely to his laughter, and after such a laugh she always felt nearer to him. Nat\u00e1sha would have been completely happy if the thought of the separation awaiting her and drawing near had not terrified her, just as the mere thought of it made him turn pale and cold.\n\nOn the eve of his departure from Petersburg Prince Andrew brought with him Pierre, who had not been to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 once since the ball. Pierre seemed disconcerted and embarrassed. He was talking to the countess, and Nat\u00e1sha sat down beside a little chess table with S\u00f3nya, thereby inviting Prince Andrew to come too. He did so.\n\n\u201cYou have known Bez\u00fakhov a long time?\u201d he asked. \u201cDo you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a dear, but very absurd.\u201d\n\nAnd as usual when speaking of Pierre, she began to tell anecdotes of his absent-mindedness, some of which had even been invented about him.\n\n\u201cDo you know I have entrusted him with our secret? I have known him from childhood. He has a heart of gold. I beg you, Natalie,\u201d Prince Andrew said with sudden seriousness\u2014\u201cI am going away and heaven knows what may happen. You may cease to... all right, I know I am not to say that. Only this, then: whatever may happen to you when I am not here...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can happen?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhatever trouble may come,\u201d Prince Andrew continued, \u201cI beg you, Mademoiselle Sophie, whatever may happen, to turn to him alone for advice and help! He is a most absent-minded and absurd fellow, but he has a heart of gold.\u201d\n\nNeither her father, nor her mother, nor S\u00f3nya, nor Prince Andrew himself could have foreseen how the separation from her lover would act on Nat\u00e1sha. Flushed and agitated she went about the house all that day, dry-eyed, occupied with most trivial matters as if not understanding what awaited her. She did not even cry when, on taking leave, he kissed her hand for the last time. \u201cDon\u2019t go!\u201d she said in a tone that made him wonder whether he really ought not to stay and which he remembered long afterwards. Nor did she cry when he was gone; but for several days she sat in her room dry-eyed, taking no interest in anything and only saying now and then, \u201cOh, why did he go away?\u201d\n\nBut a fortnight after his departure, to the surprise of those around her, she recovered from her mental sickness just as suddenly and became her old self again, but with a change in her moral physiognomy, as a child gets up after a long illness with a changed expression of face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nDuring that year after his son\u2019s departure, Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s health and temper became much worse. He grew still more irritable, and it was Princess Mary who generally bore the brunt of his frequent fits of unprovoked anger. He seemed carefully to seek out her tender spots so as to torture her mentally as harshly as possible. Princess Mary had two passions and consequently two joys\u2014her nephew, little Nicholas, and religion\u2014and these were the favorite subjects of the prince\u2019s attacks and ridicule. Whatever was spoken of he would bring round to the superstitiousness of old maids, or the petting and spoiling of children. \u201cYou want to make him\u201d\u2014little Nicholas\u2014\u201cinto an old maid like yourself! A pity! Prince Andrew wants a son and not an old maid,\u201d he would say. Or, turning to Mademoiselle Bourienne, he would ask her in Princess Mary\u2019s presence how she liked our village priests and icons and would joke about them.\n\nHe continually hurt Princess Mary\u2019s feelings and tormented her, but it cost her no effort to forgive him. Could he be to blame toward her, or could her father, whom she knew loved her in spite of it all, be unjust? And what is justice? The princess never thought of that proud word \u201cjustice.\u201d All the complex laws of man centered for her in one clear and simple law\u2014the law of love and self-sacrifice taught us by Him who lovingly suffered for mankind though He Himself was God. What had she to do with the justice or injustice of other people? She had to endure and love, and that she did.\n\nDuring the winter Prince Andrew had come to Bald Hills and had been gay, gentle, and more affectionate than Princess Mary had known him for a long time past. She felt that something had happened to him, but he said nothing to her about his love. Before he left he had a long talk with his father about something, and Princess Mary noticed that before his departure they were dissatisfied with one another.\n\nSoon after Prince Andrew had gone, Princess Mary wrote to her friend Julie Kar\u00e1gina in Petersburg, whom she had dreamed (as all girls dream) of marrying to her brother, and who was at that time in mourning for her own brother, killed in Turkey.\n\nSorrow, it seems, is our common lot, my dear, tender friend Julie.\n\nYour loss is so terrible that I can only explain it to myself as a special providence of God who, loving you, wishes to try you and your excellent mother. Oh, my friend! Religion, and religion alone, can\u2014I will not say comfort us\u2014but save us from despair. Religion alone can explain to us what without its help man cannot comprehend: why, for what cause, kind and noble beings able to find happiness in life\u2014not merely harming no one but necessary to the happiness of others\u2014are called away to God, while cruel, useless, harmful persons, or such as are a burden to themselves and to others, are left living. The first death I saw, and one I shall never forget\u2014that of my dear sister-in-law\u2014left that impression on me. Just as you ask destiny why your splendid brother had to die, so I asked why that angel Lise, who not only never wronged anyone, but in whose soul there were never any unkind thoughts, had to die. And what do you think, dear friend? Five years have passed since then, and already I, with my petty understanding, begin to see clearly why she had to die, and in what way that death was but an expression of the infinite goodness of the Creator, whose every action, though generally incomprehensible to us, is but a manifestation of His infinite love for His creatures. Perhaps, I often think, she was too angelically innocent to have the strength to perform all a mother\u2019s duties. As a young wife she was irreproachable; perhaps she could not have been so as a mother. As it is, not only has she left us, and particularly Prince Andrew, with the purest regrets and memories, but probably she will there receive a place I dare not hope for myself. But not to speak of her alone, that early and terrible death has had the most beneficent influence on me and on my brother in spite of all our grief. Then, at the moment of our loss, these thoughts could not occur to me; I should then have dismissed them with horror, but now they are very clear and certain. I write all this to you, dear friend, only to convince you of the Gospel truth which has become for me a principle of life: not a single hair of our heads will fall without His will. And His will is governed only by infinite love for us, and so whatever befalls us is for our good.\n\nYou ask whether we shall spend next winter in Moscow. In spite of my wish to see you, I do not think so and do not want to do so. You will be surprised to hear that the reason for this is Buonaparte! The case is this: my father\u2019s health is growing noticeably worse, he cannot stand any contradiction and is becoming irritable. This irritability is, as you know, chiefly directed to political questions. He cannot endure the notion that Buonaparte is negotiating on equal terms with all the sovereigns of Europe and particularly with our own, the grandson of the Great Catherine! As you know, I am quite indifferent to politics, but from my father\u2019s remarks and his talks with Michael Iv\u00e1novich I know all that goes on in the world and especially about the honors conferred on Buonaparte, who only at Bald Hills in the whole world, it seems, is not accepted as a great man, still less as Emperor of France. And my father cannot stand this. It seems to me that it is chiefly because of his political views that my father is reluctant to speak of going to Moscow; for he foresees the encounters that would result from his way of expressing his views regardless of anybody. All the benefit he might derive from a course of treatment he would lose as a result of the disputes about Buonaparte which would be inevitable. In any case it will be decided very shortly.\n\nOur family life goes on in the old way except for my brother Andrew\u2019s absence. He, as I wrote you before, has changed very much of late. After his sorrow he only this year quite recovered his spirits. He has again become as I used to know him when a child: kind, affectionate, with that heart of gold to which I know no equal. He has realized, it seems to me, that life is not over for him. But together with this mental change he has grown physically much weaker. He has become thinner and more nervous. I am anxious about him and glad he is taking this trip abroad which the doctors recommended long ago. I hope it will cure him. You write that in Petersburg he is spoken of as one of the most active, cultivated, and capable of the young men. Forgive my vanity as a relation, but I never doubted it. The good he has done to everybody here, from his peasants up to the gentry, is incalculable. On his arrival in Petersburg he received only his due. I always wonder at the way rumors fly from Petersburg to Moscow, especially such false ones as that you write about\u2014I mean the report of my brother\u2019s betrothal to the little Rost\u00f3va. I do not think my brother will ever marry again, and certainly not her; and this is why: first, I know that though he rarely speaks about the wife he has lost, the grief of that loss has gone too deep in his heart for him ever to decide to give her a successor and our little angel a stepmother. Secondly because, as far as I know, that girl is not the kind of girl who could please Prince Andrew. I do not think he would choose her for a wife, and frankly I do not wish it. But I am running on too long and am at the end of my second sheet. Good-by, my dear friend. May God keep you in His holy and mighty care. My dear friend, Mademoiselle Bourienne, sends you kisses.\n\nMARY\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nIn the middle of the summer Princess Mary received an unexpected letter from Prince Andrew in Switzerland in which he gave her strange and surprising news. He informed her of his engagement to Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va. The whole letter breathed loving rapture for his betrothed and tender and confiding affection for his sister. He wrote that he had never loved as he did now and that only now did he understand and know what life was. He asked his sister to forgive him for not having told her of his resolve when he had last visited Bald Hills, though he had spoken of it to his father. He had not done so for fear Princess Mary should ask her father to give his consent, irritating him and having to bear the brunt of his displeasure without attaining her object. \u201cBesides,\u201d he wrote, \u201cthe matter was not then so definitely settled as it is now. My father then insisted on a delay of a year and now already six months, half of that period, have passed, and my resolution is firmer than ever. If the doctors did not keep me here at the spas I should be back in Russia, but as it is I have to postpone my return for three months. You know me and my relations with Father. I want nothing from him. I have been and always shall be independent; but to go against his will and arouse his anger, now that he may perhaps remain with us such a short time, would destroy half my happiness. I am now writing to him about the same question, and beg you to choose a good moment to hand him the letter and to let me know how he looks at the whole matter and whether there is hope that he may consent to reduce the term by four months.\u201d\n\nAfter long hesitations, doubts, and prayers, Princess Mary gave the letter to her father. The next day the old prince said to her quietly:\n\n\u201cWrite and tell your brother to wait till I am dead.... It won\u2019t be long\u2014I shall soon set him free.\u201d\n\nThe princess was about to reply, but her father would not let her speak and, raising his voice more and more, cried:\n\n\u201cMarry, marry, my boy!... A good family!... Clever people, eh? Rich, eh? Yes, a nice stepmother little Nicholas will have! Write and tell him that he may marry tomorrow if he likes. She will be little Nicholas\u2019 stepmother and I\u2019ll marry Bourienne!... Ha, ha, ha! He mustn\u2019t be without a stepmother either! Only one thing, no more women are wanted in my house\u2014let him marry and live by himself. Perhaps you will go and live with him too?\u201d he added, turning to Princess Mary. \u201cGo in heaven\u2019s name! Go out into the frost... the frost... the frost!\u201d\n\nAfter this outburst the prince did not speak any more about the matter. But repressed vexation at his son\u2019s poor-spirited behavior found expression in his treatment of his daughter. To his former pretexts for irony a fresh one was now added\u2014allusions to stepmothers and amiabilities to Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I marry her?\u201d he asked his daughter. \u201cShe\u2019ll make a splendid princess!\u201d\n\nAnd latterly, to her surprise and bewilderment, Princess Mary noticed that her father was really associating more and more with the Frenchwoman. She wrote to Prince Andrew about the reception of his letter, but comforted him with hopes of reconciling their father to the idea.\n\nLittle Nicholas and his education, her brother Andrew, and religion were Princess Mary\u2019s joys and consolations; but besides that, since everyone must have personal hopes, Princess Mary in the profoundest depths of her heart had a hidden dream and hope that supplied the chief consolation of her life. This comforting dream and hope were given her by God\u2019s folk\u2014the half-witted and other pilgrims who visited her without the prince\u2019s knowledge. The longer she lived, the more experience and observation she had of life, the greater was her wonder at the short-sightedness of men who seek enjoyment and happiness here on earth: toiling, suffering, struggling, and harming one another, to obtain that impossible, visionary, sinful happiness. Prince Andrew had loved his wife, she died, but that was not enough: he wanted to bind his happiness to another woman. Her father objected to this because he wanted a more distinguished and wealthier match for Andrew. And they all struggled and suffered and tormented one another and injured their souls, their eternal souls, for the attainment of benefits which endure but for an instant. Not only do we know this ourselves, but Christ, the Son of God, came down to earth and told us that this life is but for a moment and is a probation; yet we cling to it and think to find happiness in it. \u201cHow is it that no one realizes this?\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cNo one except these despised God\u2019s folk who, wallet on back, come to me by the back door, afraid of being seen by the prince, not for fear of ill-usage by him but for fear of causing him to sin. To leave family, home, and all the cares of worldly welfare, in order without clinging to anything to wander in hempen rags from place to place under an assumed name, doing no one any harm but praying for all\u2014for those who drive one away as well as for those who protect one: higher than that life and truth there is no life or truth!\u201d\n\nThere was one pilgrim, a quiet pockmarked little woman of fifty called Theodosia, who for over thirty years had gone about barefoot and worn heavy chains. Princess Mary was particularly fond of her. Once, when in a room with a lamp dimly lit before the icon Theodosia was talking of her life, the thought that Theodosia alone had found the true path of life suddenly came to Princess Mary with such force that she resolved to become a pilgrim herself. When Theodosia had gone to sleep Princess Mary thought about this for a long time, and at last made up her mind that, strange as it might seem, she must go on a pilgrimage. She disclosed this thought to no one but to her confessor, Father Ak\u00ednfi, the monk, and he approved of her intention. Under guise of a present for the pilgrims, Princess Mary prepared a pilgrim\u2019s complete costume for herself: a coarse smock, bast shoes, a rough coat, and a black kerchief. Often, approaching the chest of drawers containing this secret treasure, Princess Mary paused, uncertain whether the time had not already come to put her project into execution.\n\nOften, listening to the pilgrims\u2019 tales, she was so stimulated by their simple speech, mechanical to them but to her so full of deep meaning, that several times she was on the point of abandoning everything and running away from home. In imagination she already pictured herself by Theodosia\u2019s side, dressed in coarse rags, walking with a staff, a wallet on her back, along the dusty road, directing her wanderings from one saint\u2019s shrine to another, free from envy, earthly love, or desire, and reaching at last the place where there is no more sorrow or sighing, but eternal joy and bliss.\n\n\u201cI shall come to a place and pray there, and before having time to get used to it or getting to love it, I shall go farther. I will go on till my legs fail, and I\u2019ll lie down and die somewhere, and shall at last reach that eternal, quiet haven, where there is neither sorrow nor sighing...\u201d thought Princess Mary.\n\nBut afterwards, when she saw her father and especially little Koko (Nicholas), her resolve weakened. She wept quietly, and felt that she was a sinner who loved her father and little nephew more than God.\n\n\n\nBOOK SEVEN: 1810 - 11\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Bible legend tells us that the absence of labor\u2014idleness\u2014was a condition of the first man\u2019s blessedness before the Fall. Fallen man has retained a love of idleness, but the curse weighs on the race not only because we have to seek our bread in the sweat of our brows, but because our moral nature is such that we cannot be both idle and at ease. An inner voice tells us we are in the wrong if we are idle. If man could find a state in which he felt that though idle he was fulfilling his duty, he would have found one of the conditions of man\u2019s primitive blessedness. And such a state of obligatory and irreproachable idleness is the lot of a whole class\u2014the military. The chief attraction of military service has consisted and will consist in this compulsory and irreproachable idleness.\n\nNicholas Rost\u00f3v experienced this blissful condition to the full when, after 1807, he continued to serve in the P\u00e1vlograd regiment, in which he already commanded the squadron he had taken over from Den\u00edsov.\n\nRost\u00f3v had become a bluff, good-natured fellow, whom his Moscow acquaintances would have considered rather bad form, but who was liked and respected by his comrades, subordinates, and superiors, and was well contented with his life. Of late, in 1809, he found in letters from home more frequent complaints from his mother that their affairs were falling into greater and greater disorder, and that it was time for him to come back to gladden and comfort his old parents.\n\nReading these letters, Nicholas felt a dread of their wanting to take him away from surroundings in which, protected from all the entanglements of life, he was living so calmly and quietly. He felt that sooner or later he would have to re-enter that whirlpool of life, with its embarrassments and affairs to be straightened out, its accounts with stewards, quarrels, and intrigues, its ties, society, and with S\u00f3nya\u2019s love and his promise to her. It was all dreadfully difficult and complicated; and he replied to his mother in cold, formal letters in French, beginning: \u201cMy dear Mamma,\u201d and ending: \u201cYour obedient son,\u201d which said nothing of when he would return. In 1810 he received letters from his parents, in which they told him of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s engagement to Bolk\u00f3nski, and that the wedding would be in a year\u2019s time because the old prince made difficulties. This letter grieved and mortified Nicholas. In the first place he was sorry that Nat\u00e1sha, for whom he cared more than for anyone else in the family, should be lost to the home; and secondly, from his hussar point of view, he regretted not to have been there to show that fellow Bolk\u00f3nski that connection with him was no such great honor after all, and that if he loved Nat\u00e1sha he might dispense with permission from his dotard father. For a moment he hesitated whether he should not apply for leave in order to see Nat\u00e1sha before she was married, but then came the maneuvers, and considerations about S\u00f3nya and about the confusion of their affairs, and Nicholas again put it off. But in the spring of that year, he received a letter from his mother, written without his father\u2019s knowledge, and that letter persuaded him to return. She wrote that if he did not come and take matters in hand, their whole property would be sold by auction and they would all have to go begging. The count was so weak, and trusted M\u00edtenka so much, and was so good-natured, that everybody took advantage of him and things were going from bad to worse. \u201cFor God\u2019s sake, I implore you, come at once if you do not wish to make me and the whole family wretched,\u201d wrote the countess.\n\nThis letter touched Nicholas. He had that common sense of a matter-of-fact man which showed him what he ought to do.\n\nThe right thing now was, if not to retire from the service, at any rate to go home on leave. Why he had to go he did not know; but after his after-dinner nap he gave orders to saddle Mars, an extremely vicious gray stallion that had not been ridden for a long time, and when he returned with the horse all in a lather, he informed Lavr\u00fashka (Den\u00edsov\u2019s servant who had remained with him) and his comrades who turned up in the evening that he was applying for leave and was going home. Difficult and strange as it was for him to reflect that he would go away without having heard from the staff\u2014and this interested him extremely\u2014whether he was promoted to a captaincy or would receive the Order of St. Anne for the last maneuvers; strange as it was to think that he would go away without having sold his three roans to the Polish Count Golukhovski, who was bargaining for the horses Rost\u00f3v had betted he would sell for two thousand rubles; incomprehensible as it seemed that the ball the hussars were giving in honor of the Polish Mademoiselle Przazdziecka (out of rivalry to the Uhlans who had given one in honor of their Polish Mademoiselle Borzozowska) would take place without him\u2014he knew he must go away from this good, bright world to somewhere where everything was stupid and confused. A week later he obtained his leave. His hussar comrades\u2014not only those of his own regiment, but the whole brigade\u2014gave Rost\u00f3v a dinner to which the subscription was fifteen rubles a head, and at which there were two bands and two choirs of singers. Rost\u00f3v danced the Trep\u00e1k with Major B\u00e1sov; the tipsy officers tossed, embraced, and dropped Rost\u00f3v; the soldiers of the third squadron tossed him too, and shouted \u201churrah!\u201d and then they put him in his sleigh and escorted him as far as the first post station.\n\nDuring the first half of the journey\u2014from Kremench\u00fag to Kiev\u2014all Rost\u00f3v\u2019s thoughts, as is usual in such cases, were behind him, with the squadron; but when he had gone more than halfway he began to forget his three roans and Dozhoyv\u00e9yko, his quartermaster, and to wonder anxiously how things would be at Otr\u00e1dnoe and what he would find there. Thoughts of home grew stronger the nearer he approached it\u2014far stronger, as though this feeling of his was subject to the law by which the force of attraction is in inverse proportion to the square of the distance. At the last post station before Otr\u00e1dnoe he gave the driver a three-ruble tip, and on arriving he ran breathlessly, like a boy, up the steps of his home.\n\nAfter the rapture of meeting, and after that odd feeling of unsatisfied expectation\u2014the feeling that \u201ceverything is just the same, so why did I hurry?\u201d\u2014Nicholas began to settle down in his old home world. His father and mother were much the same, only a little older. What was new in them was a certain uneasiness and occasional discord, which there used not to be, and which, as Nicholas soon found out, was due to the bad state of their affairs. S\u00f3nya was nearly twenty; she had stopped growing prettier and promised nothing more than she was already, but that was enough. She exhaled happiness and love from the time Nicholas returned, and the faithful, unalterable love of this girl had a gladdening effect on him. P\u00e9tya and Nat\u00e1sha surprised Nicholas most. P\u00e9tya was a big handsome boy of thirteen, merry, witty, and mischievous, with a voice that was already breaking. As for Nat\u00e1sha, for a long while Nicholas wondered and laughed whenever he looked at her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re not the same at all,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHow? Am I uglier?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, but what dignity? A princess!\u201d he whispered to her.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, yes!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, joyfully.\n\nShe told him about her romance with Prince Andrew and of his visit to Otr\u00e1dnoe and showed him his last letter.\n\n\u201cWell, are you glad?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha asked. \u201cI am so tranquil and happy now.\u201d\n\n\u201cVery glad,\u201d answered Nicholas. \u201cHe is an excellent fellow.... And are you very much in love?\u201d\n\n\u201cHow shall I put it?\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI was in love with Bor\u00eds, with my teacher, and with Den\u00edsov, but this is quite different. I feel at peace and settled. I know that no better man than he exists, and I am calm and contented now. Not at all as before.\u201d\n\nNicholas expressed his disapproval of the postponement of the marriage for a year; but Nat\u00e1sha attacked her brother with exasperation, proving to him that it could not be otherwise, and that it would be a bad thing to enter a family against the father\u2019s will, and that she herself wished it so.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t at all understand,\u201d she said.\n\nNicholas was silent and agreed with her.\n\nHer brother often wondered as he looked at her. She did not seem at all like a girl in love and parted from her affianced husband. She was even-tempered and calm and quite as cheerful as of old. This amazed Nicholas and even made him regard Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s courtship skeptically. He could not believe that her fate was sealed, especially as he had not seen her with Prince Andrew. It always seemed to him that there was something not quite right about this intended marriage.\n\n\u201cWhy this delay? Why no betrothal?\u201d he thought. Once, when he had touched on this topic with his mother, he discovered, to his surprise and somewhat to his satisfaction, that in the depth of her soul she too had doubts about this marriage.\n\n\u201cYou see he writes,\u201d said she, showing her son a letter of Prince Andrew\u2019s, with that latent grudge a mother always has in regard to a daughter\u2019s future married happiness, \u201che writes that he won\u2019t come before December. What can be keeping him? Illness, probably! His health is very delicate. Don\u2019t tell Nat\u00e1sha. And don\u2019t attach importance to her being so bright: that\u2019s because she\u2019s living through the last days of her girlhood, but I know what she is like every time we receive a letter from him! However, God grant that everything turns out well!\u201d (She always ended with these words.) \u201cHe is an excellent man!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAfter reaching home Nicholas was at first serious and even dull. He was worried by the impending necessity of interfering in the stupid business matters for which his mother had called him home. To throw off this burden as quickly as possible, on the third day after his arrival he went, angry and scowling and without answering questions as to where he was going, to M\u00edtenka\u2019s lodge and demanded an account of everything. But what an account of everything might be Nicholas knew even less than the frightened and bewildered M\u00edtenka. The conversation and the examination of the accounts with M\u00edtenka did not last long. The village elder, a peasant delegate, and the village clerk, who were waiting in the passage, heard with fear and delight first the young count\u2019s voice roaring and snapping and rising louder and louder, and then words of abuse, dreadful words, ejaculated one after the other.\n\n\u201cRobber!... Ungrateful wretch!... I\u2019ll hack the dog to pieces! I\u2019m not my father!... Robbing us!...\u201d and so on.\n\nThen with no less fear and delight they saw how the young count, red in the face and with bloodshot eyes, dragged M\u00edtenka out by the scruff of the neck and applied his foot and knee to his behind with great agility at convenient moments between the words, shouting, \u201cBe off! Never let me see your face here again, you villain!\u201d\n\nM\u00edtenka flew headlong down the six steps and ran away into the shrubbery. (This shrubbery was a well-known haven of refuge for culprits at Otr\u00e1dnoe. M\u00edtenka himself, returning tipsy from the town, used to hide there, and many of the residents at Otr\u00e1dnoe, hiding from M\u00edtenka, knew of its protective qualities.)\n\nM\u00edtenka\u2019s wife and sisters-in-law thrust their heads and frightened faces out of the door of a room where a bright samovar was boiling and where the steward\u2019s high bedstead stood with its patchwork quilt.\n\nThe young count paid no heed to them, but, breathing hard, passed by with resolute strides and went into the house.\n\nThe countess, who heard at once from the maids what had happened at the lodge, was calmed by the thought that now their affairs would certainly improve, but on the other hand felt anxious as to the effect this excitement might have on her son. She went several times to his door on tiptoe and listened, as he lighted one pipe after another.\n\nNext day the old count called his son aside and, with an embarrassed smile, said to him:\n\n\u201cBut you know, my dear boy, it\u2019s a pity you got excited! M\u00edtenka has told me all about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI knew,\u201d thought Nicholas, \u201cthat I should never understand anything in this crazy world.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou were angry that he had not entered those 700 rubles. But they were carried forward\u2014and you did not look at the other page.\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa, he is a blackguard and a thief! I know he is! And what I have done, I have done; but, if you like, I won\u2019t speak to him again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my dear boy\u201d (the count, too, felt embarrassed. He knew he had mismanaged his wife\u2019s property and was to blame toward his children, but he did not know how to remedy it). \u201cNo, I beg you to attend to the business. I am old. I...\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Papa. Forgive me if I have caused you unpleasantness. I understand it all less than you do.\u201d\n\n\u201cDevil take all these peasants, and money matters, and carryings forward from page to page,\u201d he thought. \u201cI used to understand what a \u2018corner\u2019 and the stakes at cards meant, but carrying forward to another page I don\u2019t understand at all,\u201d said he to himself, and after that he did not meddle in business affairs. But once the countess called her son and informed him that she had a promissory note from Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna for two thousand rubles, and asked him what he thought of doing with it.\n\n\u201cThis,\u201d answered Nicholas. \u201cYou say it rests with me. Well, I don\u2019t like Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna and I don\u2019t like Bor\u00eds, but they were our friends and poor. Well then, this!\u201d and he tore up the note, and by so doing caused the old countess to weep tears of joy. After that, young Rost\u00f3v took no further part in any business affairs, but devoted himself with passionate enthusiasm to what was to him a new pursuit\u2014the chase\u2014for which his father kept a large establishment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe weather was already growing wintry and morning frosts congealed an earth saturated by autumn rains. The verdure had thickened and its bright green stood out sharply against the brownish strips of winter rye trodden down by the cattle, and against the pale-yellow stubble of the spring buckwheat. The wooded ravines and the copses, which at the end of August had still been green islands amid black fields and stubble, had become golden and bright-red islands amid the green winter rye. The hares had already half changed their summer coats, the fox cubs were beginning to scatter, and the young wolves were bigger than dogs. It was the best time of the year for the chase. The hounds of that ardent young sportsman Rost\u00f3v had not merely reached hard winter condition, but were so jaded that at a meeting of the huntsmen it was decided to give them a three days\u2019 rest and then, on the sixteenth of September, to go on a distant expedition, starting from the oak grove where there was an undisturbed litter of wolf cubs.\n\nAll that day the hounds remained at home. It was frosty and the air was sharp, but toward evening the sky became overcast and it began to thaw. On the fifteenth, when young Rost\u00f3v, in his dressing gown, looked out of the window, he saw it was an unsurpassable morning for hunting: it was as if the sky were melting and sinking to the earth without any wind. The only motion in the air was that of the dripping, microscopic particles of drizzling mist. The bare twigs in the garden were hung with transparent drops which fell on the freshly fallen leaves. The earth in the kitchen garden looked wet and black and glistened like poppy seed and at a short distance merged into the dull, moist veil of mist. Nicholas went out into the wet and muddy porch. There was a smell of decaying leaves and of dog. M\u00edlka, a black-spotted, broad-haunched bitch with prominent black eyes, got up on seeing her master, stretched her hind legs, lay down like a hare, and then suddenly jumped up and licked him right on his nose and mustache. Another borzoi, a dog, catching sight of his master from the garden path, arched his back and, rushing headlong toward the porch with lifted tail, began rubbing himself against his legs.\n\n\u201cO-hoy!\u201d came at that moment, that inimitable huntsman\u2019s call which unites the deepest bass with the shrillest tenor, and round the corner came Daniel the head huntsman and head kennelman, a gray, wrinkled old man with hair cut straight over his forehead, Ukrainian fashion, a long bent whip in his hand, and that look of independence and scorn of everything that is only seen in huntsmen. He doffed his Circassian cap to his master and looked at him scornfully. This scorn was not offensive to his master. Nicholas knew that this Daniel, disdainful of everybody and who considered himself above them, was all the same his serf and huntsman.\n\n\u201cDaniel!\u201d Nicholas said timidly, conscious at the sight of the weather, the hounds, and the huntsman that he was being carried away by that irresistible passion for sport which makes a man forget all his previous resolutions, as a lover forgets in the presence of his mistress.\n\n\u201cWhat orders, your excellency?\u201d said the huntsman in his deep bass, deep as a proto-deacon\u2019s and hoarse with hallooing\u2014and two flashing black eyes gazed from under his brows at his master, who was silent. \u201cCan you resist it?\u201d those eyes seemed to be asking.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good day, eh? For a hunt and a gallop, eh?\u201d asked Nicholas, scratching M\u00edlka behind the ears.\n\nDaniel did not answer, but winked instead.\n\n\u201cI sent Uv\u00e1rka at dawn to listen,\u201d his bass boomed out after a minute\u2019s pause. \u201cHe says she\u2019s moved them into the Otr\u00e1dnoe enclosure. They were howling there.\u201d (This meant that the she-wolf, about whom they both knew, had moved with her cubs to the Otr\u00e1dnoe copse, a small place a mile and a half from the house.)\n\n\u201cWe ought to go, don\u2019t you think so?\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cCome to me with Uv\u00e1rka.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs you please.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen put off feeding them.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir.\u201d\n\nFive minutes later Daniel and Uv\u00e1rka were standing in Nicholas\u2019 big study. Though Daniel was not a big man, to see him in a room was like seeing a horse or a bear on the floor among the furniture and surroundings of human life. Daniel himself felt this, and as usual stood just inside the door, trying to speak softly and not move, for fear of breaking something in the master\u2019s apartment, and he hastened to say all that was necessary so as to get from under that ceiling, out into the open under the sky once more.\n\nHaving finished his inquiries and extorted from Daniel an opinion that the hounds were fit (Daniel himself wished to go hunting), Nicholas ordered the horses to be saddled. But just as Daniel was about to go Nat\u00e1sha came in with rapid steps, not having done up her hair or finished dressing and with her old nurse\u2019s big shawl wrapped round her. P\u00e9tya ran in at the same time.\n\n\u201cYou are going?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI knew you would! S\u00f3nya said you wouldn\u2019t go, but I knew that today is the sort of day when you couldn\u2019t help going.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we are going,\u201d replied Nicholas reluctantly, for today, as he intended to hunt seriously, he did not want to take Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya. \u201cWe are going, but only wolf hunting: it would be dull for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know it is my greatest pleasure,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cIt\u2019s not fair; you are going by yourself, are having the horses saddled and said nothing to us about it.\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018No barrier bars a Russian\u2019s path\u2019\u2014we\u2019ll go!\u201d shouted P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t. Mamma said you mustn\u2019t,\u201d said Nicholas to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll go. I shall certainly go,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha decisively. \u201cDaniel, tell them to saddle for us, and Michael must come with my dogs,\u201d she added to the huntsman.\n\nIt seemed to Daniel irksome and improper to be in a room at all, but to have anything to do with a young lady seemed to him impossible. He cast down his eyes and hurried out as if it were none of his business, careful as he went not to inflict any accidental injury on the young lady.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe old count, who had always kept up an enormous hunting establishment but had now handed it all completely over to his son\u2019s care, being in very good spirits on this fifteenth of September, prepared to go out with the others.\n\nIn an hour\u2019s time the whole hunting party was at the porch. Nicholas, with a stern and serious air which showed that now was no time for attending to trifles, went past Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya who were trying to tell him something. He had a look at all the details of the hunt, sent a pack of hounds and huntsmen on ahead to find the quarry, mounted his chestnut Don\u00e9ts, and whistling to his own leash of borzois, set off across the threshing ground to a field leading to the Otr\u00e1dnoe wood. The old count\u2019s horse, a sorrel gelding called Vifly\u00e1nka, was led by the groom in attendance on him, while the count himself was to drive in a small trap straight to a spot reserved for him.\n\nThey were taking fifty-four hounds, with six hunt attendants and whippers-in. Besides the family, there were eight borzoi kennelmen and more than forty borzois, so that, with the borzois on the leash belonging to members of the family, there were about a hundred and thirty dogs and twenty horsemen.\n\nEach dog knew its master and its call. Each man in the hunt knew his business, his place, what he had to do. As soon as they had passed the fence they all spread out evenly and quietly, without noise or talk, along the road and field leading to the Otr\u00e1dnoe covert.\n\nThe horses stepped over the field as over a thick carpet, now and then splashing into puddles as they crossed a road. The misty sky still seemed to descend evenly and imperceptibly toward the earth, the air was still, warm, and silent. Occasionally the whistle of a huntsman, the snort of a horse, the crack of a whip, or the whine of a straggling hound could be heard.\n\nWhen they had gone a little less than a mile, five more riders with dogs appeared out of the mist, approaching the Rost\u00f3vs. In front rode a fresh-looking, handsome old man with a large gray mustache.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Uncle!\u201d said Nicholas, when the old man drew near.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it. Come on!... I was sure of it,\u201d began \u201cUncle.\u201d (He was a distant relative of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, a man of small means, and their neighbor.) \u201cI knew you wouldn\u2019t be able to resist it and it\u2019s a good thing you\u2019re going. That\u2019s it! Come on!\u201d (This was \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d favorite expression.) \u201cTake the covert at once, for my G\u00edrchik says the Il\u00e1gins are at Kornik\u00ed with their hounds. That\u2019s it. Come on!... They\u2019ll take the cubs from under your very nose.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where I\u2019m going. Shall we join up our packs?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\nThe hounds were joined into one pack, and \u201cUncle\u201d and Nicholas rode on side by side. Nat\u00e1sha, muffled up in shawls which did not hide her eager face and shining eyes, galloped up to them. She was followed by P\u00e9tya who always kept close to her, by Michael, a huntsman, and by a groom appointed to look after her. P\u00e9tya, who was laughing, whipped and pulled at his horse. Nat\u00e1sha sat easily and confidently on her black Ar\u00e1bchik and reined him in without effort with a firm hand.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d looked round disapprovingly at P\u00e9tya and Nat\u00e1sha. He did not like to combine frivolity with the serious business of hunting.\n\n\u201cGood morning, Uncle! We are going too!\u201d shouted P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cGood morning, good morning! But don\u2019t go overriding the hounds,\u201d said \u201cUncle\u201d sternly.\n\n\u201cNicholas, what a fine dog Trun\u00edla is! He knew me,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, referring to her favorite hound.\n\n\u201cIn the first place, Trun\u00edla is not a \u2018dog,\u2019 but a harrier,\u201d thought Nicholas, and looked sternly at his sister, trying to make her feel the distance that ought to separate them at that moment. Nat\u00e1sha understood it.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t think we\u2019ll be in anyone\u2019s way, Uncle,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ll go to our places and won\u2019t budge.\u201d\n\n\u201cA good thing too, little countess,\u201d said \u201cUncle,\u201d \u201conly mind you don\u2019t fall off your horse,\u201d he added, \u201cbecause\u2014that\u2019s it, come on!\u2014you\u2019ve nothing to hold on to.\u201d\n\nThe oasis of the Otr\u00e1dnoe covert came in sight a few hundred yards off, the huntsmen were already nearing it. Rost\u00f3v, having finally settled with \u201cUncle\u201d where they should set on the hounds, and having shown Nat\u00e1sha where she was to stand\u2014a spot where nothing could possibly run out\u2014went round above the ravine.\n\n\u201cWell, nephew, you\u2019re going for a big wolf,\u201d said \u201cUncle.\u201d \u201cMind and don\u2019t let her slip!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s as may happen,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v. \u201cKar\u00e1y, here!\u201d he shouted, answering \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d remark by this call to his borzoi. Kar\u00e1y was a shaggy old dog with a hanging jowl, famous for having tackled a big wolf unaided. They all took up their places.\n\nThe old count, knowing his son\u2019s ardor in the hunt, hurried so as not to be late, and the huntsmen had not yet reached their places when Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, cheerful, flushed, and with quivering cheeks, drove up with his black horses over the winter rye to the place reserved for him, where a wolf might come out. Having straightened his coat and fastened on his hunting knives and horn, he mounted his good, sleek, well-fed, and comfortable horse, Vifly\u00e1nka, which was turning gray, like himself. His horses and trap were sent home. Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, though not at heart a keen sportsman, knew the rules of the hunt well, and rode to the bushy edge of the road where he was to stand, arranged his reins, settled himself in the saddle, and, feeling that he was ready, looked about with a smile.\n\nBeside him was Simon Chekm\u00e1r, his personal attendant, an old horseman now somewhat stiff in the saddle. Chekm\u00e1r held in leash three formidable wolfhounds, who had, however, grown fat like their master and his horse. Two wise old dogs lay down unleashed. Some hundred paces farther along the edge of the wood stood M\u00edtka, the count\u2019s other groom, a daring horseman and keen rider to hounds. Before the hunt, by old custom, the count had drunk a silver cupful of mulled brandy, taken a snack, and washed it down with half a bottle of his favorite Bordeaux.\n\nHe was somewhat flushed with the wine and the drive. His eyes were rather moist and glittered more than usual, and as he sat in his saddle, wrapped up in his fur coat, he looked like a child taken out for an outing.\n\nThe thin, hollow-cheeked Chekm\u00e1r, having got everything ready, kept glancing at his master with whom he had lived on the best of terms for thirty years, and understanding the mood he was in expected a pleasant chat. A third person rode up circumspectly through the wood (it was plain that he had had a lesson) and stopped behind the count. This person was a gray-bearded old man in a woman\u2019s cloak, with a tall peaked cap on his head. He was the buffoon, who went by a woman\u2019s name, Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna.\n\n\u201cWell, Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna!\u201d whispered the count, winking at him. \u201cIf you scare away the beast, Daniel\u2019ll give it you!\u201d\n\n\u201cI know a thing or two myself!\u201d said Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna.\n\n\u201cHush!\u201d whispered the count and turned to Simon. \u201cHave you seen the young countess?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cWith young Count Peter, by the Zh\u00e1rov rank grass,\u201d answered Simon, smiling. \u201cThough she\u2019s a lady, she\u2019s very fond of hunting.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd you\u2019re surprised at the way she rides, Simon, eh?\u201d said the count. \u201cShe\u2019s as good as many a man!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course! It\u2019s marvelous. So bold, so easy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd Nicholas? Where is he? By the Ly\u00e1dov upland, isn\u2019t he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sir. He knows where to stand. He understands the matter so well that Daniel and I are often quite astounded,\u201d said Simon, well knowing what would please his master.\n\n\u201cRides well, eh? And how well he looks on his horse, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cA perfect picture! How he chased a fox out of the rank grass by the Zav\u00e1rzinsk thicket the other day! Leaped a fearful place; what a sight when they rushed from the covert... the horse worth a thousand rubles and the rider beyond all price! Yes, one would have to search far to find another as smart.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo search far...\u201d repeated the count, evidently sorry Simon had not said more. \u201cTo search far,\u201d he said, turning back the skirt of his coat to get at his snuffbox.\n\n\u201cThe other day when he came out from Mass in full uniform, Michael Sid\u00f3rych...\u201d Simon did not finish, for on the still air he had distinctly caught the music of the hunt with only two or three hounds giving tongue. He bent down his head and listened, shaking a warning finger at his master. \u201cThey are on the scent of the cubs...\u201d he whispered, \u201cstraight to the Ly\u00e1dov uplands.\u201d\n\nThe count, forgetting to smooth out the smile on his face, looked into the distance straight before him, down the narrow open space, holding the snuffbox in his hand but not taking any. After the cry of the hounds came the deep tones of the wolf call from Daniel\u2019s hunting horn; the pack joined the first three hounds and they could be heard in full cry, with that peculiar lift in the note that indicates that they are after a wolf. The whippers-in no longer set on the hounds, but changed to the cry of ulyulyu, and above the others rose Daniel\u2019s voice, now a deep bass, now piercingly shrill. His voice seemed to fill the whole wood and carried far beyond out into the open field.\n\nAfter listening a few moments in silence, the count and his attendant convinced themselves that the hounds had separated into two packs: the sound of the larger pack, eagerly giving tongue, began to die away in the distance, the other pack rushed by the wood past the count, and it was with this that Daniel\u2019s voice was heard calling ulyulyu. The sounds of both packs mingled and broke apart again, but both were becoming more distant.\n\nSimon sighed and stooped to straighten the leash a young borzoi had entangled; the count too sighed and, noticing the snuffbox in his hand, opened it and took a pinch. \u201cBack!\u201d cried Simon to a borzoi that was pushing forward out of the wood. The count started and dropped the snuffbox. Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna dismounted to pick it up. The count and Simon were looking at him.\n\nThen, unexpectedly, as often happens, the sound of the hunt suddenly approached, as if the hounds in full cry and Daniel ulyulyuing were just in front of them.\n\nThe count turned and saw on his right M\u00edtka staring at him with eyes starting out of his head, raising his cap and pointing before him to the other side.\n\n\u201cLook out!\u201d he shouted, in a voice plainly showing that he had long fretted to utter that word, and letting the borzois slip he galloped toward the count.\n\nThe count and Simon galloped out of the wood and saw on their left a wolf which, softly swaying from side to side, was coming at a quiet lope farther to the left to the very place where they were standing. The angry borzois whined and getting free of the leash rushed past the horses\u2019 feet at the wolf.\n\nThe wolf paused, turned its heavy forehead toward the dogs awkwardly, like a man suffering from the quinsy, and, still slightly swaying from side to side, gave a couple of leaps and with a swish of its tail disappeared into the skirt of the wood. At the same instant, with a cry like a wail, first one hound, then another, and then another, sprang helter-skelter from the wood opposite and the whole pack rushed across the field toward the very spot where the wolf had disappeared. The hazel bushes parted behind the hounds and Daniel\u2019s chestnut horse appeared, dark with sweat. On its long back sat Daniel, hunched forward, capless, his disheveled gray hair hanging over his flushed, perspiring face.\n\n\u201cUlyulyulyu! ulyulyu!...\u201d he cried. When he caught sight of the count his eyes flashed lightning.\n\n\u201cBlast you!\u201d he shouted, holding up his whip threateningly at the count.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve let the wolf go!... What sportsmen!\u201d and as if scorning to say more to the frightened and shamefaced count, he lashed the heaving flanks of his sweating chestnut gelding with all the anger the count had aroused and flew off after the hounds. The count, like a punished schoolboy, looked round, trying by a smile to win Simon\u2019s sympathy for his plight. But Simon was no longer there. He was galloping round by the bushes while the field was coming up on both sides, all trying to head the wolf, but it vanished into the wood before they could do so.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNicholas Rost\u00f3v meanwhile remained at his post, waiting for the wolf. By the way the hunt approached and receded, by the cries of the dogs whose notes were familiar to him, by the way the voices of the huntsmen approached, receded, and rose, he realized what was happening at the copse. He knew that young and old wolves were there, that the hounds had separated into two packs, that somewhere a wolf was being chased, and that something had gone wrong. He expected the wolf to come his way any moment. He made thousands of different conjectures as to where and from what side the beast would come and how he would set upon it. Hope alternated with despair. Several times he addressed a prayer to God that the wolf should come his way. He prayed with that passionate and shamefaced feeling with which men pray at moments of great excitement arising from trivial causes. \u201cWhat would it be to Thee to do this for me?\u201d he said to God. \u201cI know Thou art great, and that it is a sin to ask this of Thee, but for God\u2019s sake do let the old wolf come my way and let Kar\u00e1y spring at it\u2014in sight of \u2018Uncle\u2019 who is watching from over there\u2014and seize it by the throat in a death grip!\u201d A thousand times during that half-hour Rost\u00f3v cast eager and restless glances over the edge of the wood, with the two scraggy oaks rising above the aspen undergrowth and the gully with its water-worn side and \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d cap just visible above the bush on his right.\n\n\u201cNo, I shan\u2019t have such luck,\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, \u201cyet what wouldn\u2019t it be worth! It is not to be! Everywhere, at cards and in war, I am always unlucky.\u201d Memories of Austerlitz and of D\u00f3lokhov flashed rapidly and clearly through his mind. \u201cOnly once in my life to get an old wolf, I want only that!\u201d thought he, straining eyes and ears and looking to the left and then to the right and listening to the slightest variation of note in the cries of the dogs.\n\nAgain he looked to the right and saw something running toward him across the deserted field. \u201cNo, it can\u2019t be!\u201d thought Rost\u00f3v, taking a deep breath, as a man does at the coming of something long hoped for. The height of happiness was reached\u2014and so simply, without warning, or noise, or display, that Rost\u00f3v could not believe his eyes and remained in doubt for over a second. The wolf ran forward and jumped heavily over a gully that lay in her path. She was an old animal with a gray back and big reddish belly. She ran without hurry, evidently feeling sure that no one saw her. Rost\u00f3v, holding his breath, looked round at the borzois. They stood or lay not seeing the wolf or understanding the situation. Old Kar\u00e1y had turned his head and was angrily searching for fleas, baring his yellow teeth and snapping at his hind legs.\n\n\u201cUlyulyulyu!\u201d whispered Rost\u00f3v, pouting his lips. The borzois jumped up, jerking the rings of the leashes and pricking their ears. Kar\u00e1y finished scratching his hindquarters and, cocking his ears, got up with quivering tail from which tufts of matted hair hung down.\n\n\u201cShall I loose them or not?\u201d Nicholas asked himself as the wolf approached him coming from the copse. Suddenly the wolf\u2019s whole physiognomy changed: she shuddered, seeing what she had probably never seen before\u2014human eyes fixed upon her\u2014and turning her head a little toward Rost\u00f3v, she paused.\n\n\u201cBack or forward? Eh, no matter, forward...\u201d the wolf seemed to say to herself, and she moved forward without again looking round and with a quiet, long, easy yet resolute lope.\n\n\u201cUlyulyu!\u201d cried Nicholas, in a voice not his own, and of its own accord his good horse darted headlong downhill, leaping over gullies to head off the wolf, and the borzois passed it, running faster still. Nicholas did not hear his own cry nor feel that he was galloping, nor see the borzois, nor the ground over which he went: he saw only the wolf, who, increasing her speed, bounded on in the same direction along the hollow. The first to come into view was M\u00edlka, with her black markings and powerful quarters, gaining upon the wolf. Nearer and nearer... now she was ahead of it; but the wolf turned its head to face her, and instead of putting on speed as she usually did M\u00edlka suddenly raised her tail and stiffened her forelegs.\n\n\u201cUlyulyulyulyu!\u201d shouted Nicholas.\n\nThe reddish Lyub\u00edm rushed forward from behind M\u00edlka, sprang impetuously at the wolf, and seized it by its hindquarters, but immediately jumped aside in terror. The wolf crouched, gnashed her teeth, and again rose and bounded forward, followed at the distance of a couple of feet by all the borzois, who did not get any closer to her.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll get away! No, it\u2019s impossible!\u201d thought Nicholas, still shouting with a hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cKar\u00e1y, ulyulyu!...\u201d he shouted, looking round for the old borzoi who was now his only hope. Kar\u00e1y, with all the strength age had left him, stretched himself to the utmost and, watching the wolf, galloped heavily aside to intercept it. But the quickness of the wolf\u2019s lope and the borzoi\u2019s slower pace made it plain that Kar\u00e1y had miscalculated. Nicholas could already see not far in front of him the wood where the wolf would certainly escape should she reach it. But, coming toward him, he saw hounds and a huntsman galloping almost straight at the wolf. There was still hope. A long, yellowish young borzoi, one Nicholas did not know, from another leash, rushed impetuously at the wolf from in front and almost knocked her over. But the wolf jumped up more quickly than anyone could have expected and, gnashing her teeth, flew at the yellowish borzoi, which, with a piercing yelp, fel", "sequence": 12}, {"offset": 1300000, "text": "l with its head on the ground, bleeding from a gash in its side.\n\n\u201cKar\u00e1y? Old fellow!...\u201d wailed Nicholas.\n\nThanks to the delay caused by this crossing of the wolf\u2019s path, the old dog with its felted hair hanging from its thigh was within five paces of it. As if aware of her danger, the wolf turned her eyes on Kar\u00e1y, tucked her tail yet further between her legs, and increased her speed. But here Nicholas only saw that something happened to Kar\u00e1y\u2014the borzoi was suddenly on the wolf, and they rolled together down into a gully just in front of them.\n\nThat instant, when Nicholas saw the wolf struggling in the gully with the dogs, while from under them could be seen her gray hair and outstretched hind leg and her frightened choking head, with her ears laid back (Kar\u00e1y was pinning her by the throat), was the happiest moment of his life. With his hand on his saddlebow, he was ready to dismount and stab the wolf, when she suddenly thrust her head up from among that mass of dogs, and then her forepaws were on the edge of the gully. She clicked her teeth (Kar\u00e1y no longer had her by the throat), leaped with a movement of her hind legs out of the gully, and having disengaged herself from the dogs, with tail tucked in again, went forward. Kar\u00e1y, his hair bristling, and probably bruised or wounded, climbed with difficulty out of the gully.\n\n\u201cOh my God! Why?\u201d Nicholas cried in despair.\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d huntsman was galloping from the other side across the wolf\u2019s path and his borzois once more stopped the animal\u2019s advance. She was again hemmed in.\n\nNicholas and his attendant, with \u201cUncle\u201d and his huntsman, were all riding round the wolf, crying \u201culyulyu!\u201d shouting and preparing to dismount each moment that the wolf crouched back, and starting forward again every time she shook herself and moved toward the wood where she would be safe.\n\nAlready, at the beginning of this chase, Daniel, hearing the ulyulyuing, had rushed out from the wood. He saw Kar\u00e1y seize the wolf, and checked his horse, supposing the affair to be over. But when he saw that the horsemen did not dismount and that the wolf shook herself and ran for safety, Daniel set his chestnut galloping, not at the wolf but straight toward the wood, just as Kar\u00e1y had run to cut the animal off. As a result of this, he galloped up to the wolf just when she had been stopped a second time by \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d borzois.\n\nDaniel galloped up silently, holding a naked dagger in his left hand and thrashing the laboring sides of his chestnut horse with his whip as if it were a flail.\n\nNicholas neither saw nor heard Daniel until the chestnut, breathing heavily, panted past him, and he heard the fall of a body and saw Daniel lying on the wolf\u2019s back among the dogs, trying to seize her by the ears. It was evident to the dogs, the hunters, and to the wolf herself that all was now over. The terrified wolf pressed back her ears and tried to rise, but the borzois stuck to her. Daniel rose a little, took a step, and with his whole weight, as if lying down to rest, fell on the wolf, seizing her by the ears. Nicholas was about to stab her, but Daniel whispered, \u201cDon\u2019t! We\u2019ll gag her!\u201d and, changing his position, set his foot on the wolf\u2019s neck. A stick was thrust between her jaws and she was fastened with a leash, as if bridled, her legs were bound together, and Daniel rolled her over once or twice from side to side.\n\nWith happy, exhausted faces, they laid the old wolf, alive, on a shying and snorting horse and, accompanied by the dogs yelping at her, took her to the place where they were all to meet. The hounds had killed two of the cubs and the borzois three. The huntsmen assembled with their booty and their stories, and all came to look at the wolf, which, with her broad-browed head hanging down and the bitten stick between her jaws, gazed with great glassy eyes at this crowd of dogs and men surrounding her. When she was touched, she jerked her bound legs and looked wildly yet simply at everybody. Old Count Rost\u00f3v also rode up and touched the wolf.\n\n\u201cOh, what a formidable one!\u201d said he. \u201cA formidable one, eh?\u201d he asked Daniel, who was standing near.\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency,\u201d answered Daniel, quickly doffing his cap.\n\nThe count remembered the wolf he had let slip and his encounter with Daniel.\n\n\u201cAh, but you are a crusty fellow, friend!\u201d said the count.\n\nFor sole reply Daniel gave him a shy, childlike, meek, and amiable smile.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe old count went home, and Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya promised to return very soon, but as it was still early the hunt went farther. At midday they put the hounds into a ravine thickly overgrown with young trees. Nicholas standing in a fallow field could see all his whips.\n\nFacing him lay a field of winter rye, there his own huntsman stood alone in a hollow behind a hazel bush. The hounds had scarcely been loosed before Nicholas heard one he knew, Volt\u00f3rn, giving tongue at intervals; other hounds joined in, now pausing and now again giving tongue. A moment later he heard a cry from the wooded ravine that a fox had been found, and the whole pack, joining together, rushed along the ravine toward the ryefield and away from Nicholas.\n\nHe saw the whips in their red caps galloping along the edge of the ravine, he even saw the hounds, and was expecting a fox to show itself at any moment on the ryefield opposite.\n\nThe huntsman standing in the hollow moved and loosed his borzois, and Nicholas saw a queer, short-legged red fox with a fine brush going hard across the field. The borzois bore down on it.... Now they drew close to the fox which began to dodge between the field in sharper and sharper curves, trailing its brush, when suddenly a strange white borzoi dashed in followed by a black one, and everything was in confusion; the borzois formed a star-shaped figure, scarcely swaying their bodies and with tails turned away from the center of the group. Two huntsmen galloped up to the dogs; one in a red cap, the other, a stranger, in a green coat.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d thought Nicholas. \u201cWhere\u2019s that huntsman from? He is not \u2018Uncle\u2019s\u2019 man.\u201d\n\nThe huntsmen got the fox, but stayed there a long time without strapping it to the saddle. Their horses, bridled and with high saddles, stood near them and there too the dogs were lying. The huntsmen waved their arms and did something to the fox. Then from that spot came the sound of a horn, with the signal agreed on in case of a fight.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Il\u00e1gin\u2019s huntsman having a row with our Iv\u00e1n,\u201d said Nicholas\u2019 groom.\n\nNicholas sent the man to call Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya to him, and rode at a footpace to the place where the whips were getting the hounds together. Several of the field galloped to the spot where the fight was going on.\n\nNicholas dismounted, and with Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya, who had ridden up, stopped near the hounds, waiting to see how the matter would end. Out of the bushes came the huntsman who had been fighting and rode toward his young master, with the fox tied to his crupper. While still at a distance he took off his cap and tried to speak respectfully, but he was pale and breathless and his face was angry. One of his eyes was black, but he probably was not even aware of it.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cA likely thing, killing a fox our dogs had hunted! And it was my gray bitch that caught it! Go to law, indeed!... He snatches at the fox! I gave him one with the fox. Here it is on my saddle! Do you want a taste of this?...\u201d said the huntsman, pointing to his dagger and probably imagining himself still speaking to his foe.\n\nNicholas, not stopping to talk to the man, asked his sister and P\u00e9tya to wait for him and rode to the spot where the enemy\u2019s, Il\u00e1gin\u2019s, hunting party was.\n\nThe victorious huntsman rode off to join the field, and there, surrounded by inquiring sympathizers, recounted his exploits.\n\nThe facts were that Il\u00e1gin, with whom the Rost\u00f3vs had a quarrel and were at law, hunted over places that belonged by custom to the Rost\u00f3vs, and had now, as if purposely, sent his men to the very woods the Rost\u00f3vs were hunting and let his man snatch a fox their dogs had chased.\n\nNicholas, though he had never seen Il\u00e1gin, with his usual absence of moderation in judgment, hated him cordially from reports of his arbitrariness and violence, and regarded him as his bitterest foe. He rode in angry agitation toward him, firmly grasping his whip and fully prepared to take the most resolute and desperate steps to punish his enemy.\n\nHardly had he passed an angle of the wood before a stout gentleman in a beaver cap came riding toward him on a handsome raven-black horse, accompanied by two hunt servants.\n\nInstead of an enemy, Nicholas found in Il\u00e1gin a stately and courteous gentleman who was particularly anxious to make the young count\u2019s acquaintance. Having ridden up to Nicholas, Il\u00e1gin raised his beaver cap and said he much regretted what had occurred and would have the man punished who had allowed himself to seize a fox hunted by someone else\u2019s borzois. He hoped to become better acquainted with the count and invited him to draw his covert.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, afraid that her brother would do something dreadful, had followed him in some excitement. Seeing the enemies exchanging friendly greetings, she rode up to them. Il\u00e1gin lifted his beaver cap still higher to Nat\u00e1sha and said, with a pleasant smile, that the young countess resembled Diana in her passion for the chase as well as in her beauty, of which he had heard much.\n\nTo expiate his huntsman\u2019s offense, Il\u00e1gin pressed the Rost\u00f3vs to come to an upland of his about a mile away which he usually kept for himself and which, he said, swarmed with hares. Nicholas agreed, and the hunt, now doubled, moved on.\n\nThe way to Iligin\u2019s upland was across the fields. The hunt servants fell into line. The masters rode together. \u201cUncle,\u201d Rost\u00f3v, and Il\u00e1gin kept stealthily glancing at one another\u2019s dogs, trying not to be observed by their companions and searching uneasily for rivals to their own borzois.\n\nRost\u00f3v was particularly struck by the beauty of a small, pure-bred, red-spotted bitch on Il\u00e1gin\u2019s leash, slender but with muscles like steel, a delicate muzzle, and prominent black eyes. He had heard of the swiftness of Il\u00e1gin\u2019s borzois, and in that beautiful bitch saw a rival to his own M\u00edlka.\n\nIn the middle of a sober conversation begun by Il\u00e1gin about the year\u2019s harvest, Nicholas pointed to the red-spotted bitch.\n\n\u201cA fine little bitch, that!\u201d said he in a careless tone. \u201cIs she swift?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat one? Yes, she\u2019s a good dog, gets what she\u2019s after,\u201d answered Il\u00e1gin indifferently, of the red-spotted bitch Erz\u00e1, for which, a year before, he had given a neighbor three families of house serfs. \u201cSo in your parts, too, the harvest is nothing to boast of, Count?\u201d he went on, continuing the conversation they had begun. And considering it polite to return the young count\u2019s compliment, Il\u00e1gin looked at his borzois and picked out M\u00edlka who attracted his attention by her breadth. \u201cThat black-spotted one of yours is fine\u2014well shaped!\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cYes, she\u2019s fast enough,\u201d replied Nicholas, and thought: \u201cIf only a full-grown hare would cross the field now I\u2019d show you what sort of borzoi she is,\u201d and turning to his groom, he said he would give a ruble to anyone who found a hare.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d continued Il\u00e1gin, \u201chow some sportsmen can be so jealous about game and dogs. For myself, I can tell you, Count, I enjoy riding in company such as this... what could be better?\u201d (he again raised his cap to Nat\u00e1sha) \u201cbut as for counting skins and what one takes, I don\u2019t care about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d\n\n\u201cOr being upset because someone else\u2019s borzoi and not mine catches something. All I care about is to enjoy seeing the chase, is it not so, Count? For I consider that...\u201d\n\n\u201cA-tu!\u201d came the long-drawn cry of one of the borzoi whippers-in, who had halted. He stood on a knoll in the stubble, holding his whip aloft, and again repeated his long-drawn cry, \u201cA-tu!\u201d (This call and the uplifted whip meant that he saw a sitting hare.)\n\n\u201cAh, he has found one, I think,\u201d said Il\u00e1gin carelessly. \u201cYes, we must ride up.... Shall we both course it?\u201d answered Nicholas, seeing in Erz\u00e1 and \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d red Rug\u00e1y two rivals he had never yet had a chance of pitting against his own borzois. \u201cAnd suppose they outdo my M\u00edlka at once!\u201d he thought as he rode with \u201cUncle\u201d and Il\u00e1gin toward the hare.\n\n\u201cA full-grown one?\u201d asked Il\u00e1gin as he approached the whip who had sighted the hare\u2014and not without agitation he looked round and whistled to Erz\u00e1.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Michael Nikan\u00f3rovich?\u201d he said, addressing \u201cUncle.\u201d\n\nThe latter was riding with a sullen expression on his face.\n\n\u201cHow can I join in? Why, you\u2019ve given a village for each of your borzois! That\u2019s it, come on! Yours are worth thousands. Try yours against one another, you two, and I\u2019ll look on!\u201d\n\n\u201cRug\u00e1y, hey, hey!\u201d he shouted. \u201cRug\u00e1yushka!\u201d he added, involuntarily by this diminutive expressing his affection and the hopes he placed on this red borzoi. Nat\u00e1sha saw and felt the agitation the two elderly men and her brother were trying to conceal, and was herself excited by it.\n\nThe huntsman stood halfway up the knoll holding up his whip and the gentlefolk rode up to him at a footpace; the hounds that were far off on the horizon turned away from the hare, and the whips, but not the gentlefolk, also moved away. All were moving slowly and sedately.\n\n\u201cHow is it pointing?\u201d asked Nicholas, riding a hundred paces toward the whip who had sighted the hare.\n\nBut before the whip could reply, the hare, scenting the frost coming next morning, was unable to rest and leaped up. The pack on leash rushed downhill in full cry after the hare, and from all sides the borzois that were not on leash darted after the hounds and the hare. All the hunt, who had been moving slowly, shouted, \u201cStop!\u201d calling in the hounds, while the borzoi whips, with a cry of \u201cA-tu!\u201d galloped across the field setting the borzois on the hare. The tranquil Il\u00e1gin, Nicholas, Nat\u00e1sha, and \u201cUncle\u201d flew, reckless of where and how they went, seeing only the borzois and the hare and fearing only to lose sight even for an instant of the chase. The hare they had started was a strong and swift one. When he jumped up he did not run at once, but pricked his ears listening to the shouting and trampling that resounded from all sides at once. He took a dozen bounds, not very quickly, letting the borzois gain on him, and, finally having chosen his direction and realized his danger, laid back his ears and rushed off headlong. He had been lying in the stubble, but in front of him was the autumn sowing where the ground was soft. The two borzois of the huntsman who had sighted him, having been the nearest, were the first to see and pursue him, but they had not gone far before Il\u00e1gin\u2019s red-spotted Erz\u00e1 passed them, got within a length, flew at the hare with terrible swiftness aiming at his scut, and, thinking she had seized him, rolled over like a ball. The hare arched his back and bounded off yet more swiftly. From behind Erz\u00e1 rushed the broad-haunched, black-spotted M\u00edlka and began rapidly gaining on the hare.\n\n\u201cMil\u00e1shka, dear!\u201d rose Nicholas\u2019 triumphant cry. It looked as if M\u00edlka would immediately pounce on the hare, but she overtook him and flew past. The hare had squatted. Again the beautiful Erz\u00e1 reached him, but when close to the hare\u2019s scut paused as if measuring the distance, so as not to make a mistake this time but seize his hind leg.\n\n\u201cErz\u00e1, darling!\u201d Il\u00e1gin wailed in a voice unlike his own. Erz\u00e1 did not hearken to his appeal. At the very moment when she would have seized her prey, the hare moved and darted along the balk between the winter rye and the stubble. Again Erz\u00e1 and M\u00edlka were abreast, running like a pair of carriage horses, and began to overtake the hare, but it was easier for the hare to run on the balk and the borzois did not overtake him so quickly.\n\n\u201cRug\u00e1y, Rug\u00e1yushka! That\u2019s it, come on!\u201d came a third voice just then, and \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d red borzoi, straining and curving its back, caught up with the two foremost borzois, pushed ahead of them regardless of the terrible strain, put on speed close to the hare, knocked it off the balk onto the ryefield, again put on speed still more viciously, sinking to his knees in the muddy field, and all one could see was how, muddying his back, he rolled over with the hare. A ring of borzois surrounded him. A moment later everyone had drawn up round the crowd of dogs. Only the delighted \u201cUncle\u201d dismounted, and cut off a pad, shaking the hare for the blood to drip off, and anxiously glancing round with restless eyes while his arms and legs twitched. He spoke without himself knowing whom to or what about. \u201cThat\u2019s it, come on! That\u2019s a dog!... There, it has beaten them all, the thousand-ruble as well as the one-ruble borzois. That\u2019s it, come on!\u201d said he, panting and looking wrathfully around as if he were abusing someone, as if they were all his enemies and had insulted him, and only now had he at last succeeded in justifying himself. \u201cThere are your thousand-ruble ones.... That\u2019s it, come on!...\u201d\n\n\u201cRug\u00e1y, here\u2019s a pad for you!\u201d he said, throwing down the hare\u2019s muddy pad. \u201cYou\u2019ve deserved it, that\u2019s it, come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019d tired herself out, she\u2019d run it down three times by herself,\u201d said Nicholas, also not listening to anyone and regardless of whether he were heard or not.\n\n\u201cBut what is there in running across it like that?\u201d said Il\u00e1gin\u2019s groom.\n\n\u201cOnce she had missed it and turned it away, any mongrel could take it,\u201d Il\u00e1gin was saying at the same time, breathless from his gallop and his excitement. At the same moment Nat\u00e1sha, without drawing breath, screamed joyously, ecstatically, and so piercingly that it set everyone\u2019s ear tingling. By that shriek she expressed what the others expressed by all talking at once, and it was so strange that she must herself have been ashamed of so wild a cry and everyone else would have been amazed at it at any other time. \u201cUncle\u201d himself twisted up the hare, threw it neatly and smartly across his horse\u2019s back as if by that gesture he meant to rebuke everybody, and, with an air of not wishing to speak to anyone, mounted his bay and rode off. The others all followed, dispirited and shamefaced, and only much later were they able to regain their former affectation of indifference. For a long time they continued to look at red Rug\u00e1y who, his arched back spattered with mud and clanking the ring of his leash, walked along just behind \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d horse with the serene air of a conqueror.\n\n\u201cWell, I am like any other dog as long as it\u2019s not a question of coursing. But when it is, then look out!\u201d his appearance seemed to Nicholas to be saying.\n\nWhen, much later, \u201cUncle\u201d rode up to Nicholas and began talking to him, he felt flattered that, after what had happened, \u201cUncle\u201d deigned to speak to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nToward evening Il\u00e1gin took leave of Nicholas, who found that they were so far from home that he accepted \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d offer that the hunting party should spend the night in his little village of Mikh\u00e1ylovna.\n\n\u201cAnd if you put up at my house that will be better still. That\u2019s it, come on!\u201d said \u201cUncle.\u201d \u201cYou see it\u2019s damp weather, and you could rest, and the little countess could be driven home in a trap.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d offer was accepted. A huntsman was sent to Otr\u00e1dnoe for a trap, while Nicholas rode with Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya to \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d house.\n\nSome five male domestic serfs, big and little, rushed out to the front porch to meet their master. A score of women serfs, old and young, as well as children, popped out from the back entrance to have a look at the hunters who were arriving. The presence of Nat\u00e1sha\u2014a woman, a lady, and on horseback\u2014raised the curiosity of the serfs to such a degree that many of them came up to her, stared her in the face, and unabashed by her presence made remarks about her as though she were some prodigy on show and not a human being able to hear or understand what was said about her.\n\n\u201cAr\u00ednka! Look, she sits sideways! There she sits and her skirt dangles.... See, she\u2019s got a little hunting horn!\u201d\n\n\u201cGoodness gracious! See her knife?...\u201d\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t she a Tartar!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is it you didn\u2019t go head over heels?\u201d asked the boldest of all, addressing Nat\u00e1sha directly.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d dismounted at the porch of his little wooden house which stood in the midst of an overgrown garden and, after a glance at his retainers, shouted authoritatively that the superfluous ones should take themselves off and that all necessary preparations should be made to receive the guests and the visitors.\n\nThe serfs all dispersed. \u201cUncle\u201d lifted Nat\u00e1sha off her horse and taking her hand led her up the rickety wooden steps of the porch. The house, with its bare, unplastered log walls, was not overclean\u2014it did not seem that those living in it aimed at keeping it spotless\u2014but neither was it noticeably neglected. In the entry there was a smell of fresh apples, and wolf and fox skins hung about.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d led the visitors through the anteroom into a small hall with a folding table and red chairs, then into the drawing room with a round birchwood table and a sofa, and finally into his private room where there was a tattered sofa, a worn carpet, and portraits of Suv\u00f3rov, of the host\u2019s father and mother, and of himself in military uniform. The study smelt strongly of tobacco and dogs. \u201cUncle\u201d asked his visitors to sit down and make themselves at home, and then went out of the room. Rug\u00e1y, his back still muddy, came into the room and lay down on the sofa, cleaning himself with his tongue and teeth. Leading from the study was a passage in which a partition with ragged curtains could be seen. From behind this came women\u2019s laughter and whispers. Nat\u00e1sha, Nicholas, and P\u00e9tya took off their wraps and sat down on the sofa. P\u00e9tya, leaning on his elbow, fell asleep at once. Nat\u00e1sha and Nicholas were silent. Their faces glowed, they were hungry and very cheerful. They looked at one another (now that the hunt was over and they were in the house, Nicholas no longer considered it necessary to show his manly superiority over his sister), Nat\u00e1sha gave him a wink, and neither refrained long from bursting into a peal of ringing laughter even before they had a pretext ready to account for it.\n\nAfter a while \u201cUncle\u201d came in, in a Cossack coat, blue trousers, and small top boots. And Nat\u00e1sha felt that this costume, the very one she had regarded with surprise and amusement at Otr\u00e1dnoe, was just the right thing and not at all worse than a swallow-tail or frock coat. \u201cUncle\u201d too was in high spirits and far from being offended by the brother\u2019s and sister\u2019s laughter (it could never enter his head that they might be laughing at his way of life) he himself joined in the merriment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, young countess, that\u2019s it, come on! I never saw anyone like her!\u201d said he, offering Nicholas a pipe with a long stem and, with a practiced motion of three fingers, taking down another that had been cut short. \u201cShe\u2019s ridden all day like a man, and is as fresh as ever!\u201d\n\nSoon after \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d reappearance the door was opened, evidently from the sound by a barefooted girl, and a stout, rosy, good-looking woman of about forty, with a double chin and full red lips, entered carrying a large loaded tray. With hospitable dignity and cordiality in her glance and in every motion, she looked at the visitors and, with a pleasant smile, bowed respectfully. In spite of her exceptional stoutness, which caused her to protrude her chest and stomach and throw back her head, this woman (who was \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d housekeeper) trod very lightly. She went to the table, set down the tray, and with her plump white hands deftly took from it the bottles and various hors d\u2019oeuvres and dishes and arranged them on the table. When she had finished, she stepped aside and stopped at the door with a smile on her face. \u201cHere I am. I am she! Now do you understand \u2018Uncle\u2019?\u201d her expression said to Rost\u00f3v. How could one help understanding? Not only Nicholas, but even Nat\u00e1sha understood the meaning of his puckered brow and the happy complacent smile that slightly puckered his lips when An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna entered. On the tray was a bottle of herb wine, different kinds of vodka, pickled mushrooms, rye cakes made with buttermilk, honey in the comb, still mead and sparkling mead, apples, nuts (raw and roasted), and nut-and-honey sweets. Afterwards she brought a freshly roasted chicken, ham, preserves made with honey, and preserves made with sugar.\n\nAll this was the fruit of An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna\u2019s housekeeping, gathered and prepared by her. The smell and taste of it all had a smack of An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna herself: a savor of juiciness, cleanliness, whiteness, and pleasant smiles.\n\n\u201cTake this, little Lady-Countess!\u201d she kept saying, as she offered Nat\u00e1sha first one thing and then another.\n\nNat\u00e1sha ate of everything and thought she had never seen or eaten such buttermilk cakes, such aromatic jam, such honey-and-nut sweets, or such a chicken anywhere. An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna left the room.\n\nAfter supper, over their cherry brandy, Rost\u00f3v and \u201cUncle\u201d talked of past and future hunts, of Rug\u00e1y and Il\u00e1gin\u2019s dogs, while Nat\u00e1sha sat upright on the sofa and listened with sparkling eyes. She tried several times to wake P\u00e9tya that he might eat something, but he only muttered incoherent words without waking up. Nat\u00e1sha felt so lighthearted and happy in these novel surroundings that she only feared the trap would come for her too soon. After a casual pause, such as often occurs when receiving friends for the first time in one\u2019s own house, \u201cUncle,\u201d answering a thought that was in his visitors\u2019 minds, said:\n\n\u201cThis, you see, is how I am finishing my days... Death will come. That\u2019s it, come on! Nothing will remain. Then why harm anyone?\u201d\n\n\u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d face was very significant and even handsome as he said this. Involuntarily Rost\u00f3v recalled all the good he had heard about him from his father and the neighbors. Throughout the whole province \u201cUncle\u201d had the reputation of being the most honorable and disinterested of cranks. They called him in to decide family disputes, chose him as executor, confided secrets to him, elected him to be a justice and to other posts; but he always persistently refused public appointments, passing the autumn and spring in the fields on his bay gelding, sitting at home in winter, and lying in his overgrown garden in summer.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you enter the service, Uncle?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did once, but gave it up. I am not fit for it. That\u2019s it, come on! I can\u2019t make head or tail of it. That\u2019s for you\u2014I haven\u2019t brains enough. Now, hunting is another matter\u2014that\u2019s it, come on! Open the door, there!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhy have you shut it?\u201d\n\nThe door at the end of the passage led to the huntsmen\u2019s room, as they called the room for the hunt servants.\n\nThere was a rapid patter of bare feet, and an unseen hand opened the door into the huntsmen\u2019s room, from which came the clear sounds of a balal\u00e1yka on which someone, who was evidently a master of the art, was playing. Nat\u00e1sha had been listening to those strains for some time and now went out into the passage to hear better.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s M\u00edtka, my coachman.... I have got him a good balal\u00e1yka. I\u2019m fond of it,\u201d said \u201cUncle.\u201d\n\nIt was the custom for M\u00edtka to play the balal\u00e1yka in the huntsmen\u2019s room when \u201cUncle\u201d returned from the chase. \u201cUncle\u201d was fond of such music.\n\n\u201cHow good! Really very good!\u201d said Nicholas with some unintentional superciliousness, as if ashamed to confess that the sounds pleased him very much.\n\n\u201cVery good?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha reproachfully, noticing her brother\u2019s tone. \u201cNot \u2018very good\u2019\u2014it\u2019s simply delicious!\u201d\n\nJust as \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d pickled mushrooms, honey, and cherry brandy had seemed to her the best in the world, so also that song, at that moment, seemed to her the acme of musical delight.\n\n\u201cMore, please, more!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha at the door as soon as the balal\u00e1yka ceased. M\u00edtka tuned up afresh, and recommenced thrumming the balal\u00e1yka to the air of My Lady, with trills and variations. \u201cUncle\u201d sat listening, slightly smiling, with his head on one side. The air was repeated a hundred times. The balal\u00e1yka was retuned several times and the same notes were thrummed again, but the listeners did not grow weary of it and wished to hear it again and again. An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna came in and leaned her portly person against the doorpost.\n\n\u201cYou like listening?\u201d she said to Nat\u00e1sha, with a smile extremely like \u201cUncle\u2019s.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a good player of ours,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t play that part right!\u201d said \u201cUncle\u201d suddenly, with an energetic gesture. \u201cHere he ought to burst out\u2014that\u2019s it, come on!\u2014ought to burst out.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you play then?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d did not answer, but smiled.\n\n\u201cAn\u00edsya, go and see if the strings of my guitar are all right. I haven\u2019t touched it for a long time. That\u2019s it\u2014come on! I\u2019ve given it up.\u201d\n\nAn\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna, with her light step, willingly went to fulfill her errand and brought back the guitar.\n\nWithout looking at anyone, \u201cUncle\u201d blew the dust off it and, tapping the case with his bony fingers, tuned the guitar and settled himself in his armchair. He took the guitar a little above the fingerboard, arching his left elbow with a somewhat theatrical gesture, and, with a wink at An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna, struck a single chord, pure and sonorous, and then quietly, smoothly, and confidently began playing in very slow time, not My Lady, but the well-known song: Came a maiden down the street. The tune, played with precision and in exact time, began to thrill in the hearts of Nicholas and Nat\u00e1sha, arousing in them the same kind of sober mirth as radiated from An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna\u2019s whole being. An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna flushed, and drawing her kerchief over her face went laughing out of the room. \u201cUncle\u201d continued to play correctly, carefully, with energetic firmness, looking with a changed and inspired expression at the spot where An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna had just stood. Something seemed to be laughing a little on one side of his face under his gray mustaches, especially as the song grew brisker and the time quicker and when, here and there, as he ran his fingers over the strings, something seemed to snap.\n\n\u201cLovely, lovely! Go on, Uncle, go on!\u201d shouted Nat\u00e1sha as soon as he had finished. She jumped up and hugged and kissed him. \u201cNicholas, Nicholas!\u201d she said, turning to her brother, as if asking him: \u201cWhat is it moves me so?\u201d\n\nNicholas too was greatly pleased by \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d playing, and \u201cUncle\u201d played the piece over again. An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna\u2019s smiling face reappeared in the doorway and behind hers other faces...\n\n\nFetching water clear and sweet,\nStop, dear maiden, I entreat\u2014\n\n\nplayed \u201cUncle\u201d once more, running his fingers skillfully over the strings, and then he stopped short and jerked his shoulders.\n\n\u201cGo on, Uncle dear,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha wailed in an imploring tone as if her life depended on it.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d rose, and it was as if there were two men in him: one of them smiled seriously at the merry fellow, while the merry fellow struck a na\u00efve and precise attitude preparatory to a folk dance.\n\n\u201cNow then, niece!\u201d he exclaimed, waving to Nat\u00e1sha the hand that had just struck a chord.\n\nNat\u00e1sha threw off the shawl from her shoulders, ran forward to face \u201cUncle,\u201d and setting her arms akimbo also made a motion with her shoulders and struck an attitude.\n\nWhere, how, and when had this young countess, educated by an \u00e9migr\u00e9e French governess, imbibed from the Russian air she breathed that spirit and obtained that manner which the pas de ch\u00e2le would, one would have supposed, long ago have effaced? But the spirit and the movements were those inimitable and unteachable Russian ones that \u201cUncle\u201d had expected of her. As soon as she had struck her pose, and smiled triumphantly, proudly, and with sly merriment, the fear that had at first seized Nicholas and the others that she might not do the right thing was at an end, and they were already admiring her.\n\nShe did the right thing with such precision, such complete precision, that An\u00edsya F\u00ebdorovna, who had at once handed her the handkerchief she needed for the dance, had tears in her eyes, though she laughed as she watched this slim, graceful countess, reared in silks and velvets and so different from herself, who yet was able to understand all that was in An\u00edsya and in An\u00edsya\u2019s father and mother and aunt, and in every Russian man and woman.\n\n\u201cWell, little countess; that\u2019s it\u2014come on!\u201d cried \u201cUncle,\u201d with a joyous laugh, having finished the dance. \u201cWell done, niece! Now a fine young fellow must be found as husband for you. That\u2019s it\u2014come on!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s chosen already,\u201d said Nicholas smiling.\n\n\u201cOh?\u201d said \u201cUncle\u201d in surprise, looking inquiringly at Nat\u00e1sha, who nodded her head with a happy smile.\n\n\u201cAnd such a one!\u201d she said. But as soon as she had said it a new train of thoughts and feelings arose in her. \u201cWhat did Nicholas\u2019 smile mean when he said \u2018chosen already\u2019? Is he glad of it or not? It is as if he thought my Bolk\u00f3nski would not approve of or understand our gaiety. But he would understand it all. Where is he now?\u201d she thought, and her face suddenly became serious. But this lasted only a second. \u201cDon\u2019t dare to think about it,\u201d she said to herself, and sat down again smilingly beside \u201cUncle,\u201d begging him to play something more.\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d played another song and a valse; then after a pause he cleared his throat and sang his favorite hunting song:\n\n\nAs \u2018twas growing dark last night\nFell the snow so soft and light...\n\n\n\u201cUncle\u201d sang as peasants sing, with full and na\u00efve conviction that the whole meaning of a song lies in the words and that the tune comes of itself, and that apart from the words there is no tune, which exists only to give measure to the words. As a result of this the unconsidered tune, like the song of a bird, was extraordinarily good. Nat\u00e1sha was in ecstasies over \u201cUncle\u2019s\u201d singing. She resolved to give up learning the harp and to play only the guitar. She asked \u201cUncle\u201d for his guitar and at once found the chords of the song.\n\nAfter nine o\u2019clock two traps and three mounted men, who had been sent to look for them, arrived to fetch Nat\u00e1sha and P\u00e9tya. The count and countess did not know where they were and were very anxious, said one of the men.\n\nP\u00e9tya was carried out like a log and laid in the larger of the two traps. Nat\u00e1sha and Nicholas got into the other. \u201cUncle\u201d wrapped Nat\u00e1sha up warmly and took leave of her with quite a new tenderness. He accompanied them on foot as far as the bridge that could not be crossed, so that they had to go round by the ford, and he sent huntsmen to ride in front with lanterns.\n\n\u201cGood-by, dear niece,\u201d his voice called out of the darkness\u2014not the voice Nat\u00e1sha had known previously, but the one that had sung As \u2018twas growing dark last night.\n\nIn the village through which they passed there were red lights and a cheerful smell of smoke.\n\n\u201cWhat a darling Uncle is!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, when they had come out onto the highroad.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Nicholas. \u201cYou\u2019re not cold?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo. I\u2019m quite, quite all right. I feel so comfortable!\u201d answered Nat\u00e1sha, almost perplexed by her feelings. They remained silent a long while. The night was dark and damp. They could not see the horses, but only heard them splashing through the unseen mud.\n\nWhat was passing in that receptive childlike soul that so eagerly caught and assimilated all the diverse impressions of life? How did they all find place in her? But she was very happy. As they were nearing home she suddenly struck up the air of As \u2018twas growing dark last night\u2014the tune of which she had all the way been trying to get and had at last caught.\n\n\u201cGot it?\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWhat were you thinking about just now, Nicholas?\u201d inquired Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nThey were fond of asking one another that question.\n\n\u201cI?\u201d said Nicholas, trying to remember. \u201cWell, you see, first I thought that Rug\u00e1y, the red hound, was like Uncle, and that if he were a man he would always keep Uncle near him, if not for his riding, then for his manner. What a good fellow Uncle is! Don\u2019t you think so?... Well, and you?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? Wait a bit, wait.... Yes, first I thought that we are driving along and imagining that we are going home, but that heaven knows where we are really going in the darkness, and that we shall arrive and suddenly find that we are not in Otr\u00e1dnoe, but in Fairyland. And then I thought... No, nothing else.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, I expect you thought of him,\u201d said Nicholas, smiling as Nat\u00e1sha knew by the sound of his voice.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, though she had in reality been thinking about Prince Andrew at the same time as of the rest, and of how he would have liked \u201cUncle.\u201d \u201cAnd then I was saying to myself all the way, \u2018How well An\u00edsya carried herself, how well!\u2019\u201d And Nicholas heard her spontaneous, happy, ringing laughter. \u201cAnd do you know,\u201d she suddenly said, \u201cI know that I shall never again be as happy and tranquil as I am now.\u201d\n\n\u201cRubbish, nonsense, humbug!\u201d exclaimed Nicholas, and he thought: \u201cHow charming this Nat\u00e1sha of mine is! I have no other friend like her and never shall have. Why should she marry? We might always drive about together!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a darling this Nicholas of mine is!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cAh, there are still lights in the drawing room!\u201d she said, pointing to the windows of the house that gleamed invitingly in the moist velvety darkness of the night.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nCount Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v had resigned the position of Marshal of the Nobility because it involved him in too much expense, but still his affairs did not improve. Nat\u00e1sha and Nicholas often noticed their parents conferring together anxiously and privately and heard suggestions of selling the fine ancestral Rost\u00f3v house and estate near Moscow. It was not necessary to entertain so freely as when the count had been Marshal, and life at Otr\u00e1dnoe was quieter than in former years, but still the enormous house and its lodges were full of people and more than twenty sat down to table every day. These were all their own people who had settled down in the house almost as members of the family, or persons who were, it seemed, obliged to live in the count\u2019s house. Such were Dimmler the musician and his wife, Vogel the dancing master and his family, Bel\u00f3va, an old maiden lady, an inmate of the house, and many others such as P\u00e9tya\u2019s tutors, the girls\u2019 former governess, and other people who simply found it preferable and more advantageous to live in the count\u2019s house than at home. They had not as many visitors as before, but the old habits of life without which the count and countess could not conceive of existence remained unchanged. There was still the hunting establishment which Nicholas had even enlarged, the same fifty horses and fifteen grooms in the stables, the same expensive presents and dinner parties to the whole district on name days; there were still the count\u2019s games of whist and boston, at which\u2014spreading out his cards so that everybody could see them\u2014he let himself be plundered of hundreds of rubles every day by his neighbors, who looked upon an opportunity to play a rubber with Count Rost\u00f3v as a most profitable source of income.\n\nThe count moved in his affairs as in a huge net, trying not to believe that he was entangled but becoming more and more so at every step, and feeling too feeble to break the meshes or to set to work carefully and patiently to disentangle them. The countess, with her loving heart, felt that her children were being ruined, that it was not the count\u2019s fault for he could not help being what he was\u2014that (though he tried to hide it) he himself suffered from the consciousness of his own and his children\u2019s ruin, and she tried to find means of remedying the position. From her feminine point of view she could see only one solution, namely, for Nicholas to marry a rich heiress. She felt this to be their last hope and that if Nicholas refused the match she had found for him, she would have to abandon the hope of ever getting matters right. This match was with Julie Kar\u00e1gina, the daughter of excellent and virtuous parents, a girl the Rost\u00f3vs had known from childhood, and who had now become a wealthy heiress through the death of the last of her brothers.\n\nThe countess had written direct to Julie\u2019s mother in Moscow suggesting a marriage between their children and had received a favorable answer from her. Kar\u00e1gina had replied that for her part she was agreeable, and everything depend on her daughter\u2019s inclination. She invited Nicholas to come to Moscow.\n\nSeveral times the countess, with tears in her eyes, told her son that now both her daughters were settled, her only wish was to see him married. She said she could lie down in her grave peacefully if that were accomplished. Then she told him that she knew of a splendid girl and tried to discover what he thought about marriage.\n\nAt other times she praised Julie to him and advised him to go to Moscow during the holidays to amuse himself. Nicholas guessed what his mother\u2019s remarks were leading to and during one of these conversations induced her to speak quite frankly. She told him that her only hope of getting their affairs disentangled now lay in his marrying Julie Kar\u00e1gina.\n\n\u201cBut, Mamma, suppose I loved a girl who has no fortune, would you expect me to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for the sake of money?\u201d he asked his mother, not realizing the cruelty of his question and only wishing to show his noble-mindedness.\n\n\u201cNo, you have not understood me,\u201d said his mother, not knowing how to justify herself. \u201cYou have not understood me, Nik\u00f3lenka. It is your happiness I wish for,\u201d she added, feeling that she was telling an untruth and was becoming entangled. She began to cry.\n\n\u201cMamma, don\u2019t cry! Only tell me that you wish it, and you know I will give my life, anything, to put you at ease,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cI would sacrifice anything for you\u2014even my feelings.\u201d\n\nBut the countess did not want the question put like that: she did not want a sacrifice from her son, she herself wished to make a sacrifice for him.\n\n\u201cNo, you have not understood me, don\u2019t let us talk about it,\u201d she replied, wiping away her tears.\n\n\u201cMaybe I do love a poor girl,\u201d said Nicholas to himself. \u201cAm I to sacrifice my feelings and my honor for money? I wonder how Mamma could speak so to me. Because S\u00f3nya is poor I must not love her,\u201d he thought, \u201cmust not respond to her faithful, devoted love? Yet I should certainly be happier with her than with some doll-like Julie. I can always sacrifice my feelings for my family\u2019s welfare,\u201d he said to himself, \u201cbut I can\u2019t coerce my feelings. If I love S\u00f3nya, that feeling is for me stronger and higher than all else.\u201d\n\nNicholas did not go to Moscow, and the countess did not renew the conversation with him about marriage. She saw with sorrow, and sometimes with exasperation, symptoms of a growing attachment between her son and the portionless S\u00f3nya. Though she blamed herself for it, she could not refrain from grumbling at and worrying S\u00f3nya, often pulling her up without reason, addressing her stiffly as \u201cmy dear,\u201d and using the formal \u201cyou\u201d instead of the intimate \u201cthou\u201d in speaking to her. The kindhearted countess was the more vexed with S\u00f3nya because that poor, dark-eyed niece of hers was so meek, so kind, so devotedly grateful to her benefactors, and so faithfully, unchangingly, and unselfishly in love with Nicholas, that there were no grounds for finding fault with her.\n\nNicholas was spending the last of his leave at home. A fourth letter had come from Prince Andrew, from Rome, in which he wrote that he would have been on his way back to Russia long ago had not his wound unexpectedly reopened in the warm climate, which obliged him to defer his return till the beginning of the new year. Nat\u00e1sha was still as much in love with her betrothed, found the same comfort in that love, and was still as ready to throw herself into all the pleasures of life as before; but at the end of the fourth month of their separation she began to have fits of depression which she could not master. She felt sorry for herself: sorry that she was being wasted all this time and of no use to anyone\u2014while she felt herself so capable of loving and being loved.\n\nThings were not cheerful in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nChristmas came and except for the ceremonial Mass, the solemn and wearisome Christmas congratulations from neighbors and servants, and the new dresses everyone put on, there were no special festivities, though the calm frost of twenty degrees R\u00e9aumur, the dazzling sunshine by day, and the starlight of the winter nights seemed to call for some special celebration of the season.\n\nOn the third day of Christmas week, after the midday dinner, all the inmates of the house dispersed to various rooms. It was the dullest time of the day. Nicholas, who had been visiting some neighbors that morning, was asleep on the sitting-room sofa. The old count was resting in his study. S\u00f3nya sat in the drawing room at the round table, copying a design for embroidery. The countess was playing patience. Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna the buffoon sat with a sad face at the window with two old ladies. Nat\u00e1sha came into the room, went up to S\u00f3nya, glanced at what she was doing, and then went up to her mother and stood without speaking.\n\n\u201cWhy are you wandering about like an outcast?\u201d asked her mother. \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cHim... I want him... now, this minute! I want him!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, with glittering eyes and no sign of a smile.\n\nThe countess lifted her head and looked attentively at her daughter.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t look at me, Mamma! Don\u2019t look; I shall cry directly.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down with me a little,\u201d said the countess.\n\n\u201cMamma, I want him. Why should I be wasted like this, Mamma?\u201d\n\nHer voice broke, tears gushed from her eyes, and she turned quickly to hide them and left the room.\n\nShe passed into the sitting room, stood there thinking awhile, and then went into the maids\u2019 room. There an old maidservant was grumbling at a young girl who stood panting, having just run in through the cold from the serfs\u2019 quarters.\n\n\u201cStop playing\u2014there\u2019s a time for everything,\u201d said the old woman.\n\n\u201cLet her alone, Kondr\u00e1tevna,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cGo, Mavr\u00fashka, go.\u201d\n\nHaving released Mavr\u00fashka, Nat\u00e1sha crossed the dancing hall and went to the vestibule. There an old footman and two young ones were playing cards. They broke off and rose as she entered.\n\n\u201cWhat can I do with them?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cOh, Nik\u00edta, please go... where can I send him?... Yes, go to the yard and fetch a fowl, please, a cock, and you, Misha, bring me some oats.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust a few oats?\u201d said Misha, cheerfully and readily.\n\n\u201cGo, go quickly,\u201d the old man urged him.\n\n\u201cAnd you, Theodore, get me a piece of chalk.\u201d\n\nOn her way past the butler\u2019s pantry she told them to set a samovar, though it was not at all the time for tea.\n\nF\u00f3ka, the butler, was the most ill-tempered person in the house. Nat\u00e1sha liked to test her power over him. He distrusted the order and asked whether the samovar was really wanted.\n\n\u201cOh dear, what a young lady!\u201d said F\u00f3ka, pretending to frown at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nNo one in the house sent people about or gave them as much trouble as Nat\u00e1sha did. She could not see people unconcernedly, but had to send them on some errand. She seemed to be trying whether any of them would get angry or sulky with her; but the serfs fulfilled no one\u2019s orders so readily as they did hers. \u201cWhat can I do, where can I go?\u201d thought she, as she went slowly along the passage.\n\n\u201cNast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna, what sort of children shall I have?\u201d she asked the buffoon, who was coming toward her in a woman\u2019s jacket.\n\n\u201cWhy, fleas, crickets, grasshoppers,\u201d answered the buffoon.\n\n\u201cO Lord, O Lord, it\u2019s always the same! Oh, where am I to go? What am I to do with myself?\u201d And tapping with her heels, she ran quickly upstairs to see Vogel and his wife who lived on the upper story.\n\nTwo governesses were sitting with the Vogels at a table, on which were plates of raisins, walnuts, and almonds. The governesses were discussing whether it was cheaper to live in Moscow or Odessa. Nat\u00e1sha sat down, listened to their talk with a serious and thoughtful air, and then got up again.\n\n\u201cThe island of Madagascar,\u201d she said, \u201cMa-da-gas-car,\u201d she repeated, articulating each syllable distinctly, and, not replying to Madame Schoss who asked her what she was saying, she went out of the room.\n\nHer brother P\u00e9tya was upstairs too; with the man in attendance on him he was preparing fireworks to let off that night.\n\n\u201cP\u00e9tya! P\u00e9tya!\u201d she called to him. \u201cCarry me downstairs.\u201d\n\nP\u00e9tya ran up and offered her his back. She jumped on it, putting her arms round his neck, and he pranced along with her.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t... the island of Madagascar!\u201d she said, and jumping off his back she went downstairs.\n\nHaving as it were reviewed her kingdom, tested her power, and made sure that everyone was submissive, but that all the same it was dull, Nat\u00e1sha betook herself to the ballroom, picked up her guitar, sat down in a dark corner behind a bookcase, and began to run her fingers over the strings in the bass, picking out a passage she recalled from an opera she had heard in Petersburg with Prince Andrew. What she drew from the guitar would have had no meaning for other listeners, but in her imagination a whole series of reminiscences arose from those sounds. She sat behind the bookcase with her eyes fixed on a streak of light escaping from the pantry door and listened to herself and pondered. She was in a mood for brooding on the past.\n\nS\u00f3nya passed to the pantry with a glass in her hand. Nat\u00e1sha glanced at her and at the crack in the pantry door, and it seemed to her that she remembered the light falling through that crack once before and S\u00f3nya passing with a glass in her hand. \u201cYes it was exactly the same,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, what is this?\u201d she cried, twanging a thick string.\n\n\u201cOh, you are there!\u201d said S\u00f3nya with a start, and came near and listened. \u201cI don\u2019t know. A storm?\u201d she ventured timidly, afraid of being wrong.\n\n\u201cThere! That\u2019s just how she started and just how she came up smiling timidly when all this happened before,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cand in just the same way I thought there was something lacking in her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s the chorus from The Water-Carrier, listen!\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha sang the air of the chorus so that S\u00f3nya should catch it. \u201cWhere were you going?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cTo change the water in this glass. I am just finishing the design.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou always find something to do, but I can\u2019t,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cAnd where\u2019s Nicholas?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsleep, I think.\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, go and wake him,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cTell him I want him to come and sing.\u201d\n\nShe sat awhile, wondering what the meaning of it all having happened before could be, and without solving this problem, or at all regretting not having done so, she again passed in fancy to the time when she was with him and he was looking at her with a lover\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cOh, if only he would come quicker! I am so afraid it will never be! And, worst of all, I am growing old\u2014that\u2019s the thing! There won\u2019t then be in me what there is now. But perhaps he\u2019ll come today, will come immediately. Perhaps he has come and is sitting in the drawing room. Perhaps he came yesterday and I have forgotten it.\u201d She rose, put down the guitar, and went to the drawing room.\n\nAll the domestic circle, tutors, governesses, and guests, were already at the tea table. The servants stood round the table\u2014but Prince Andrew was not there and life was going on as before.\n\n\u201cAh, here she is!\u201d said the old count, when he saw Nat\u00e1sha enter. \u201cWell, sit down by me.\u201d But Nat\u00e1sha stayed by her mother and glanced round as if looking for something.\n\n\u201cMamma!\u201d she muttered, \u201cgive him to me, give him, Mamma, quickly, quickly!\u201d and she again had difficulty in repressing her sobs.\n\nShe sat down at the table and listened to the conversation between the elders and Nicholas, who had also come to the table. \u201cMy God, my God! The same faces, the same talk, Papa holding his cup and blowing in the same way!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha, feeling with horror a sense of repulsion rising up in her for the whole household, because they were always the same.\n\nAfter tea, Nicholas, S\u00f3nya, and Nat\u00e1sha went to the sitting room, to their favorite corner where their most intimate talks always began.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\n\u201cDoes it ever happen to you,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha to her brother, when they settled down in the sitting room, \u201cdoes it ever happen to you to feel as if there were nothing more to come\u2014nothing; that everything good is past? And to feel not exactly dull, but sad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI should think so!\u201d he replied. \u201cI have felt like that when everything was all right and everyone was cheerful. The thought has come into my mind that I was already tired of it all, and that we must all die. Once in the regiment I had not gone to some merrymaking where there was music... and suddenly I felt so depressed...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I know, I know, I know!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha interrupted him. \u201cWhen I was quite little that used to be so with me. Do you remember when I was punished once about some plums? You were all dancing, and I sat sobbing in the schoolroom? I shall never forget it: I felt sad and sorry for everyone, for myself, and for everyone. And I was innocent\u2014that was the chief thing,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember,\u201d answered Nicholas. \u201cI remember that I came to you afterwards and wanted to comfort you, but do you know, I felt ashamed to. We were terribly absurd. I had a funny doll then and wanted to give it to you. Do you remember?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you remember,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha asked with a pensive smile, \u201chow once, long, long ago, when we were quite little, Uncle called us into the study\u2014that was in the old house\u2014and it was dark\u2014we went in and suddenly there stood...\u201d\n\n\u201cA Negro,\u201d chimed in Nicholas with a smile of delight. \u201cOf course I remember. Even now I don\u2019t know whether there really was a Negro, or if we only dreamed it or were told about him.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was gray, you remember, and had white teeth, and stood and looked at us....\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, do you remember?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I do remember something too,\u201d S\u00f3nya answered timidly.\n\n\u201cYou know I have asked Papa and Mamma about that Negro,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cand they say there was no Negro at all. But you see, you remember!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I do, I remember his teeth as if I had just seen them.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow strange it is! It\u2019s as if it were a dream! I like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you remember how we rolled hard-boiled eggs in the ballroom, and suddenly two old women began spinning round on the carpet? Was that real or not? Do you remember what fun it was?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and you remember how Papa in his blue overcoat fired a gun in the porch?\u201d\n\nSo they went through their memories, smiling with pleasure: not the sad memories of old age, but poetic, youthful ones\u2014those impressions of one\u2019s most distant past in which dreams and realities blend\u2014and they laughed with quiet enjoyment.\n\nS\u00f3nya, as always, did not quite keep pace with them, though they shared the same reminiscences.\n\nMuch that they remembered had slipped from her mind, and what she recalled did not arouse the same poetic feeling as they experienced. She simply enjoyed their pleasure and tried to fit in with it.\n\nShe only really took part when they recalled S\u00f3nya\u2019s first arrival. She told them how afraid she had been of Nicholas because he had on a corded jacket and her nurse had told her that she, too, would be sewn up with cords.\n\n\u201cAnd I remember their telling me that you had been born under a cabbage,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cand I remember that I dared not disbelieve it then, but knew that it was not true, and I felt so uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nWhile they were talking a maid thrust her head in at the other door of the sitting room.\n\n\u201cThey have brought the cock, Miss,\u201d she said in a whisper.\n\n\u201cIt isn\u2019t wanted, P\u00f3lya. Tell them to take it away,\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nIn the middle of their talk in the sitting room, Dimmler came in and went up to the harp that stood there in a corner. He took off its cloth covering, and the harp gave out a jarring sound.\n\n\u201cMr. Dimmler, please play my favorite nocturne by Field,\u201d came the old countess\u2019 voice from the drawing room.\n\nDimmler struck a chord and, turning to Nat\u00e1sha, Nicholas, and S\u00f3nya, remarked: \u201cHow quiet you young people are!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we\u2019re philosophizing,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, glancing round for a moment and then continuing the conversation. They were now discussing dreams.\n\nDimmler began to play; Nat\u00e1sha went on tiptoe noiselessly to the table, took up a candle, carried it out, and returned, seating herself quietly in her former place. It was dark in the room especially where they were sitting on the sofa, but through the big windows the silvery light of the full moon fell on the floor. Dimmler had finished the piece but still sat softly running his fingers over the strings, evidently uncertain whether to stop or to play something else.\n\n\u201cDo you know,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha in a whisper, moving closer to Nicholas and S\u00f3nya, \u201cthat when one goes on and on recalling memories, one at last begins to remember what happened before one was in the world....\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is metempsychosis,\u201d said S\u00f3nya, who had always learned well, and remembered everything. \u201cThe Egyptians believed that our souls have lived in animals, and will go back into animals again.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I don\u2019t believe we ever were in animals,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, still in a whisper though the music had ceased. \u201cBut I am certain that we were angels somewhere there, and have been here, and that is why we remember....\u201d\n\n\u201cMay I join you?\u201d said Dimmler who had come up quietly, and he sat down by them.\n\n\u201cIf we have been angels, why have we fallen lower?\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cNo, that can\u2019t be!\u201d\n\n\u201cNot lower, who said we were lower?... How do I know what I was before?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha rejoined with conviction. \u201cThe soul is immortal\u2014well then, if I shall always live I must have lived before, lived for a whole eternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but it is hard for us to imagine eternity,\u201d remarked Dimmler, who had joined the young folk with a mildly condescending smile but now spoke as quietly and seriously as they.\n\n\u201cWhy is it hard to imagine eternity?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cIt is now today, and it will be tomorrow, and always; and there was yesterday, and the day before....\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha! Now it\u2019s your turn. Sing me something,\u201d they heard the countess say. \u201cWhy are you sitting there like conspirators?\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma, I don\u2019t at all want to,\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha, but all the same she rose.\n\nNone of them, not even the middle-aged Dimmler, wanted to break off their conversation and quit that corner in the sitting room, but Nat\u00e1sha got up and Nicholas sat down at the clavichord. Standing as usual in the middle of the hall and choosing the place where the resonance was best, Nat\u00e1sha began to sing her mother\u2019s favorite song.\n\nShe had said she did not want to sing, but it was long since she had sung, and long before she again sang, as she did that evening. The count, from his study where he was talking to M\u00edtenka, heard her and, like a schoolboy in a hurry to run out to play, blundered in his talk while giving orders to the steward, and at last stopped, while M\u00edtenka stood in front of him also listening and smiling. Nicholas did not take his eyes off his sister and drew breath in time with her. S\u00f3nya, as she listened, thought of the immense difference there was between herself and her friend, and how impossible it was for her to be anything like as bewitching as her cousin. The old countess sat with a blissful yet sad smile and with tears in her eyes, occasionally shaking her head. She thought of Nat\u00e1sha and of her own youth, and of how there was something unnatural and dreadful in this impending marriage of Nat\u00e1sha and Prince Andrew.\n\nDimmler, who had seated himself beside the countess, listened with closed eyes.\n\n\u201cAh, Countess,\u201d he said at last, \u201cthat\u2019s a European talent, she has nothing to learn\u2014what softness, tenderness, and strength....\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, how afraid I am for her, how afraid I am!\u201d said the countess, not realizing to whom she was speaking. Her maternal instinct told her that Nat\u00e1sha had too much of something, and that because of this she would not be happy. Before Nat\u00e1sha had finished singing, fourteen-year-old P\u00e9tya rushed in delightedly, to say that some mummers had arrived.\n\nNat\u00e1sha stopped abruptly.\n\n\u201cIdiot!\u201d she screamed at her brother and, running to a chair, threw herself on it, sobbing so violently that she could not stop for a long time.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nothing, Mamma, really it\u2019s nothing; only P\u00e9tya startled me,\u201d she said, trying to smile, but her tears still flowed and sobs still choked her.\n\nThe mummers (some of the house serfs) dressed up as bears, Turks, innkeepers, and ladies\u2014frightening and funny\u2014bringing in with them the cold from outside and a feeling of gaiety, crowded, at first timidly, into the anteroom, then hiding behind one another they pushed into the ballroom where, shyly at first and then more and more merrily and heartily, they started singing, dancing, and playing Christmas games. The countess, when she had identified them and laughed at their costumes, went into the drawing room. The count sat in the ballroom, smiling radiantly and applauding the players. The young people had disappeared.\n\nHalf an hour later there appeared among the other mummers in the ballroom an old lady in a hooped skirt\u2014this was Nicholas. A Turkish girl was P\u00e9tya. A clown was Dimmler. An hussar was Nat\u00e1sha, and a Circassian was S\u00f3nya with burnt-cork mustache and eyebrows.\n\nAfter the condescending surprise, nonrecognition, and praise, from those who were not themselves dressed up, the young people decided that their costumes were so good that they ought to be shown elsewhere.\n\nNicholas, who, as the roads were in splendid condition, wanted to take them all for a drive in his troyka, proposed to take with them about a dozen of the serf mummers and drive to \u201cUncle\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, why disturb the old fellow?\u201d said the countess. \u201cBesides, you wouldn\u2019t have room to turn round there. If you must go, go to the Melyuk\u00f3vs\u2019.\u201d\n\nMelyuk\u00f3va was a widow, who, with her family and their tutors and governesses, lived three miles from the Rost\u00f3vs.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, my dear,\u201d chimed in the old count, thoroughly aroused. \u201cI\u2019ll dress up at once and go with them. I\u2019ll make Pashette open her eyes.\u201d\n\nBut the countess would not agree to his going; he had had a bad leg all these last days. It was decided that the count must not go, but that if Louisa Iv\u00e1novna (Madame Schoss) would go with them, the young ladies might go to the Melyuk\u00f3vs\u2019, S\u00f3nya, generally so timid and shy, more urgently than anyone begging Louisa Iv\u00e1novna not to refuse.\n\nS\u00f3nya\u2019s costume was the best of all. Her mustache and eyebrows were extraordinarily becoming. Everyone told her she looked very handsome, and she was in a spirited and energetic mood unusual with her. Some inner voice told her that now or never her fate would be decided, and in her male attire she seemed quite a different person. Louisa Iv\u00e1novna consented to go, and in half an hour four troyka sleighs with large and small bells, their runners squeaking and whistling over the frozen snow, drove up to the porch.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was foremost in setting a merry holiday tone, which, passing from one to another, grew stronger and reached its climax when they all came out into the frost and got into the sleighs, talking, calling to one another, laughing, and shouting.\n\nTwo of the troykas were the usual household sleighs, the third was the old count\u2019s with a trotter from the Orl\u00f3v stud as shaft horse, the fourth was Nicholas\u2019 own with a short shaggy black shaft horse. Nicholas, in his old lady\u2019s dress over which he had belted his hussar overcoat, stood in the middle of the sleigh, reins in hand.\n\nIt was so light that he could see the moonlight reflected from the metal harness disks and from the eyes of the horses, who looked round in alarm at the noisy party under the shadow of the porch roof.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, S\u00f3nya, Madame Schoss, and two maids got into Nicholas\u2019 sleigh; Dimmler, his wife, and P\u00e9tya, into the old count\u2019s, and the rest of the mummers seated themselves in the other two sleighs.\n\n\u201cYou go ahead, Zakh\u00e1r!\u201d shouted Nicholas to his father\u2019s coachman, wishing for a chance to race past him.\n\nThe old count\u2019s troyka, with Dimmler and his party, started forward, squeaking on its runners as though freezing to the snow, its deep-toned bell clanging. The side horses, pressing against the shafts of the middle horse, sank in the snow, which was dry and glittered like sugar, and threw it up.\n\nNicholas set off, following the first sleigh; behind him the others moved noisily, their runners squeaking. At first they drove at a steady trot along the narrow road. While they drove past the garden the shadows of the bare trees often fell across the road and hid the brilliant moonlight, but as soon as they were past the fence, the snowy plain bathed in moonlight and motionless spread out before them glittering like diamonds and dappled with bluish shadows. Bang, bang! went the first sleigh over a cradle hole in the snow of the road, and each of the other sleighs jolted in the same way, and rudely breaking the frost-bound stillness, the troykas began to speed along the road, one after the other.\n\n\u201cA hare\u2019s track, a lot of tracks!\u201d rang out Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice through the frost-bound air.\n\n\u201cHow light it is, Nicholas!\u201d came S\u00f3nya\u2019s voice.\n\nNicholas glanced round at S\u00f3nya, and bent down to see her face closer. Quite a new, sweet face with black eyebrows and mustaches peeped up at him from her sable furs\u2014so close and yet so distant\u2014in the moonlight.\n\n\u201cThat used to be S\u00f3nya,\u201d thought he, and looked at her closer and smiled.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Nicholas?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d said he and turned again to the horses.\n\nWhen they came out onto the beaten highroad\u2014polished by sleigh runners and cut up by rough-shod hoofs, the marks of which were visible in the moonlight\u2014the horses began to tug at the reins of their own accord and increased their pace. The near side horse, arching his head and breaking into a short canter, tugged at his traces. The shaft horse swayed from side to side, moving his ears as if asking: \u201cIsn\u2019t it time to begin now?\u201d In front, already far ahead the deep bell of the sleigh ringing farther and farther off, the black horses driven by Zakh\u00e1r could be clearly seen against the white snow. From that sleigh one could hear the shouts, laughter, and voices of the mummers.\n\n\u201cGee up, my darlings!\u201d shouted Nicholas, pulling the reins to one side and flourishing the whip.\n\nIt was only by the keener wind that met them and the jerks given by the side horses who pulled harder\u2014ever increasing their gallop\u2014that one noticed how fast the troyka was flying. Nicholas looked back. With screams, squeals, and waving of whips that caused even the shaft horses to gallop\u2014the other sleighs followed. The shaft horse swung steadily beneath the bow over its head, with no thought of slackening pace and ready to put on speed when required.\n\nNicholas overtook the first sleigh. They were driving downhill and coming out upon a broad trodden track across a meadow, near a river.\n\n\u201cWhere are we?\u201d thought he. \u201cIt\u2019s the Kos\u00f3y meadow, I suppose. But no\u2014this is something new I\u2019ve never seen before. This isn\u2019t the Kos\u00f3y meadow nor the D\u00ebmkin hill, and heaven only knows what it is! It is something new and enchanted. Well, whatever it may be...\u201d And shouting to his horses, he began to pass the first sleigh.\n\nZakh\u00e1r held back his horses and turned his face, which was already covered with hoarfrost to his eyebrows.\n\nNicholas gave the horses the rein, and Zakh\u00e1r, stretching out his arms, clucked his tongue and let his horses go.\n\n\u201cNow, look out, master!\u201d he cried.\n\nFaster still the two troykas flew side by side, and faster moved the feet of the galloping side horses. Nicholas began to draw ahead. Zakh\u00e1r, while still keeping his arms extended, raised one hand with the reins.\n\n\u201cNo you won\u2019t, master!\u201d he shouted.\n\nNicholas put all his horses to a gallop and passed Zakh\u00e1r. The horses showered the fine dry snow on the faces of those in the sleigh\u2014beside them sounded quick ringing bells and they caught confused glimpses of swiftly moving legs and the shadows of the troyka they were passing. The whistling sound of the runners on the snow and the voices of girls shrieking were heard from different sides.\n\nAgain checking his horses, Nicholas looked around him. They were still surrounded by the magic plain bathed in moonlight and spangled with stars.\n\n\u201cZakh\u00e1r is shouting that I should turn to the left, but why to the left?\u201d thought Nicholas. \u201cAre we getting to the Melyuk\u00f3vs\u2019? Is this Melyuk\u00f3vka? Heaven only knows where we are going, and heaven knows what is happening to us\u2014but it is very strange and pleasant whatever it is.\u201d And he looked round in the sleigh.\n\n\u201cLook, his mustache and eyelashes are all white!\u201d said one of the strange, pretty, unfamiliar people\u2014the one with fine eyebrows and mustache.\n\n\u201cI think this used to be Nat\u00e1sha,\u201d thought Nicholas, \u201cand that was Madame Schoss, but perhaps it\u2019s not, and this Circassian with the mustache I don\u2019t know, but I love her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAren\u2019t you cold?\u201d he asked.\n\nThey did not answer but began to laugh. Dimmler from the sleigh behind shouted something\u2014probably something funny\u2014but they could not make out what he said.\n\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d some voices answered, laughing.\n\n\u201cBut here was a fairy forest with black moving shadows, and a glitter of diamonds and a flight of marble steps and the silver roofs of fairy buildings and the shrill yells of some animals. And if this is really Melyuk\u00f3vka, it is still stranger that we drove heaven knows where and have come to Melyuk\u00f3vka,\u201d thought Nicholas.\n\nIt really was Melyuk\u00f3vka, and maids and footmen with merry faces came running, out to the porch carrying candles.\n\n\u201cWho is it?\u201d asked someone in the porch.\n\n\u201cThe mummers from the count\u2019s. I know by the horses,\u201d replied some voices.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna Melyuk\u00f3va, a broadly built, energetic woman wearing spectacles, sat in the drawing room in a loose dress, surrounded by her daughters whom she was trying to keep from feeling dull. They were quietly dropping melted wax into snow and looking at the shadows the wax figures would throw on the wall, when they heard the steps and voices of new arrivals in the vestibule.\n\nHussars, ladies, witches, clowns, and bears, after clearing their throats and wiping the hoarfrost from their faces in the vestibule, came into the ballroom where candles were hurriedly lighted. The clown\u2014Dimmler\u2014and the lady\u2014Nicholas\u2014started a dance. Surrounded by the screaming children the mummers, covering their faces and disguising their voices, bowed to their hostess and arranged themselves about the room.\n\n\u201cDear me! there\u2019s no recognizing them! And Nat\u00e1sha! See whom she looks like! She really reminds me of somebody. But Herr Dimmler\u2014isn\u2019t he good! I didn\u2019t know him! And how he dances. Dear me, there\u2019s a Circassian. Really, how becoming it is to dear S\u00f3nya. And who is that? Well, you have cheered us up! Nik\u00edta and Vanya\u2014clear away the tables! And we were sitting so quietly. Ha, ha, ha!... The hussar, the hussar! Just like a boy! And the legs!... I can\u2019t look at him...\u201d different voices were saying.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, the young Melyuk\u00f3vs\u2019 favorite, disappeared with them into the back rooms where a cork and various dressing gowns and male garments were called for and received from the footman by bare girlish arms from behind the door. Ten minutes later, all the young Melyuk\u00f3vs joined the mummers.\n\nPelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna, having given orders to clear the rooms for the visitors and arranged about refreshments for the gentry and the serfs, went about among the mummers without removing her spectacles, peering into their faces with a suppressed smile and failing to recognize any of them. It was not merely Dimmler and the Rost\u00f3vs she failed to recognize, she did not even recognize her own daughters, or her late husband\u2019s, dressing gowns and uniforms, which they had put on.\n\n\u201cAnd who is this?\u201d she asked her governess, peering into the face of her own daughter dressed up as a Kaz\u00e1n-Tartar. \u201cI suppose it is one of the Rost\u00f3vs! Well, Mr. Hussar, and what regiment do you serve in?\u201d she asked Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cHere, hand some fruit jelly to the Turk!\u201d she ordered the butler who was handing things round. \u201cThat\u2019s not forbidden by his law.\u201d\n\nSometimes, as she looked at the strange but amusing capers cut by the dancers, who\u2014having decided once for all that being disguised, no one would recognize them\u2014were not at all shy, Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna hid her face in her handkerchief, and her whole stout body shook with irrepressible, kindly, elderly laughter.\n\n\u201cMy little S\u00e1sha! Look at S\u00e1sha!\u201d she said.\n\nAfter Russian country dances and chorus dances, Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna made the serfs and gentry join in one large circle: a ring, a string, and a silver ruble were fetched and they all played games together.\n\nIn an hour, all the costumes were crumpled and disordered. The corked eyebrows and mustaches were smeared over the perspiring, flushed, and merry faces. Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna began to recognize the mummers, admired their cleverly contrived costumes, and particularly how they suited the young ladies, and she thanked them all for having entertained her so well. The visitors were invited to supper in the drawing room, and the serfs had something served to them in the ballroom.\n\n\u201cNow to tell one\u2019s fortune in the empty bathhouse is frightening!\u201d said an old maid who lived with the Melyuk\u00f3vs, during supper.\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d said the eldest Melyuk\u00f3v girl.\n\n\u201cYou wouldn\u2019t go, it takes courage....\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cTell what happened to the young lady!\u201d said the second Melyuk\u00f3v girl.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d began the old maid, \u201ca young lady once went out, took a cock, laid the table for two, all properly, and sat down. After sitting a while, she suddenly hears someone coming... a sleigh drives up with harness bells; she hears him coming! He comes in, just in the shape of a man, like an officer\u2014comes in and sits down to table with her.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh! ah!\u201d screamed Nat\u00e1sha, rolling her eyes with horror.\n\n\u201cYes? And how... did he speak?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, like a man. Everything quite all right, and he began persuading her; and she should have kept him talking till cockcrow, but she got frightened, just got frightened and hid her face in her hands. Then he caught her up. It was lucky the maids ran in just then....\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, why frighten them?\u201d said Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna.\n\n\u201cMamma, you used to try your fate yourself...\u201d said her daughter.\n\n\u201cAnd how does one do it in a barn?\u201d inquired S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cWell, say you went to the barn now, and listened. It depends on what you hear; hammering and knocking\u2014that\u2019s bad; but a sound of shifting grain is good and one sometimes hears that, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma, tell us what happened to you in the barn.\u201d\n\nPelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna smiled.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ve forgotten...\u201d she replied. \u201cBut none of you would go?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I will; Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna, let me! I\u2019ll go,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cWell, why not, if you\u2019re not afraid?\u201d\n\n\u201cLouisa Iv\u00e1novna, may I?\u201d asked S\u00f3nya.\n\nWhether they were playing the ring and string game or the ruble game or talking as now, Nicholas did not leave S\u00f3nya\u2019s side, and gazed at her with quite new eyes. It seemed to him that it was only today, thanks to that burnt-cork mustache, that he had fully learned to know her. And really, that evening, S\u00f3nya was brighter, more animated, and prettier than Nicholas had ever seen her before.\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s what she is like; what a fool I have been!\u201d he thought gazing at her sparkling eyes, and under the mustache a happy rapturous smile dimpled her cheeks, a smile he had never seen before.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not afraid of anything,\u201d said S\u00f3nya. \u201cMay I go at once?\u201d She got up.\n\nThey told her where the barn was and how she should stand and listen, and they handed her a fur cloak. She threw this over her head and shoulders and glanced at Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWhat a darling that girl is!\u201d thought he. \u201cAnd what have I been thinking of till now?\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya went out into the passage to go to the barn. Nicholas went hastily to the front porch, saying he felt too hot. The crowd of people really had made the house stuffy.\n\nOutside, there was the same cold stillness and the same moon, but even brighter than before. The light was so strong and the snow sparkled with so many stars that one did not wish to look up at the sky and the real stars were unnoticed. The sky was black and dreary, while the earth was gay.\n\n\u201cI am a fool, a fool! what have I been waiting for?\u201d thought Nicholas, and running out from the porch he went round the corner of the house and along the path that led to the back porch. He knew S\u00f3nya would pass that way. Halfway lay some snow-covered piles of firewood and across and along them a network of shadows from the bare old lime trees fell on the snow and on the path. This path led to the barn. The log walls of the barn and its snow-covered roof, that looked as if hewn out of some precious stone, sparkled in the moonlight. A tree in the garden snapped with the frost, and then all was again perfectly silent. His bosom seemed to inhale not air but the strength of eternal youth and gladness.\n\nFrom the back porch came the sound of feet descending the steps, the bottom step upon which snow had fallen gave a ringing creak and he heard the voice of an old maidservant saying, \u201cStraight, straight, along the path, Miss. Only, don\u2019t look back.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am not afraid,\u201d answered S\u00f3nya\u2019s voice, and along the path toward Nicholas came the crunching, whistling sound of S\u00f3nya\u2019s feet in her thin shoes.\n\nS\u00f3nya came along, wrapped in her cloak. She was only a couple of paces away when she saw him, and to her too he was not the Nicholas she had known and always slightly feared. He was in a woman\u2019s dress, with tousled hair and a happy smile new to S\u00f3nya. She ran rapidly toward him.\n\n\u201cQuite different and yet the same,\u201d thought Nicholas, looking at her face all lit up by the moonlight. He slipped his arms under the cloak that covered her head, embraced her, pressed her to him, and kissed her on the lips that wore a mustache and had a smell of burnt cork. S\u00f3nya kissed him full on the lips, and disengaging her little hands pressed them to his cheeks.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya!... Nicholas!\u201d... was all they said. They ran to the barn and then back again, re-entering, he by the front and she by the back porch.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nWhen they all drove back from Pelag\u00e9ya Dan\u00edlovna\u2019s, Nat\u00e1sha, who always saw and noticed everything, arranged that she and Madame Schoss should go back in the sleigh with Dimmler, and S\u00f3nya with Nicholas and the maids.\n\nOn the way back Nicholas drove at a steady pace instead of racing and kept peering by that fantastic all-transforming light into S\u00f3nya\u2019s face and searching beneath the eyebrows and mustache for his former and his present S\u00f3nya from whom he had resolved never to be parted again. He looked and recognizing in her both the old and the new S\u00f3nya, and being reminded by the smell of burnt cork of the sensation of her kiss, inhaled the frosty air with a full breast and, looking at the ground flying beneath him and at the sparkling sky, felt himself again in fairyland.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, is it well with thee?\u201d he asked from time to time.\n\n\u201cYes!\u201d she replied. \u201cAnd with thee?\u201d\n\nWhen halfway home Nicholas handed the reins to the coachman and ran for a moment to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s sleigh and stood on its wing.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha!\u201d he whispered in French, \u201cdo you know I have made up my mind about S\u00f3nya?\u201d\n\n\u201cHave you told her?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, suddenly beaming all over with joy.\n\n\u201cOh, how strange you are with that mustache and those eyebrows!... Nat\u00e1sha\u2014are you glad?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so glad, so glad! I was beginning to be vexed with you. I did not tell you, but you have been treating her badly. What a heart she has, Nicholas! I am horrid sometimes, but I was ashamed to be happy while S\u00f3nya was not,\u201d continued Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cNow I am so glad! Well, run back to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, wait a bit.... Oh, how funny you look!\u201d cried Nicholas, peering into her face and finding in his sister too something new, unusual, and bewitchingly tender that he had not seen in her before. \u201cNat\u00e1sha, it\u2019s magical, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she replied. \u201cYou have done splendidly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHad I seen her before as she is now,\u201d thought Nicholas, \u201cI should long ago have asked her what to do and have done whatever she told me, and all would have been well.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you are glad and I have done right?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, quite right! I had a quarrel with Mamma some time ago about it. Mamma said she was angling for you. How could she say such a thing! I nearly stormed at Mamma. I will never let anyone say anything bad of S\u00f3nya, for there is nothing but good in her.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it\u2019s all right?\u201d said Nicholas, again scrutinizing the expression of his sister\u2019s face to see if she was in earnest. Then he jumped down and, his boots scrunching the snow, ran back to his sleigh. The same happy, smiling Circassian, with mustache and beaming eyes looking up from under a sable hood, was still sitting there, and that Circassian was S\u00f3nya, and that S\u00f3nya was certainly his future happy and loving wife.\n\nWhen they reached home and had told their mother how they had spent the evening at the Melyuk\u00f3vs\u2019, the girls went to their bedroom. When they had undressed, but without washing off the cork mustaches, they sat a long time talking of their happiness. They talked of how they would live when they were married, how their husbands would be friends, and how happy they would be. On Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s table stood two looking glasses which Duny\u00e1sha had prepared beforehand.\n\n\u201cOnly when will all that be? I am afraid never.... It would be too good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, rising and going to the looking glasses.\n\n\u201cSit down, Nat\u00e1sha; perhaps you\u2019ll see him,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\nNat\u00e1sha lit the candles, one on each side of one of the looking glasses, and sat down.\n\n\u201cI see someone with a mustache,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, seeing her own face.\n\n\u201cYou mustn\u2019t laugh, Miss,\u201d said Duny\u00e1sha.\n\nWith S\u00f3nya\u2019s help and the maid\u2019s, Nat\u00e1sha got the glass she held into the right position opposite the other; her face assumed a serious expression and she sat silent. She sat a long time looking at the receding line of candles reflected in the glasses and expecting (from tales she had heard) to see a coffin, or him, Prince Andrew, in that last dim, indistinctly outlined square. But ready as she was to take the smallest speck for the image of a man or of a coffin, she saw nothing. She began blinking rapidly and moved away from the looking glasses.\n\n\u201cWhy is it others see things and I don\u2019t?\u201d she said. \u201cYou sit down now, S\u00f3nya. You absolutely must, tonight! Do it for me.... Today I feel so frightened!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya sat down before the glasses, got the right position, and began looking.\n\n\u201cNow, Miss S\u00f3nya is sure to see something,\u201d whispered Duny\u00e1sha; \u201cwhile you do nothing but laugh.\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya heard this and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s whisper:\n\n\u201cI know she will. She saw something last year.\u201d\n\nFor about three minutes all were silent.\n\n\u201cOf course she will!\u201d whispered Nat\u00e1sha, but did not finish... suddenly S\u00f3nya pushed away the glass she was holding and covered her eyes with her hand.\n\n\u201cOh, Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cDid you see? Did you? What was it?\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha, holding up the looking glass.\n\nS\u00f3nya had not seen anything, she was just wanting to blink and to get up when she heard Nat\u00e1sha say, \u201cOf course she will!\u201d She did not wish to disappoint either Duny\u00e1sha or Nat\u00e1sha, but it was hard to sit still. She did not herself know how or why the exclamation escaped her when she covered her eyes.\n\n\u201cYou saw him?\u201d urged Nat\u00e1sha, seizing her hand.\n\n\u201cYes. Wait a bit... I... saw him,\u201d S\u00f3nya could not help saying, not yet knowing whom Nat\u00e1sha meant by him, Nicholas or Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cBut why shouldn\u2019t I say I saw something? Others do see! Besides who can tell whether I saw anything or not?\u201d flashed through S\u00f3nya\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cYes, I saw him,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cHow? Standing or lying?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I saw... At first there was nothing, then I saw him lying down.\u201d\n\n\u201cAndrew lying? Is he ill?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, her frightened eyes fixed on her friend.\n\n\u201cNo, on the contrary, on the contrary! His face was cheerful, and he turned to me.\u201d And when saying this she herself fancied she had really seen what she described.\n\n\u201cWell, and then, S\u00f3nya?...\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter that, I could not make out what there was; something blue and red....\u201d\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya! When will he come back? When shall I see him! O, God, how afraid I am for him and for myself and about everything!...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began, and without replying to S\u00f3nya\u2019s words of comfort she got into bed, and long after her candle was out lay open-eyed and motionless, gazing at the moonlight through the frosty windowpanes.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nSoon after the Christmas holidays Nicholas told his mother of his love for S\u00f3nya and of his firm resolve to marry her. The countess, who had long noticed what was going on between them and was expecting this declaration, listened to him in silence and then told her son that he might marry whom he pleased, but that neither she nor his father would give their blessing to such a marriage. Nicholas, for the first time, felt that his mother was displeased with him and that, despite her love for him, she would not give way. Coldly, without looking at her son, she sent for her husband and, when he came, tried briefly and coldly to inform him of the facts, in her son\u2019s presence, but unable to restrain herself she burst into tears of vexation and left the room. The old count began irresolutely to admonish Nicholas and beg him to abandon his purpose. Nicholas replied that he could not go back on his word, and his father, sighing and evidently disconcerted, very soon became silent and went in to the countess. In all his encounters with his son, the count was always conscious of his own guilt toward him for having wasted the family fortune, and so he could not be angry with him for refusing to marry an heiress and choosing the dowerless S\u00f3nya. On this occasion, he was only more vividly conscious of the fact that if his affairs had not been in disorder, no better wife for Nicholas than S\u00f3nya could have been wished for, and that no one but himself with his M\u00edtenka and his uncomfortable habits was to blame for the condition of the family finances.\n\nThe father and mother did not speak of the matter to their son again, but a few days later the countess sent for S\u00f3nya and, with a cruelty neither of them expected, reproached her niece for trying to catch Nicholas and for ingratitude. S\u00f3nya listened silently with downcast eyes to the countess\u2019 cruel words, without understanding what was required of her. She was ready to sacrifice everything for her benefactors. Self-sacrifice was her most cherished idea but in this case she could not see what she ought to sacrifice, or for whom. She could not help loving the countess and the whole Rost\u00f3v family, but neither could she help loving Nicholas and knowing that his happiness depended on that love. She was silent and sad and did not reply. Nicholas felt the situation to be intolerable and went to have an explanation with his mother. He first implored her to forgive him and S\u00f3nya and consent to their marriage, then he threatened that if she molested S\u00f3nya he would at once marry her secretly.\n\nThe countess, with a coldness her son had never seen in her before, replied that he was of age, that Prince Andrew was marrying without his father\u2019s consent, and he could do the same, but that she would never receive that intriguer as her daughter.\n\nExploding at the word intriguer, Nicholas, raising his voice, told his mother he had never expected her to try to force him to sell his feelings, but if that were so, he would say for the last time.... But he had no time to utter the decisive word which the expression of his face caused his mother to await with terror, and which would perhaps have forever remained a cruel memory to them both. He had not time to say it, for Nat\u00e1sha, with a pale and set face, entered the room from the door at which she had been listening.\n\n\u201cNicholas, you are talking nonsense! Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, I tell you!...\u201d she almost screamed, so as to drown his voice.\n\n\u201cMamma darling, it\u2019s not at all so... my poor, sweet darling,\u201d she said to her mother, who conscious that they had been on the brink of a rupture gazed at her son with terror, but in the obstinacy and excitement of the conflict could not and would not give way.\n\n\u201cNicholas, I\u2019ll explain to you. Go away! Listen, Mamma darling,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nHer words were incoherent, but they attained the purpose at which she was aiming.\n\nThe countess, sobbing heavily, hid her face on her daughter\u2019s breast, while Nicholas rose, clutching his head, and left the room.\n\nNat\u00e1sha set to work to effect a reconciliation, and so far succeeded that Nicholas received a promise from his mother that S\u00f3nya should not be troubled, while he on his side promised not to undertake anything without his parents\u2019 knowledge.\n\nFirmly resolved, after putting his affairs in order in the regiment, to retire from the army and return and marry S\u00f3nya, Nicholas, serious, sorrowful, and at variance with his parents, but, as it seemed to him, passionately in love, left at the beginning of January to rejoin his regiment.\n\nAfter Nicholas had gone things in the Rost\u00f3v household were more depressing than ever, and the countess fell ill from mental agitation.\n\nS\u00f3nya was unhappy at the separation from Nicholas and still more so on account of the hostile tone the countess could not help adopting toward her. The count was more perturbed than ever by the condition of his affairs, which called for some decisive action. Their town house and estate near Moscow had inevitably to be sold, and for this they had to go to Moscow. But the countess\u2019 health obliged them to delay their departure from day to day.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, who had borne the first period of separation from her betrothed lightly and even cheerfully, now grew more agitated and impatient every day. The thought that her best days, which she would have employed in loving him, were being vainly wasted, with no advantage to anyone, tormented her incessantly. His letters for the most part irritated her. It hurt her to think that while she lived only in the thought of him, he was living a real life, seeing new places and new people that interested him. The more interesting his letters were the more vexed she felt. Her letters to him, far from giving her any comfort, seemed to her a wearisome and artificial obligation. She could not write, because she could not conceive the possibility of expressing sincerely in a letter even a thousandth part of what she expressed by voice, smile, and glance. She wrote to him formal, monotonous, and dry letters, to which she attached no importance herself, and in the rough copies of which the countess corrected her mistakes in spelling.\n\nThere was still no improvement in the countess\u2019 health, but it was impossible to defer the journey to Moscow any longer. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s trousseau had to be ordered and the house sold. Moreover, Prince Andrew was expected in Moscow, where old Prince Bolk\u00f3nski was spending the winter, and Nat\u00e1sha felt sure he had already arrived.\n\nSo the countess remained in the country, and the count, taking S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha with him, went to Moscow at the end of January.\n\n\n\nBOOK EIGHT: 1811 - 12\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAfter Prince Andrew\u2019s engagement to Nat\u00e1sha, Pierre without any apparent cause suddenly felt it impossible to go on living as before. Firmly convinced as he was of the truths revealed to him by his benefactor, and happy as he had been in perfecting his inner man, to which he had devoted himself with such ardor\u2014all the zest of such a life vanished after the engagement of Andrew and Nat\u00e1sha and the death of Joseph Alex\u00e9evich, the news of which reached him almost at the same time. Only the skeleton of life remained: his house, a brilliant wife who now enjoyed the favors of a very important personage, acquaintance with all Petersburg, and his court service with its dull formalities. And this life suddenly seemed to Pierre unexpectedly loathsome. He ceased keeping a diary, avoided the company of the Brothers, began going to the club again, drank a great deal, and came once more in touch with the bachelor sets, leading such a life that the Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne thought it necessary to speak severely to him about it. Pierre felt that she was right, and to avoid compromising her went away to Moscow.\n\nIn Moscow as soon as he entered his huge house in which the faded and fading princesses still lived, with its enormous retinue; as soon as, driving through the town, he saw the Iberian shrine with innumerable tapers burning before the golden covers of the icons, the Kr\u00e9mlin Square with its snow undisturbed by vehicles, the sleigh drivers and hovels of the S\u00edvtsev Vrazh\u00f3k, those old Moscovites who desired nothing, hurried nowhere, and were ending their days leisurely; when he saw those old Moscow ladies, the Moscow balls, and the English Club, he felt himself at home in a quiet haven. In Moscow he felt at peace, at home, warm and dirty as in an old dressing gown.\n\nMoscow society, from the old women down to the children, received Pierre like a long-expected guest whose place was always ready awaiting him. For Moscow society Pierre was the nicest, kindest, most intellectual, merriest, and most magnanimous of cranks, a heedless, genial nobleman of the old Russian type. His purse was always empty because it was open to everyone.\n\nBenefit performances, poor pictures, statues, benevolent societies, gypsy choirs, schools, subscription dinners, sprees, Freemasons, churches, and books\u2014no one and nothing met with a refusal from him, and had it not been for two friends who had borrowed large sums from him and taken him under their protection, he would have given everything away. There was never a dinner or soiree at the club without him. As soon as he sank into his place on the sofa after two bottles of Margaux he was surrounded, and talking, disputing, and joking began. When there were quarrels, his kindly smile and well-timed jests reconciled the antagonists. The Masonic dinners were dull and dreary when he was not there.\n\nWhen after a bachelor supper he rose with his amiable and kindly smile, yielding to the entreaties of the festive company to drive off somewhere with them, shouts of delight and triumph arose among the young men. At balls he danced if a partner was needed. Young ladies, married and unmarried, liked him because without making love to any of them, he was equally amiable to all, especially after supper. \u201cIl est charmant; il n\u2019a pas de sexe,\u201d they said of him.\n\nPierre was one of those retired gentlemen-in-waiting of whom there were hundreds good-humoredly ending their days in Moscow.\n\nHow horrified he would have been seven years before, when he first arrived from abroad, had he been told that there was no need for him to seek or plan anything, that his rut had long been shaped, eternally predetermined, and that wriggle as he might, he would be what all in his position were. He could not have believed it! Had he not at one time longed with all his heart to establish a republic in Russia; then himself to be a Napoleon; then to be a philosopher; and then a strategist and the conqueror of Napoleon? Had he not seen the possibility of, and passionately desired, the regeneration of the sinful human race, and his own progress to the highest degree of perfection? Had he not established schools and hospitals and liberated his serfs?\n\nBut instead of all that\u2014here he was, the wealthy husband of an unfaithful wife, a retired gentleman-in-waiting, fond of eating and drinking and, as he unbuttoned his waistcoat, of abusing the government a bit, a member of the Moscow English Club, and a universal favorite in Moscow society. For a long time he could not reconcile himself to the idea that he was one of those same retired Moscow gentlemen-in-waiting he had so despised seven years before.\n\nSometimes he consoled himself with the thought that he was only living this life temporarily; but then he was shocked by the thought of how many, like himself, had entered that life and that club temporarily, with all their teeth and hair, and had only left it when not a single tooth or hair remained.\n\nIn moments of pride, when he thought of his position it seemed to him that he was quite different and distinct from those other retired gentlemen-in-waiting he had formerly despised: they were empty, stupid, contented fellows, satisfied with their position, \u201cwhile I am still discontented and want to do something for mankind. But perhaps all these comrades of mine struggled just like me and sought something new, a path in life of their own, and like me were brought by force of circumstances, society, and race\u2014by that elemental force against which man is powerless\u2014to the condition I am in,\u201d said he to himself in moments of humility; and after living some time in Moscow he no longer despised, but began to grow fond of, to respect, and to pity his comrades in destiny, as he pitied himself.\n\nPierre no longer suffered moments of despair, hypochondria, and disgust with life, but the malady that had formerly found expression in such acute attacks was driven inwards and never left him for a moment. \u201cWhat for? Why? What is going on in the world?\u201d he would ask himself in perplexity several times a day, involuntarily beginning to reflect anew on the meaning of the phenomena of life; but knowing by experience that there were no answers to these questions he made haste to turn away from them, and took up a book, or hurried off to the club or to Apoll\u00f3n Nikol\u00e1evich\u2019s, to exchange the gossip of the town.\n\n\u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who has never cared for anything but her own body and is one of the stupidest women in the world,\u201d thought Pierre, \u201cis regarded by people as the acme of intelligence and refinement, and they pay homage to her. Napoleon Bonaparte was despised by all as long as he was great, but now that he has become a wretched comedian the Emperor Francis wants to offer him his daughter in an illegal marriage. The Spaniards, through the Catholic clergy, offer praise to God for their victory over the French on the fourteenth of June, and the French, also through the Catholic clergy, offer praise because on that same fourteenth of June they defeated the Spaniards. My brother Masons swear by the blood that they are ready to sacrifice everything for their neighbor, but they do not give a ruble each to the collections for the poor, and they intrigue, the Astraea Lodge against the Manna Seekers, and fuss about an authentic Scotch carpet and a charter that nobody needs, and the meaning of which the very man who wrote it does not understand. We all profess the Christian law of forgiveness of injuries and love of our neighbors, the law in honor of which we have built in Moscow forty times forty churches\u2014but yesterday a deserter was knouted to death and a minister of that same law of love and forgiveness, a priest, gave the soldier a cross to kiss before his execution.\u201d So thought Pierre, and the whole of this general deception which everyone accepts, accustomed as he was to it, astonished him each time as if it were something new. \u201cI understand the deception and confusion,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut how am I to tell them all that I see? I have tried, and have always found that they too in the depths of their souls understand it as I do, and only try not to see it. So it appears that it must be so! But I\u2014what is to become of me?\u201d thought he. He had the unfortunate capacity many men, especially Russians, have of seeing and believing in the possibility of goodness and truth, but of seeing the evil and falsehood of life too clearly to be able to take a serious part in it. Every sphere of work was connected, in his eyes, with evil and deception. Whatever he tried to be, whatever he engaged in, the evil and falsehood of it repulsed him and blocked every path of activity. Yet he had to live and to find occupation. It was too dreadful to be under the burden of", "sequence": 13}, {"offset": 1400000, "text": " these insoluble problems, so he abandoned himself to any distraction in order to forget them. He frequented every kind of society, drank much, bought pictures, engaged in building, and above all\u2014read.\n\nHe read, and read everything that came to hand. On coming home, while his valets were still taking off his things, he picked up a book and began to read. From reading he passed to sleeping, from sleeping to gossip in drawing rooms of the club, from gossip to carousals and women; from carousals back to gossip, reading, and wine. Drinking became more and more a physical and also a moral necessity. Though the doctors warned him that with his corpulence wine was dangerous for him, he drank a great deal. He was only quite at ease when having poured several glasses of wine mechanically into his large mouth he felt a pleasant warmth in his body, an amiability toward all his fellows, and a readiness to respond superficially to every idea without probing it deeply. Only after emptying a bottle or two did he feel dimly that the terribly tangled skein of life which previously had terrified him was not as dreadful as he had thought. He was always conscious of some aspect of that skein, as with a buzzing in his head after dinner or supper he chatted or listened to conversation or read. But under the influence of wine he said to himself: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. I\u2019ll get it unraveled. I have a solution ready, but have no time now\u2014I\u2019ll think it all out later on!\u201d But the later on never came.\n\nIn the morning, on an empty stomach, all the old questions appeared as insoluble and terrible as ever, and Pierre hastily picked up a book, and if anyone came to see him he was glad.\n\nSometimes he remembered how he had heard that soldiers in war when entrenched under the enemy\u2019s fire, if they have nothing to do, try hard to find some occupation the more easily to bear the danger. To Pierre all men seemed like those soldiers, seeking refuge from life: some in ambition, some in cards, some in framing laws, some in women, some in toys, some in horses, some in politics, some in sport, some in wine, and some in governmental affairs. \u201cNothing is trivial, and nothing is important, it\u2019s all the same\u2014only to save oneself from it as best one can,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cOnly not to see it, that dreadful it!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAt the beginning of winter Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski and his daughter moved to Moscow. At that time enthusiasm for the Emperor Alexander\u2019s regime had weakened and a patriotic and anti-French tendency prevailed there, and this, together with his past and his intellect and his originality, at once made Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski an object of particular respect to the Moscovites and the center of the Moscow opposition to the government.\n\nThe prince had aged very much that year. He showed marked signs of senility by a tendency to fall asleep, forgetfulness of quite recent events, remembrance of remote ones, and the childish vanity with which he accepted the role of head of the Moscow opposition. In spite of this the old man inspired in all his visitors alike a feeling of respectful veneration\u2014especially of an evening when he came in to tea in his old-fashioned coat and powdered wig and, aroused by anyone, told his abrupt stories of the past, or uttered yet more abrupt and scathing criticisms of the present. For them all, that old-fashioned house with its gigantic mirrors, pre-Revolution furniture, powdered footmen, and the stern shrewd old man (himself a relic of the past century) with his gentle daughter and the pretty Frenchwoman who were reverently devoted to him presented a majestic and agreeable spectacle. But the visitors did not reflect that besides the couple of hours during which they saw their host, there were also twenty-two hours in the day during which the private and intimate life of the house continued.\n\nLatterly that private life had become very trying for Princess Mary. There in Moscow she was deprived of her greatest pleasures\u2014talks with the pilgrims and the solitude which refreshed her at Bald Hills\u2014and she had none of the advantages and pleasures of city life. She did not go out into society; everyone knew that her father would not let her go anywhere without him, and his failing health prevented his going out himself, so that she was not invited to dinners and evening parties. She had quite abandoned the hope of getting married. She saw the coldness and malevolence with which the old prince received and dismissed the young men, possible suitors, who sometimes appeared at their house. She had no friends: during this visit to Moscow she had been disappointed in the two who had been nearest to her. Mademoiselle Bourienne, with whom she had never been able to be quite frank, had now become unpleasant to her, and for various reasons Princess Mary avoided her. Julie, with whom she had corresponded for the last five years, was in Moscow, but proved to be quite alien to her when they met. Just then Julie, who by the death of her brothers had become one of the richest heiresses in Moscow, was in the full whirl of society pleasures. She was surrounded by young men who, she fancied, had suddenly learned to appreciate her worth. Julie was at that stage in the life of a society woman when she feels that her last chance of marrying has come and that her fate must be decided now or never. On Thursdays Princess Mary remembered with a mournful smile that she now had no one to write to, since Julie\u2014whose presence gave her no pleasure was here and they met every week. Like the old \u00e9migr\u00e9 who declined to marry the lady with whom he had spent his evenings for years, she regretted Julie\u2019s presence and having no one to write to. In Moscow Princess Mary had no one to talk to, no one to whom to confide her sorrow, and much sorrow fell to her lot just then. The time for Prince Andrew\u2019s return and marriage was approaching, but his request to her to prepare his father for it had not been carried out; in fact, it seemed as if matters were quite hopeless, for at every mention of the young Countess Rost\u00f3va the old prince (who apart from that was usually in a bad temper) lost control of himself. Another lately added sorrow arose from the lessons she gave her six year-old nephew. To her consternation she detected in herself in relation to little Nicholas some symptoms of her father\u2019s irritability. However often she told herself that she must not get irritable when teaching her nephew, almost every time that, pointer in hand, she sat down to show him the French alphabet, she so longed to pour her own knowledge quickly and easily into the child\u2014who was already afraid that Auntie might at any moment get angry\u2014that at his slightest inattention she trembled, became flustered and heated, raised her voice, and sometimes pulled him by the arm and put him in the corner. Having put him in the corner she would herself begin to cry over her cruel, evil nature, and little Nicholas, following her example, would sob, and without permission would leave his corner, come to her, pull her wet hands from her face, and comfort her. But what distressed the princess most of all was her father\u2019s irritability, which was always directed against her and had of late amounted to cruelty. Had he forced her to prostrate herself to the ground all night, had he beaten her or made her fetch wood or water, it would never have entered her mind to think her position hard; but this loving despot\u2014the more cruel because he loved her and for that reason tormented himself and her\u2014knew how not merely to hurt and humiliate her deliberately, but to show her that she was always to blame for everything. Of late he had exhibited a new trait that tormented Princess Mary more than anything else; this was his ever-increasing intimacy with Mademoiselle Bourienne. The idea that at the first moment of receiving the news of his son\u2019s intentions had occurred to him in jest\u2014that if Andrew got married he himself would marry Bourienne\u2014had evidently pleased him, and latterly he had persistently, and as it seemed to Princess Mary merely to offend her, shown special endearments to the companion and expressed his dissatisfaction with his daughter by demonstrations of love of Bourienne.\n\nOne day in Moscow in Princess Mary\u2019s presence (she thought her father did it purposely when she was there) the old prince kissed Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s hand and, drawing her to him, embraced her affectionately. Princess Mary flushed and ran out of the room. A few minutes later Mademoiselle Bourienne came into Princess Mary\u2019s room smiling and making cheerful remarks in her agreeable voice. Princess Mary hastily wiped away her tears, went resolutely up to Mademoiselle Bourienne, and evidently unconscious of what she was doing began shouting in angry haste at the Frenchwoman, her voice breaking: \u201cIt\u2019s horrible, vile, inhuman, to take advantage of the weakness...\u201d She did not finish. \u201cLeave my room,\u201d she exclaimed, and burst into sobs.\n\nNext day the prince did not say a word to his daughter, but she noticed that at dinner he gave orders that Mademoiselle Bourienne should be served first. After dinner, when the footman handed coffee and from habit began with the princess, the prince suddenly grew furious, threw his stick at Philip, and instantly gave instructions to have him conscripted for the army.\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t obey... I said it twice... and he doesn\u2019t obey! She is the first person in this house; she\u2019s my best friend,\u201d cried the prince. \u201cAnd if you allow yourself,\u201d he screamed in a fury, addressing Princess Mary for the first time, \u201cto forget yourself again before her as you dared to do yesterday, I will show you who is master in this house. Go! Don\u2019t let me set eyes on you; beg her pardon!\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary asked Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s pardon, and also her father\u2019s pardon for herself and for Philip the footman, who had begged for her intervention.\n\nAt such moments something like a pride of sacrifice gathered in her soul. And suddenly that father whom she had judged would look for his spectacles in her presence, fumbling near them and not seeing them, or would forget something that had just occurred, or take a false step with his failing legs and turn to see if anyone had noticed his feebleness, or, worst of all, at dinner when there were no visitors to excite him would suddenly fall asleep, letting his napkin drop and his shaking head sink over his plate. \u201cHe is old and feeble, and I dare to condemn him!\u201d she thought at such moments, with a feeling of revulsion against herself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nIn 1811 there was living in Moscow a French doctor\u2014M\u00e9tivier\u2014who had rapidly become the fashion. He was enormously tall, handsome, amiable as Frenchmen are, and was, as all Moscow said, an extraordinarily clever doctor. He was received in the best houses not merely as a doctor, but as an equal.\n\nPrince Nicholas had always ridiculed medicine, but latterly on Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s advice had allowed this doctor to visit him and had grown accustomed to him. M\u00e9tivier came to see the prince about twice a week.\n\nOn December 6\u2014St. Nicholas\u2019 Day and the prince\u2019s name day\u2014all Moscow came to the prince\u2019s front door but he gave orders to admit no one and to invite to dinner only a small number, a list of whom he gave to Princess Mary.\n\nM\u00e9tivier, who came in the morning with his felicitations, considered it proper in his quality of doctor de forcer la consigne, as he told Princess Mary, and went in to see the prince. It happened that on that morning of his name day the prince was in one of his worst moods. He had been going about the house all the morning finding fault with everyone and pretending not to understand what was said to him and not to be understood himself. Princess Mary well knew this mood of quiet absorbed querulousness, which generally culminated in a burst of rage, and she went about all that morning as though facing a cocked and loaded gun and awaited the inevitable explosion. Until the doctor\u2019s arrival the morning had passed off safely. After admitting the doctor, Princess Mary sat down with a book in the drawing room near the door through which she could hear all that passed in the study.\n\nAt first she heard only M\u00e9tivier\u2019s voice, then her father\u2019s, then both voices began speaking at the same time, the door was flung open, and on the threshold appeared the handsome figure of the terrified M\u00e9tivier with his shock of black hair, and the prince in his dressing gown and fez, his face distorted with fury and the pupils of his eyes rolled downwards.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand?\u201d shouted the prince, \u201cbut I do! French spy, slave of Buonaparte, spy, get out of my house! Be off, I tell you...\u201d and he slammed the door.\n\nM\u00e9tivier, shrugging his shoulders, went up to Mademoiselle Bourienne who at the sound of shouting had run in from an adjoining room.\n\n\u201cThe prince is not very well: bile and rush of blood to the head. Keep calm, I will call again tomorrow,\u201d said M\u00e9tivier; and putting his fingers to his lips he hastened away.\n\nThrough the study door came the sound of slippered feet and the cry: \u201cSpies, traitors, traitors everywhere! Not a moment\u2019s peace in my own house!\u201d\n\nAfter M\u00e9tivier\u2019s departure the old prince called his daughter in, and the whole weight of his wrath fell on her. She was to blame that a spy had been admitted. Had he not told her, yes, told her to make a list, and not to admit anyone who was not on that list? Then why was that scoundrel admitted? She was the cause of it all. With her, he said, he could not have a moment\u2019s peace and could not die quietly.\n\n\u201cNo, ma\u2019am! We must part, we must part! Understand that, understand it! I cannot endure any more,\u201d he said, and left the room. Then, as if afraid she might find some means of consolation, he returned and trying to appear calm added: \u201cAnd don\u2019t imagine I have said this in a moment of anger. I am calm. I have thought it over, and it will be carried out\u2014we must part; so find some place for yourself....\u201d But he could not restrain himself and with the virulence of which only one who loves is capable, evidently suffering himself, he shook his fists at her and screamed:\n\n\u201cIf only some fool would marry her!\u201d Then he slammed the door, sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne, and subsided into his study.\n\nAt two o\u2019clock the six chosen guests assembled for dinner.\n\nThese guests\u2014the famous Count Rostopch\u00edn, Prince Lopukh\u00edn with his nephew, General Chatr\u00f3v an old war comrade of the prince\u2019s, and of the younger generation Pierre and Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y\u2014awaited the prince in the drawing room.\n\nBor\u00eds, who had come to Moscow on leave a few days before, had been anxious to be presented to Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski, and had contrived to ingratiate himself so well that the old prince in his case made an exception to the rule of not receiving bachelors in his house.\n\nThe prince\u2019s house did not belong to what is known as fashionable society, but his little circle\u2014though not much talked about in town\u2014was one it was more flattering to be received in than any other. Bor\u00eds had realized this the week before when the commander in chief in his presence invited Rostopch\u00edn to dinner on St. Nicholas\u2019 Day, and Rostopch\u00edn had replied that he could not come:\n\n\u201cOn that day I always go to pay my devotions to the relics of Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, yes!\u201d replied the commander in chief. \u201cHow is he?...\u201d\n\nThe small group that assembled before dinner in the lofty old-fashioned drawing room with its old furniture resembled the solemn gathering of a court of justice. All were silent or talked in low tones. Prince Nicholas came in serious and taciturn. Princess Mary seemed even quieter and more diffident than usual. The guests were reluctant to address her, feeling that she was in no mood for their conversation. Count Rostopch\u00edn alone kept the conversation going, now relating the latest town news, and now the latest political gossip.\n\nLopukh\u00edn and the old general occasionally took part in the conversation. Prince Bolk\u00f3nski listened as a presiding judge receives a report, only now and then, silently or by a brief word, showing that he took heed of what was being reported to him. The tone of the conversation was such as indicated that no one approved of what was being done in the political world. Incidents were related evidently confirming the opinion that everything was going from bad to worse, but whether telling a story or giving an opinion the speaker always stopped, or was stopped, at the point beyond which his criticism might touch the sovereign himself.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the latest political news: Napoleon\u2019s seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg\u2019s territory, and the Russian Note, hostile to Napoleon, which had been sent to all the European courts.\n\n\u201cBonaparte treats Europe as a pirate does a captured vessel,\u201d said Count Rostopch\u00edn, repeating a phrase he had uttered several times before. \u201cOne only wonders at the long-suffering or blindness of the crowned heads. Now the Pope\u2019s turn has come and Bonaparte doesn\u2019t scruple to depose the head of the Catholic Church\u2014yet all keep silent! Our sovereign alone has protested against the seizure of the Duke of Oldenburg\u2019s territory, and even...\u201d Count Rostopch\u00edn paused, feeling that he had reached the limit beyond which censure was impossible.\n\n\u201cOther territories have been offered in exchange for the Duchy of Oldenburg,\u201d said Prince Bolk\u00f3nski. \u201cHe shifts the Dukes about as I might move my serfs from Bald Hills to Boguch\u00e1rovo or my Ryaz\u00e1n estates.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Duke of Oldenburg bears his misfortunes with admirable strength of character and resignation,\u201d remarked Bor\u00eds, joining in respectfully.\n\nHe said this because on his journey from Petersburg he had had the honor of being presented to the Duke. Prince Bolk\u00f3nski glanced at the young man as if about to say something in reply, but changed his mind, evidently considering him too young.\n\n\u201cI have read our protests about the Oldenburg affair and was surprised how badly the Note was worded,\u201d remarked Count Rostopch\u00edn in the casual tone of a man dealing with a subject quite familiar to him.\n\nPierre looked at Rostopch\u00edn with na\u00efve astonishment, not understanding why he should be disturbed by the bad composition of the Note.\n\n\u201cDoes it matter, Count, how the Note is worded,\u201d he asked, \u201cso long as its substance is forcible?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy dear fellow, with our five hundred thousand troops it should be easy to have a good style,\u201d returned Count Rostopch\u00edn.\n\nPierre now understood the count\u2019s dissatisfaction with the wording of the Note.\n\n\u201cOne would have thought quill drivers enough had sprung up,\u201d remarked the old prince. \u201cThere in Petersburg they are always writing\u2014not notes only but even new laws. My Andrew there has written a whole volume of laws for Russia. Nowadays they are always writing!\u201d and he laughed unnaturally.\n\nThere was a momentary pause in the conversation; the old general cleared his throat to draw attention.\n\n\u201cDid you hear of the last event at the review in Petersburg? The figure cut by the new French ambassador.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? Yes, I heard something: he said something awkward in His Majesty\u2019s presence.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis Majesty drew attention to the Grenadier division and to the march past,\u201d continued the general, \u201cand it seems the ambassador took no notice and allowed himself to reply that: \u2018We in France pay no attention to such trifles!\u2019 The Emperor did not condescend to reply. At the next review, they say, the Emperor did not once deign to address him.\u201d\n\nAll were silent. On this fact relating to the Emperor personally, it was impossible to pass any judgment.\n\n\u201cImpudent fellows!\u201d said the prince. \u201cYou know M\u00e9tivier? I turned him out of my house this morning. He was here; they admitted him in spite of my request that they should let no one in,\u201d he went on, glancing angrily at his daughter.\n\nAnd he narrated his whole conversation with the French doctor and the reasons that convinced him that M\u00e9tivier was a spy. Though these reasons were very insufficient and obscure, no one made any rejoinder.\n\nAfter the roast, champagne was served. The guests rose to congratulate the old prince. Princess Mary, too, went round to him.\n\nHe gave her a cold, angry look and offered her his wrinkled, clean-shaven cheek to kiss. The whole expression of his face told her that he had not forgotten the morning\u2019s talk, that his decision remained in force, and only the presence of visitors hindered his speaking of it to her now.\n\nWhen they went into the drawing room where coffee was served, the old men sat together.\n\nPrince Nicholas grew more animated and expressed his views on the impending war.\n\nHe said that our wars with Bonaparte would be disastrous so long as we sought alliances with the Germans and thrust ourselves into European affairs, into which we had been drawn by the Peace of Tilsit. \u201cWe ought not to fight either for or against Austria. Our political interests are all in the East, and in regard to Bonaparte the only thing is to have an armed frontier and a firm policy, and he will never dare to cross the Russian frontier, as was the case in 1807!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can we fight the French, Prince?\u201d said Count Rostopch\u00edn. \u201cCan we arm ourselves against our teachers and divinities? Look at our youths, look at our ladies! The French are our Gods: Paris is our Kingdom of Heaven.\u201d\n\nHe began speaking louder, evidently to be heard by everyone.\n\n\u201cFrench dresses, French ideas, French feelings! There now, you turned M\u00e9tivier out by the scruff of his neck because he is a Frenchman and a scoundrel, but our ladies crawl after him on their knees. I went to a party last night, and there out of five ladies three were Roman Catholics and had the Pope\u2019s indulgence for doing woolwork on Sundays. And they themselves sit there nearly naked, like the signboards at our Public Baths if I may say so. Ah, when one looks at our young people, Prince, one would like to take Peter the Great\u2019s old cudgel out of the museum and belabor them in the Russian way till all the nonsense jumps out of them.\u201d\n\nAll were silent. The old prince looked at Rostopch\u00edn with a smile and wagged his head approvingly.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by, your excellency, keep well!\u201d said Rostopch\u00edn, getting up with characteristic briskness and holding out his hand to the prince.\n\n\u201cGood-by, my dear fellow.... His words are music, I never tire of hearing him!\u201d said the old prince, keeping hold of the hand and offering his cheek to be kissed.\n\nFollowing Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s example the others also rose.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nPrincess Mary as she sat listening to the old men\u2019s talk and faultfinding, understood nothing of what she heard; she only wondered whether the guests had all observed her father\u2019s hostile attitude toward her. She did not even notice the special attentions and amiabilities shown her during dinner by Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, who was visiting them for the third time already.\n\nPrincess Mary turned with absent-minded questioning look to Pierre, who hat in hand and with a smile on his face was the last of the guests to approach her after the old prince had gone out and they were left alone in the drawing room.\n\n\u201cMay I stay a little longer?\u201d he said, letting his stout body sink into an armchair beside her.\n\n\u201cOh yes,\u201d she answered. \u201cYou noticed nothing?\u201d her look asked.\n\nPierre was in an agreeable after-dinner mood. He looked straight before him and smiled quietly.\n\n\u201cHave you known that young man long, Princess?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWho?\u201d\n\n\u201cDrubetsk\u00f3y.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, not long....\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you like him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he is an agreeable young man.... Why do you ask me that?\u201d said Princess Mary, still thinking of that morning\u2019s conversation with her father.\n\n\u201cBecause I have noticed that when a young man comes on leave from Petersburg to Moscow it is usually with the object of marrying an heiress.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have observed that?\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Pierre with a smile, \u201cand this young man now manages matters so that where there is a wealthy heiress there he is too. I can read him like a book. At present he is hesitating whom to lay siege to\u2014you or Mademoiselle Julie Kar\u00e1gina. He is very attentive to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe visits them?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, very often. And do you know the new way of courting?\u201d said Pierre with an amused smile, evidently in that cheerful mood of good humored raillery for which he so often reproached himself in his diary.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d replied Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cTo please Moscow girls nowadays one has to be melancholy. He is very melancholy with Mademoiselle Kar\u00e1gina,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d asked Princess Mary, looking into Pierre\u2019s kindly face and still thinking of her own sorrow. \u201cIt would be a relief,\u201d thought she, \u201cif I ventured to confide what I am feeling to someone. I should like to tell everything to Pierre. He is kind and generous. It would be a relief. He would give me advice.\u201d\n\n\u201cWould you marry him?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, my God, Count, there are moments when I would marry anybody!\u201d she cried suddenly to her own surprise and with tears in her voice. \u201cAh, how bitter it is to love someone near to you and to feel that...\u201d she went on in a trembling voice, \u201cthat you can do nothing for him but grieve him, and to know that you cannot alter this. Then there is only one thing left\u2014to go away, but where could I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is wrong? What is it, Princess?\u201d\n\nBut without finishing what she was saying, Princess Mary burst into tears.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what is the matter with me today. Don\u2019t take any notice\u2014forget what I have said!\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s gaiety vanished completely. He anxiously questioned the princess, asked her to speak out fully and confide her grief to him; but she only repeated that she begged him to forget what she had said, that she did not remember what she had said, and that she had no trouble except the one he knew of\u2014that Prince Andrew\u2019s marriage threatened to cause a rupture between father and son.\n\n\u201cHave you any news of the Rost\u00f3vs?\u201d she asked, to change the subject. \u201cI was told they are coming soon. I am also expecting Andrew any day. I should like them to meet here.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how does he now regard the matter?\u201d asked Pierre, referring to the old prince.\n\nPrincess Mary shook her head.\n\n\u201cWhat is to be done? In a few months the year will be up. The thing is impossible. I only wish I could spare my brother the first moments. I wish they would come sooner. I hope to be friends with her. You have known them a long time,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cTell me honestly the whole truth: what sort of girl is she, and what do you think of her?\u2014The real truth, because you know Andrew is risking so much doing this against his father\u2019s will that I should like to know....\u201d\n\nAn undefined instinct told Pierre that these explanations, and repeated requests to be told the whole truth, expressed ill-will on the princess\u2019 part toward her future sister-in-law and a wish that he should disapprove of Andrew\u2019s choice; but in reply he said what he felt rather than what he thought.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how to answer your question,\u201d he said, blushing without knowing why. \u201cI really don\u2019t know what sort of girl she is; I can\u2019t analyze her at all. She is enchanting, but what makes her so I don\u2019t know. That is all one can say about her.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary sighed, and the expression on her face said: \u201cYes, that\u2019s what I expected and feared.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs she clever?\u201d she asked.\n\nPierre considered.\n\n\u201cI think not,\u201d he said, \u201cand yet\u2014yes. She does not deign to be clever.... Oh no, she is simply enchanting, and that is all.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary again shook her head disapprovingly.\n\n\u201cAh, I so long to like her! Tell her so if you see her before I do.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear they are expected very soon,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nPrincess Mary told Pierre of her plan to become intimate with her future sister-in-law as soon as the Rost\u00f3vs arrived and to try to accustom the old prince to her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nBor\u00eds had not succeeded in making a wealthy match in Petersburg, so with the same object in view he came to Moscow. There he wavered between the two richest heiresses, Julie and Princess Mary. Though Princess Mary despite her plainness seemed to him more attractive than Julie, he, without knowing why, felt awkward about paying court to her. When they had last met on the old prince\u2019s name day, she had answered at random all his attempts to talk sentimentally, evidently not listening to what he was saying.\n\nJulie on the contrary accepted his attentions readily, though in a manner peculiar to herself.\n\nShe was twenty-seven. After the death of her brothers she had become very wealthy. She was by now decidedly plain, but thought herself not merely as good-looking as before but even far more attractive. She was confirmed in this delusion by the fact that she had become a very wealthy heiress and also by the fact that the older she grew the less dangerous she became to men, and the more freely they could associate with her and avail themselves of her suppers, soirees, and the animated company that assembled at her house, without incurring any obligation. A man who would have been afraid ten years before of going every day to the house when there was a girl of seventeen there, for fear of compromising her and committing himself, would now go boldly every day and treat her not as a marriageable girl but as a sexless acquaintance.\n\nThat winter the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019 house was the most agreeable and hospitable in Moscow. In addition to the formal evening and dinner parties, a large company, chiefly of men, gathered there every day, supping at midnight and staying till three in the morning. Julie never missed a ball, a promenade, or a play. Her dresses were always of the latest fashion. But in spite of that she seemed to be disillusioned about everything and told everyone that she did not believe either in friendship or in love, or any of the joys of life, and expected peace only \u201cyonder.\u201d She adopted the tone of one who has suffered a great disappointment, like a girl who has either lost the man she loved or been cruelly deceived by him. Though nothing of the kind had happened to her she was regarded in that light, and had even herself come to believe that she had suffered much in life. This melancholy, which did not prevent her amusing herself, did not hinder the young people who came to her house from passing the time pleasantly. Every visitor who came to the house paid his tribute to the melancholy mood of the hostess, and then amused himself with society gossip, dancing, intellectual games, and bouts rim\u00e9s, which were in vogue at the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019. Only a few of these young men, among them Bor\u00eds, entered more deeply into Julie\u2019s melancholy, and with these she had prolonged conversations in private on the vanity of all worldly things, and to them she showed her albums filled with mournful sketches, maxims, and verses.\n\nTo Bor\u00eds, Julie was particularly gracious: she regretted his early disillusionment with life, offered him such consolation of friendship as she who had herself suffered so much could render, and showed him her album. Bor\u00eds sketched two trees in the album and wrote: \u201cRustic trees, your dark branches shed gloom and melancholy upon me.\u201d\n\nOn another page he drew a tomb, and wrote:\n\n\nLa mort est secourable et la mort est tranquille.\nAh! contre les douleurs il n\u2019y a pas d\u2019autre asile.\n\n\nJulie said this was charming\n\n\u201cThere is something so enchanting in the smile of melancholy,\u201d she said to Bor\u00eds, repeating word for word a passage she had copied from a book. \u201cIt is a ray of light in the darkness, a shade between sadness and despair, showing the possibility of consolation.\u201d\n\nIn reply Bor\u00eds wrote these lines:\n\n\nAliment de poison d\u2019une \u00e2me trop sensible,\nToi, sans qui le bonheur me serait impossible,\nTendre m\u00e9lancholie, ah, viens me consoler,\nViens calmer les tourments de ma sombre retraite,\nEt m\u00eale une douceur secr\u00e8te\nA ces pleurs que je sens couler.\n\n\nFor Bor\u00eds, Julie played most doleful nocturnes on her harp. Bor\u00eds read Poor Liza aloud to her, and more than once interrupted the reading because of the emotions that choked him. Meeting at large gatherings Julie and Bor\u00eds looked on one another as the only souls who understood one another in a world of indifferent people.\n\nAnna Mikh\u00e1ylovna, who often visited the Kar\u00e1gins, while playing cards with the mother made careful inquiries as to Julie\u2019s dowry (she was to have two estates in P\u00e9nza and the Nizheg\u00f3rod forests). Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna regarded the refined sadness that united her son to the wealthy Julie with emotion, and resignation to the Divine will.\n\n\u201cYou are always charming and melancholy, my dear Julie,\u201d she said to the daughter. \u201cBor\u00eds says his soul finds repose at your house. He has suffered so many disappointments and is so sensitive,\u201d said she to the mother. \u201cAh, my dear, I can\u2019t tell you how fond I have grown of Julie latterly,\u201d she said to her son. \u201cBut who could help loving her? She is an angelic being! Ah, Bor\u00eds, Bor\u00eds!\u201d\u2014she paused. \u201cAnd how I pity her mother,\u201d she went on; \u201ctoday she showed me her accounts and letters from P\u00e9nza (they have enormous estates there), and she, poor thing, has no one to help her, and they do cheat her so!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds smiled almost imperceptibly while listening to his mother. He laughed blandly at her na\u00efve diplomacy but listened to what she had to say, and sometimes questioned her carefully about the P\u00e9nza and Nizheg\u00f3rod estates.\n\nJulie had long been expecting a proposal from her melancholy adorer and was ready to accept it; but some secret feeling of repulsion for her, for her passionate desire to get married, for her artificiality, and a feeling of horror at renouncing the possibility of real love still restrained Bor\u00eds. His leave was expiring. He spent every day and whole days at the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019, and every day on thinking the matter over told himself that he would propose tomorrow. But in Julie\u2019s presence, looking at her red face and chin (nearly always powdered), her moist eyes, and her expression of continual readiness to pass at once from melancholy to an unnatural rapture of married bliss, Bor\u00eds could not utter the decisive words, though in imagination he had long regarded himself as the possessor of those P\u00e9nza and Nizheg\u00f3rod estates and had apportioned the use of the income from them. Julie saw Bor\u00eds\u2019 indecision, and sometimes the thought occurred to her that she was repulsive to him, but her feminine self-deception immediately supplied her with consolation, and she told herself that he was only shy from love. Her melancholy, however, began to turn to irritability, and not long before Bor\u00eds\u2019 departure she formed a definite plan of action. Just as Bor\u00eds\u2019 leave of absence was expiring, Anatole Kur\u00e1gin made his appearance in Moscow, and of course in the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019 drawing room, and Julie, suddenly abandoning her melancholy, became cheerful and very attentive to Kur\u00e1gin.\n\n\u201cMy dear,\u201d said Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna to her son, \u201cI know from a reliable source that Prince Vas\u00edli has sent his son to Moscow to get him married to Julie. I am so fond of Julie that I should be sorry for her. What do you think of it, my dear?\u201d\n\nThe idea of being made a fool of and of having thrown away that whole month of arduous melancholy service to Julie, and of seeing all the revenue from the P\u00e9nza estates which he had already mentally apportioned and put to proper use fall into the hands of another, and especially into the hands of that idiot Anatole, pained Bor\u00eds. He drove to the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019 with the firm intention of proposing. Julie met him in a gay, careless manner, spoke casually of how she had enjoyed yesterday\u2019s ball, and asked when he was leaving. Though Bor\u00eds had come intentionally to speak of his love and therefore meant to be tender, he began speaking irritably of feminine inconstancy, of how easily women can turn from sadness to joy, and how their moods depend solely on who happens to be paying court to them. Julie was offended and replied that it was true that a woman needs variety, and the same thing over and over again would weary anyone.\n\n\u201cThen I should advise you...\u201d Bor\u00eds began, wishing to sting her; but at that instant the galling thought occurred to him that he might have to leave Moscow without having accomplished his aim, and have vainly wasted his efforts\u2014which was a thing he never allowed to happen.\n\nHe checked himself in the middle of the sentence, lowered his eyes to avoid seeing her unpleasantly irritated and irresolute face, and said:\n\n\u201cI did not come here at all to quarrel with you. On the contrary...\u201d\n\nHe glanced at her to make sure that he might go on. Her irritability had suddenly quite vanished, and her anxious, imploring eyes were fixed on him with greedy expectation. \u201cI can always arrange so as not to see her often,\u201d thought Bor\u00eds. \u201cThe affair has been begun and must be finished!\u201d He blushed hotly, raised his eyes to hers, and said:\n\n\u201cYou know my feelings for you!\u201d\n\nThere was no need to say more: Julie\u2019s face shone with triumph and self-satisfaction; but she forced Bor\u00eds to say all that is said on such occasions\u2014that he loved her and had never loved any other woman more than her. She knew that for the P\u00e9nza estates and Nizheg\u00f3rod forests she could demand this, and she received what she demanded.\n\nThe affianced couple, no longer alluding to trees that shed gloom and melancholy upon them, planned the arrangements of a splendid house in Petersburg, paid calls, and prepared everything for a brilliant wedding.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the end of January old Count Rost\u00f3v went to Moscow with Nat\u00e1sha and S\u00f3nya. The countess was still unwell and unable to travel but it was impossible to wait for her recovery. Prince Andrew was expected in Moscow any day, the trousseau had to be ordered and the estate near Moscow had to be sold, besides which the opportunity of presenting his future daughter-in-law to old Prince Bolk\u00f3nski while he was in Moscow could not be missed. The Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 Moscow house had not been heated that winter and, as they had come only for a short time and the countess was not with them, the count decided to stay with M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna Akhros\u00edmova, who had long been pressing her hospitality on them.\n\nLate one evening the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 four sleighs drove into M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s courtyard in the old Kony\u00fasheny street. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna lived alone. She had already married off her daughter, and her sons were all in the service.\n\nShe held herself as erect, told everyone her opinion as candidly, loudly, and bluntly as ever, and her whole bearing seemed a reproach to others for any weakness, passion, or temptation\u2014the possibility of which she did not admit. From early in the morning, wearing a dressing jacket, she attended to her household affairs, and then she drove out: on holy days to church and after the service to jails and prisons on affairs of which she never spoke to anyone. On ordinary days, after dressing, she received petitioners of various classes, of whom there were always some. Then she had dinner, a substantial and appetizing meal at which there were always three or four guests; after dinner she played a game of boston, and at night she had the newspapers or a new book read to her while she knitted. She rarely made an exception and went out to pay visits, and then only to the most important persons in the town.\n\nShe had not yet gone to bed when the Rost\u00f3vs arrived and the pulley of the hall door squeaked from the cold as it let in the Rost\u00f3vs and their servants. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, with her spectacles hanging down on her nose and her head flung back, stood in the hall doorway looking with a stern, grim face at the new arrivals. One might have thought she was angry with the travelers and would immediately turn them out, had she not at the same time been giving careful instructions to the servants for the accommodation of the visitors and their belongings.\n\n\u201cThe count\u2019s things? Bring them here,\u201d she said, pointing to the portmanteaus and not greeting anyone. \u201cThe young ladies\u2019? There to the left. Now what are you dawdling for?\u201d she cried to the maids. \u201cGet the samovar ready!... You\u2019ve grown plumper and prettier,\u201d she remarked, drawing Nat\u00e1sha (whose cheeks were glowing from the cold) to her by the hood. \u201cFoo! You are cold! Now take off your things, quick!\u201d she shouted to the count who was going to kiss her hand. \u201cYou\u2019re half frozen, I\u2019m sure! Bring some rum for tea!... Bonjour, S\u00f3nya dear!\u201d she added, turning to S\u00f3nya and indicating by this French greeting her slightly contemptuous though affectionate attitude toward her.\n\nWhen they came in to tea, having taken off their outdoor things and tidied themselves up after their journey, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna kissed them all in due order.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m heartily glad you have come and are staying with me. It was high time,\u201d she said, giving Nat\u00e1sha a significant look. \u201cThe old man is here and his son\u2019s expected any day. You\u2019ll have to make his acquaintance. But we\u2019ll speak of that later on,\u201d she added, glancing at S\u00f3nya with a look that showed she did not want to speak of it in her presence. \u201cNow listen,\u201d she said to the count. \u201cWhat do you want tomorrow? Whom will you send for? Shinsh\u00edn?\u201d she crooked one of her fingers. \u201cThe sniveling Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna? That\u2019s two. She\u2019s here with her son. The son is getting married! Then Bez\u00fakhov, eh? He is here too, with his wife. He ran away from her and she came galloping after him. He dined with me on Wednesday. As for them\u201d\u2014and she pointed to the girls\u2014\u201ctomorrow I\u2019ll take them first to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God, and then we\u2019ll drive to the Super-Rogue\u2019s. I suppose you\u2019ll have everything new. Don\u2019t judge by me: sleeves nowadays are this size! The other day young Princess Ir\u00edna Vas\u00edlevna came to see me; she was an awful sight\u2014looked as if she had put two barrels on her arms. You know not a day passes now without some new fashion.... And what have you to do yourself?\u201d she asked the count sternly.\n\n\u201cOne thing has come on top of another: her rags to buy, and now a purchaser has turned up for the Moscow estate and for the house. If you will be so kind, I\u2019ll fix a time and go down to the estate just for a day, and leave my lassies with you.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right. All right. They\u2019ll be safe with me, as safe as in Chancery! I\u2019ll take them where they must go, scold them a bit, and pet them a bit,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, touching her goddaughter and favorite, Nat\u00e1sha, on the cheek with her large hand.\n\nNext morning M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna took the young ladies to the Iberian shrine of the Mother of God and to Madame Suppert-Roguet, who was so afraid of M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna that she always let her have costumes at a loss merely to get rid of her. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna ordered almost the whole trousseau. When they got home she turned everybody out of the room except Nat\u00e1sha, and then called her pet to her armchair.\n\n\u201cWell, now we\u2019ll talk. I congratulate you on your betrothed. You\u2019ve hooked a fine fellow! I am glad for your sake and I\u2019ve known him since he was so high.\u201d She held her hand a couple of feet from the ground. Nat\u00e1sha blushed happily. \u201cI like him and all his family. Now listen! You know that old Prince Nicholas much dislikes his son\u2019s marrying. The old fellow\u2019s crotchety! Of course Prince Andrew is not a child and can shift without him, but it\u2019s not nice to enter a family against a father\u2019s will. One wants to do it peacefully and lovingly. You\u2019re a clever girl and you\u2019ll know how to manage. Be kind, and use your wits. Then all will be well.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha remained silent, from shyness M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna supposed, but really because she disliked anyone interfering in what touched her love of Prince Andrew, which seemed to her so apart from all human affairs that no one could understand it. She loved and knew Prince Andrew, he loved her only, and was to come one of these days and take her. She wanted nothing more.\n\n\u201cYou see I have known him a long time and am also fond of Mary, your future sister-in-law. \u2018Husbands\u2019 sisters bring up blisters,\u2019 but this one wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly. She has asked me to bring you two together. Tomorrow you\u2019ll go with your father to see her. Be very nice and affectionate to her: you\u2019re younger than she. When he comes, he\u2019ll find you already know his sister and father and are liked by them. Am I right or not? Won\u2019t that be best?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it will,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha answered reluctantly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nNext day, by M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s advice, Count Rost\u00f3v took Nat\u00e1sha to call on Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski. The count did not set out cheerfully on this visit, at heart he felt afraid. He well remembered the last interview he had had with the old prince at the time of the enrollment, when in reply to an invitation to dinner he had had to listen to an angry reprimand for not having provided his full quota of men. Nat\u00e1sha, on the other hand, having put on her best gown, was in the highest spirits. \u201cThey can\u2019t help liking me,\u201d she thought. \u201cEverybody always has liked me, and I am so willing to do anything they wish, so ready to be fond of him\u2014for being his father\u2014and of her\u2014for being his sister\u2014that there is no reason for them not to like me....\u201d\n\nThey drove up to the gloomy old house on the Vozdv\u00edzhenka and entered the vestibule.\n\n\u201cWell, the Lord have mercy on us!\u201d said the count, half in jest, half in earnest; but Nat\u00e1sha noticed that her father was flurried on entering the anteroom and inquired timidly and softly whether the prince and princess were at home.\n\nWhen they had been announced a perturbation was noticeable among the servants. The footman who had gone to announce them was stopped by another in the large hall and they whispered to one another. Then a maidservant ran into the hall and hurriedly said something, mentioning the princess. At last an old, cross looking footman came and announced to the Rost\u00f3vs that the prince was not receiving, but that the princess begged them to walk up. The first person who came to meet the visitors was Mademoiselle Bourienne. She greeted the father and daughter with special politeness and showed them to the princess\u2019 room. The princess, looking excited and nervous, her face flushed in patches, ran in to meet the visitors, treading heavily, and vainly trying to appear cordial and at ease. From the first glance Princess Mary did not like Nat\u00e1sha. She thought her too fashionably dressed, frivolously gay and vain. She did not at all realize that before having seen her future sister-in-law she was prejudiced against her by involuntary envy of her beauty, youth, and happiness, as well as by jealousy of her brother\u2019s love for her. Apart from this insuperable antipathy to her, Princess Mary was agitated just then because on the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 being announced, the old prince had shouted that he did not wish to see them, that Princess Mary might do so if she chose, but they were not to be admitted to him. She had decided to receive them, but feared lest the prince might at any moment indulge in some freak, as he seemed much upset by the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 visit.\n\n\u201cThere, my dear princess, I\u2019ve brought you my songstress,\u201d said the count, bowing and looking round uneasily as if afraid the old prince might appear. \u201cI am so glad you should get to know one another... very sorry the prince is still ailing,\u201d and after a few more commonplace remarks he rose. \u201cIf you\u2019ll allow me to leave my Nat\u00e1sha in your hands for a quarter of an hour, Princess, I\u2019ll drive round to see Anna Sem\u00ebnovna, it\u2019s quite near in the Dogs\u2019 Square, and then I\u2019ll come back for her.\u201d\n\nThe count had devised this diplomatic ruse (as he afterwards told his daughter) to give the future sisters-in-law an opportunity to talk to one another freely, but another motive was to avoid the danger of encountering the old prince, of whom he was afraid. He did not mention this to his daughter, but Nat\u00e1sha noticed her father\u2019s nervousness and anxiety and felt mortified by it. She blushed for him, grew still angrier at having blushed, and looked at the princess with a bold and defiant expression which said that she was not afraid of anybody. The princess told the count that she would be delighted, and only begged him to stay longer at Anna Sem\u00ebnovna\u2019s, and he departed.\n\nDespite the uneasy glances thrown at her by Princess Mary\u2014who wished to have a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate with Nat\u00e1sha\u2014Mademoiselle Bourienne remained in the room and persistently talked about Moscow amusements and theaters. Nat\u00e1sha felt offended by the hesitation she had noticed in the anteroom, by her father\u2019s nervousness, and by the unnatural manner of the princess who\u2014she thought\u2014was making a favor of receiving her, and so everything displeased her. She did not like Princess Mary, whom she thought very plain, affected, and dry. Nat\u00e1sha suddenly shrank into herself and involuntarily assumed an offhand air which alienated Princess Mary still more. After five minutes of irksome, constrained conversation, they heard the sound of slippered feet rapidly approaching. Princess Mary looked frightened.\n\nThe door opened and the old prince, in a dressing gown and a white nightcap, came in.\n\n\u201cAh, madam!\u201d he began. \u201cMadam, Countess... Countess Rost\u00f3va, if I am not mistaken... I beg you to excuse me, to excuse me... I did not know, madam. God is my witness, I did not know you had honored us with a visit, and I came in such a costume only to see my daughter. I beg you to excuse me... God is my witness, I didn\u2019t know\u2014\u201d he repeated, stressing the word \u201cGod\u201d so unnaturally and so unpleasantly that Princess Mary stood with downcast eyes not daring to look either at her father or at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nNor did the latter, having risen and curtsied, know what to do. Mademoiselle Bourienne alone smiled agreeably.\n\n\u201cI beg you to excuse me, excuse me! God is my witness, I did not know,\u201d muttered the old man, and after looking Nat\u00e1sha over from head to foot he went out.\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne was the first to recover herself after this apparition and began speaking about the prince\u2019s indisposition. Nat\u00e1sha and Princess Mary looked at one another in silence, and the longer they did so without saying what they wanted to say, the greater grew their antipathy to one another.\n\nWhen the count returned, Nat\u00e1sha was impolitely pleased and hastened to get away: at that moment she hated the stiff, elderly princess, who could place her in such an embarrassing position and had spent half an hour with her without once mentioning Prince Andrew. \u201cI couldn\u2019t begin talking about him in the presence of that Frenchwoman,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. The same thought was meanwhile tormenting Princess Mary. She knew what she ought to have said to Nat\u00e1sha, but she had been unable to say it because Mademoiselle Bourienne was in the way, and because, without knowing why, she felt it very difficult to speak of the marriage. When the count was already leaving the room, Princess Mary went up hurriedly to Nat\u00e1sha, took her by the hand, and said with a deep sigh:\n\n\u201cWait, I must...\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha glanced at her ironically without knowing why.\n\n\u201cDear Natalie,\u201d said Princess Mary, \u201cI want you to know that I am glad my brother has found happiness....\u201d\n\nShe paused, feeling that she was not telling the truth. Nat\u00e1sha noticed this and guessed its reason.\n\n\u201cI think, Princess, it is not convenient to speak of that now,\u201d she said with external dignity and coldness, though she felt the tears choking her.\n\n\u201cWhat have I said and what have I done?\u201d thought she, as soon as she was out of the room.\n\nThey waited a long time for Nat\u00e1sha to come to dinner that day. She sat in her room crying like a child, blowing her nose and sobbing. S\u00f3nya stood beside her, kissing her hair.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, what is it about?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat do they matter to you? It will all pass, Nat\u00e1sha.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if you only knew how offensive it was... as if I...\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk about it, Nat\u00e1sha. It wasn\u2019t your fault so why should you mind? Kiss me,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\nNat\u00e1sha raised her head and, kissing her friend on the lips, pressed her wet face against her.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t tell you, I don\u2019t know. No one\u2019s to blame,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha\u2014\u201cIt\u2019s my fault. But it all hurts terribly. Oh, why doesn\u2019t he come?...\u201d\n\nShe came in to dinner with red eyes. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, who knew how the prince had received the Rost\u00f3vs, pretended not to notice how upset Nat\u00e1sha was and jested resolutely and loudly at table with the count and the other guests.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThat evening the Rost\u00f3vs went to the Opera, for which M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna had taken a box.\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not want to go, but could not refuse M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s kind offer which was intended expressly for her. When she came ready dressed into the ballroom to await her father, and looking in the large mirror there saw that she was pretty, very pretty, she felt even more sad, but it was a sweet, tender sadness.\n\n\u201cO God, if he were here now I would not behave as I did then, but differently. I would not be silly and afraid of things, I would simply embrace him, cling to him, and make him look at me with those searching inquiring eyes with which he has so often looked at me, and then I would make him laugh as he used to laugh. And his eyes\u2014how I see those eyes!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cAnd what do his father and sister matter to me? I love him alone, him, him, with that face and those eyes, with his smile, manly and yet childlike.... No, I had better not think of him; not think of him but forget him, quite forget him for the present. I can\u2019t bear this waiting and I shall cry in a minute!\u201d and she turned away from the glass, making an effort not to cry. \u201cAnd how can S\u00f3nya love Nicholas so calmly and quietly and wait so long and so patiently?\u201d thought she, looking at S\u00f3nya, who also came in quite ready, with a fan in her hand. \u201cNo, she\u2019s altogether different. I can\u2019t!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha at that moment felt so softened and tender that it was not enough for her to love and know she was beloved, she wanted now, at once, to embrace the man she loved, to speak and hear from him words of love such as filled her heart. While she sat in the carriage beside her father, pensively watching the lights of the street lamps flickering on the frozen window, she felt still sadder and more in love, and forgot where she was going and with whom. Having fallen into the line of carriages, the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 carriage drove up to the theater, its wheels squeaking over the snow. Nat\u00e1sha and S\u00f3nya, holding up their dresses, jumped out quickly. The count got out helped by the footmen, and, passing among men and women who were entering and the program sellers, they all three went along the corridor to the first row of boxes. Through the closed doors the music was already audible.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, your hair!...\u201d whispered S\u00f3nya.\n\nAn attendant deferentially and quickly slipped before the ladies and opened the door of their box. The music sounded louder and through the door rows of brightly lit boxes in which ladies sat with bare arms and shoulders, and noisy stalls brilliant with uniforms, glittered before their eyes. A lady entering the next box shot a glance of feminine envy at Nat\u00e1sha. The curtain had not yet risen and the overture was being played. Nat\u00e1sha, smoothing her gown, went in with S\u00f3nya and sat down, scanning the brilliant tiers of boxes opposite. A sensation she had not experienced for a long time\u2014that of hundreds of eyes looking at her bare arms and neck\u2014suddenly affected her both agreeably and disagreeably and called up a whole crowd of memories, desires and emotions associated with that feeling.\n\nThe two remarkably pretty girls, Nat\u00e1sha and S\u00f3nya, with Count Rost\u00f3v who had not been seen in Moscow for a long time, attracted general attention. Moreover, everybody knew vaguely of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s engagement to Prince Andrew, and knew that the Rost\u00f3vs had lived in the country ever since, and all looked with curiosity at a fianc\u00e9e who was making one of the best matches in Russia.\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s looks, as everyone told her, had improved in the country, and that evening thanks to her agitation she was particularly pretty. She struck those who saw her by her fullness of life and beauty, combined with her indifference to everything about her. Her black eyes looked at the crowd without seeking anyone, and her delicate arm, bare to above the elbow, lay on the velvet edge of the box, while, evidently unconsciously, she opened and closed her hand in time to the music, crumpling her program. \u201cLook, there\u2019s Al\u00e9nina,\u201d said S\u00f3nya, \u201cwith her mother, isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cDear me, Michael Kir\u00edlovich has grown still stouter!\u201d remarked the count.\n\n\u201cLook at our Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna\u2014what a headdress she has on!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Kar\u00e1gins, Julie\u2014and Bor\u00eds with them. One can see at once that they\u2019re engaged....\u201d\n\n\u201cDrubetsk\u00f3y has proposed?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I heard it today,\u201d said Shinsh\u00edn, coming into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box.\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked in the direction in which her father\u2019s eyes were turned and saw Julie sitting beside her mother with a happy look on her face and a string of pearls round her thick red neck\u2014which Nat\u00e1sha knew was covered with powder. Behind them, wearing a smile and leaning over with an ear to Julie\u2019s mouth, was Bor\u00eds\u2019 handsome smoothly brushed head. He looked at the Rost\u00f3vs from under his brows and said something, smiling, to his betrothed.\n\n\u201cThey are talking about us, about me and him!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cAnd he no doubt is calming her jealousy of me. They needn\u2019t trouble themselves! If only they knew how little I am concerned about any of them.\u201d\n\nBehind them sat Anna Mikh\u00e1ylovna wearing a green headdress and with a happy look of resignation to the will of God on her face. Their box was pervaded by that atmosphere of an affianced couple which Nat\u00e1sha knew so well and liked so much. She turned away and suddenly remembered all that had been so humiliating in her morning\u2019s visit.\n\n\u201cWhat right has he not to wish to receive me into his family? Oh, better not think of it\u2014not till he comes back!\u201d she told herself, and began looking at the faces, some strange and some familiar, in the stalls. In the front, in the very center, leaning back against the orchestra rail, stood D\u00f3lokhov in a Persian dress, his curly hair brushed up into a huge shock. He stood in full view of the audience, well aware that he was attracting everyone\u2019s attention, yet as much at ease as though he were in his own room. Around him thronged Moscow\u2019s most brilliant young men, whom he evidently dominated.\n\nThe count, laughing, nudged the blushing S\u00f3nya and pointed to her former adorer.\n\n\u201cDo you recognize him?\u201d said he. \u201cAnd where has he sprung from?\u201d he asked, turning to Shinsh\u00edn. \u201cDidn\u2019t he vanish somewhere?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe did,\u201d replied Shinsh\u00edn. \u201cHe was in the Caucasus and ran away from there. They say he has been acting as minister to some ruling prince in Persia, where he killed the Shah\u2019s brother. Now all the Moscow ladies are mad about him! It\u2019s \u2018D\u00f3lokhov the Persian\u2019 that does it! We never hear a word but D\u00f3lokhov is mentioned. They swear by him, they offer him to you as they would a dish of choice sterlet. D\u00f3lokhov and Anatole Kur\u00e1gin have turned all our ladies\u2019 heads.\u201d\n\nA tall, beautiful woman with a mass of plaited hair and much exposed plump white shoulders and neck, round which she wore a double string of large pearls, entered the adjoining box rustling her heavy silk dress and took a long time settling into her place.\n\nNat\u00e1sha involuntarily gazed at that neck, those shoulders, and pearls and coiffure, and admired the beauty of the shoulders and the pearls. While Nat\u00e1sha was fixing her gaze on her for the second time the lady looked round and, meeting the count\u2019s eyes, nodded to him and smiled. She was the Countess Bez\u00fakhova, Pierre\u2019s wife, and the count, who knew everyone in society, leaned over and spoke to her.\n\n\u201cHave you been here long, Countess?\u201d he inquired. \u201cI\u2019ll call, I\u2019ll call to kiss your hand. I\u2019m here on business and have brought my girls with me. They say Sem\u00ebnova acts marvelously. Count Pierre never used to forget us. Is he here?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he meant to look in,\u201d answered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, and glanced attentively at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nCount Rost\u00f3v resumed his seat.\n\n\u201cHandsome, isn\u2019t she?\u201d he whispered to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cWonderful!\u201d answered Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman one could easily fall in love with.\u201d\n\nJust then the last chords of the overture were heard and the conductor tapped with his stick. Some latecomers took their seats in the stalls, and the curtain rose.\n\nAs soon as it rose everyone in the boxes and stalls became silent, and all the men, old and young, in uniform and evening dress, and all the women with gems on their bare flesh, turned their whole attention with eager curiosity to the stage. Nat\u00e1sha too began to look at it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe floor of the stage consisted of smooth boards, at the sides was some painted cardboard representing trees, and at the back was a cloth stretched over boards. In the center of the stage sat some girls in red bodices and white skirts. One very fat girl in a white silk dress sat apart on a low bench, to the back of which a piece of green cardboard was glued. They all sang something. When they had finished their song the girl in white went up to the prompter\u2019s box and a man with tight silk trousers over his stout legs, and holding a plume and a dagger, went up to her and began singing, waving his arms about.\n\nFirst the man in the tight trousers sang alone, then she sang, then they both paused while the orchestra played and the man fingered the hand of the girl in white, obviously awaiting the beat to start singing with her. They sang together and everyone in the theater began clapping and shouting, while the man and woman on the stage\u2014who represented lovers\u2014began smiling, spreading out their arms, and bowing.\n\nAfter her life in the country, and in her present serious mood, all this seemed grotesque and amazing to Nat\u00e1sha. She could not follow the opera nor even listen to the music; she saw only the painted cardboard and the queerly dressed men and women who moved, spoke, and sang so strangely in that brilliant light. She knew what it was all meant to represent, but it was so pretentiously false and unnatural that she first felt ashamed for the actors and then amused at them. She looked at the faces of the audience, seeking in them the same sense of ridicule and perplexity she herself experienced, but they all seemed attentive to what was happening on the stage, and expressed delight which to Nat\u00e1sha seemed feigned. \u201cI suppose it has to be like this!\u201d she thought. She kept looking round in turn at the rows of pomaded heads in the stalls and then at the seminude women in the boxes, especially at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in the next box, who\u2014apparently quite unclothed\u2014sat with a quiet tranquil smile, not taking her eyes off the stage. And feeling the bright light that flooded the whole place and the warm air heated by the crowd, Nat\u00e1sha little by little began to pass into a state of intoxication she had not experienced for a long while. She did not realize who and where she was, nor what was going on before her. As she looked and thought, the strangest fancies unexpectedly and disconnectedly passed through her mind: the idea occurred to her of jumping onto the edge of the box and singing the aria the actress was singing, then she wished to touch with her fan an old gentleman sitting not far from her, then to lean over to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and tickle her.\n\nAt a moment when all was quiet before the commencement of a song, a door leading to the stalls on the side nearest the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box creaked, and the steps of a belated arrival were heard. \u201cThere\u2019s Kur\u00e1gin!\u201d whispered Shinsh\u00edn. Countess Bez\u00fakhova turned smiling to the newcomer, and Nat\u00e1sha, following the direction of that look, saw an exceptionally handsome adjutant approaching their box with a self-assured yet courteous bearing. This was Anatole Kur\u00e1gin whom she had seen and noticed long ago at the ball in Petersburg. He was now in an adjutant\u2019s uniform with one epaulet and a shoulder knot. He moved with a restrained swagger which would have been ridiculous had he not been so good-looking and had his handsome face not worn such an expression of good-humored complacency and gaiety. Though the performance was proceeding, he walked deliberately down the carpeted gangway, his sword and spurs slightly jingling and his handsome perfumed head held high. Having looked at Nat\u00e1sha he approached his sister, laid his well gloved hand on the edge of her box, nodded to her, and leaning forward asked a question, with a motion toward Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cMais charmante!\u201d said he, evidently referring to Nat\u00e1sha, who did not exactly hear his words but understood them from the movement of his lips. Then he took his place in the first row of the stalls and sat down beside D\u00f3lokhov, nudging with his elbow in a friendly and offhand way that D\u00f3lokhov whom others treated so fawningly. He winked at him gaily, smiled, and rested his foot against the orchestra screen.\n\n\u201cHow like the brother is to the sister,\u201d remarked the count. \u201cAnd how handsome they both are!\u201d\n\nShinsh\u00edn, lowering his voice, began to tell the count of some intrigue of Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s in Moscow, and Nat\u00e1sha tried to overhear it just because he had said she was \u201ccharmante.\u201d\n\nThe first act was over. In the stalls everyone began moving about, going out and coming in.\n\nBor\u00eds came to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box, received their congratulations very simply, and raising his eyebrows with an absent-minded smile conveyed to Nat\u00e1sha and S\u00f3nya his fianc\u00e9e\u2019s invitation to her wedding, and went away. Nat\u00e1sha with a gay, coquettish smile talked to him, and congratulated on his approaching wedding that same Bor\u00eds with whom she had formerly been in love. In the state of intoxication she was in, everything seemed simple and natural.\n\nThe scantily clad H\u00e9l\u00e8ne smiled at everyone in the same way, and Nat\u00e1sha gave Bor\u00eds a similar smile.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s box was filled and surrounded from the stalls by the most distinguished and intellectual men, who seemed to vie with one another in their wish to let everyone see that they knew her.\n\nDuring the whole of that entr\u2019acte Kur\u00e1gin stood with D\u00f3lokhov in front of the orchestra partition, looking at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box. Nat\u00e1sha knew he was talking about her and this afforded her pleasure. She even turned so that he should see her profile in what she thought was its most becoming aspect. Before the beginning of the second act Pierre appeared in the stalls. The Rost\u00f3vs had not seen him since their arrival. His face looked sad, and he had grown still stouter since Nat\u00e1sha last saw him. He passed up to the front rows, not noticing anyone. Anatole went up to him and began speaking to him, looking at and indicating the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box. On seeing Nat\u00e1sha Pierre grew animated and, hastily passing between the rows, came toward their box. When he got there he leaned on his elbows and, smiling, talked to her for a long time. While conversing with Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha heard a man\u2019s voice in Countess Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s box and something told her it was Kur\u00e1gin. She turned and their eyes met. Almost smiling, he gazed straight into her eyes with such an enraptured caressing look that it seemed strange to be so near him, to look at him like that, to be so sure he admired her, and not to be acquainted with him.\n\nIn the second act there was scenery representing tombstones, there was a round hole in the canvas to represent the moon, shades were raised over the footlights, and from horns and contrabass came deep notes while many people appeared from right and left wearing black cloaks and holding things like daggers in their hands. They began waving their arms. Then some other people ran in and began dragging away the maiden who had been in white and was now in light blue. They did not drag her away at once, but sang with her for a long time and then at last dragged her off, and behind the scenes something metallic was struck three times and everyone knelt down and sang a prayer. All these things were repeatedly interrupted by the enthusiastic shouts of the audience.\n\nDuring this act every time Nat\u00e1sha looked toward the stalls she saw Anatole Kur\u00e1gin with an arm thrown across the back of his chair, staring at her. She was pleased to see that he was captivated by her and it did not occur to her that there was anything wrong in it.\n\nWhen the second act was over Countess Bez\u00fakhova rose, turned to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 box\u2014her whole bosom completely exposed\u2014beckoned the old count with a gloved finger, and paying no attention to those who had entered her box began talking to him with an amiable smile.\n\n\u201cDo make me acquainted with your charming daughters,\u201d said she. \u201cThe whole town is singing their praises and I don\u2019t even know them!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha rose and curtsied to the splendid countess. She was so pleased by praise from this brilliant beauty that she blushed with pleasure.\n\n\u201cI want to become a Moscovite too, now,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cHow is it you\u2019re not ashamed to bury such pearls in the country?\u201d\n\nCountess Bez\u00fakhova quite deserved her reputation of being a fascinating woman. She could say what she did not think\u2014especially what was flattering\u2014quite simply and naturally.\n\n\u201cDear count, you must let me look after your daughters! Though I am not staying here long this time\u2014nor are you\u2014I will try to amuse them. I have already heard much of you in Petersburg and wanted to get to know you,\u201d said she to Nat\u00e1sha with her stereotyped and lovely smile. \u201cI had heard about you from my page, Drubetsk\u00f3y. Have you heard he is getting married? And also from my husband\u2019s friend Bolk\u00f3nski, Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski,\u201d she went on with special emphasis, implying that she knew of his relation to Nat\u00e1sha. To get better acquainted she asked that one of the young ladies should come into her box for the rest of the performance, and Nat\u00e1sha moved over to it.\n\nThe scene of the third act represented a palace in which many candles were burning and pictures of knights with short beards hung on the walls. In the middle stood what were probably a king and a queen. The king waved his right arm and, evidently nervous, sang something badly and sat down on a crimson throne. The maiden who had been first in white and then in light blue, now wore only a smock, and stood beside the throne with her hair down. She sang something mournfully, addressing the queen, but the king waved his arm severely, and men and women with bare legs came in from both sides and began dancing all together. Then the violins played very shrilly and merrily and one of the women with thick bare legs and thin arms, separating from the others, went behind the wings, adjusted her bodice, returned to the middle of the stage, and began jumping and striking one foot rapidly against the other. In the stalls everyone clapped and shouted \u201cbravo!\u201d Then one of the men went into a corner of the stage. The cymbals and horns in the orchestra struck up more loudly, and this man with bare legs jumped very high and waved his feet about very rapidly. (He was Duport, who received sixty thousand rubles a year for this art.) Everybody in the stalls, boxes, and galleries began clapping and shouting with all their might, and the man stopped and began smiling and bowing to all sides. Then other men and women danced with bare legs. Then the king again shouted to the sound of music, and they all began singing. But suddenly a storm came on, chromatic scales and diminished sevenths were heard in the orchestra, everyone ran off, again dragging one of their number away, and the curtain dropped. Once more there was a terrible noise and clatter among the audience, and with rapturous faces everyone began shouting: \u201cDuport! Duport! Duport!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha no longer thought this strange. She looked about with pleasure, smiling joyfully.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t Duport delightful?\u201d H\u00e9l\u00e8ne asked her.\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nDuring the entr\u2019acte a whiff of cold air came into H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s box, the door opened, and Anatole entered, stooping and trying not to brush against anyone.\n\n\u201cLet me introduce my brother to you,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, her eyes shifting uneasily from Nat\u00e1sha to Anatole.\n\nNat\u00e1sha turned her pretty little head toward the elegant young officer and smiled at him over her bare shoulder. Anatole, who was as handsome at close quarters as at a distance, sat down beside her and told her he had long wished to have this happiness\u2014ever since the Nar\u00fdshkins\u2019 ball in fact, at which he had had the well-remembered pleasure of seeing her. Kur\u00e1gin was much more sensible and simple with women than among men. He talked boldly and naturally, and Nat\u00e1sha was strangely and agreeably struck by the fact that there was nothing formidable in this man about whom there was so much talk, but that on the contrary his smile was most na\u00efve, cheerful, and good-natured.\n\nKur\u00e1gin asked her opinion of the performance and told her how at a previous performance Sem\u00ebnova had fallen down on the stage.\n\n\u201cAnd do you know, Countess,\u201d he said, suddenly addressing her as an old, familiar acquaintance, \u201cwe are getting up a costume tournament; you ought to take part in it! It will be great fun. We shall all meet at the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019! Please come! No! Really, eh?\u201d said he.\n\nWhile saying this he never removed his smiling eyes from her face, her neck, and her bare arms. Nat\u00e1sha knew for certain that he was enraptured by her. This pleased her, yet his presence made her feel constrained and oppressed. When she was not looking at him she felt that he was looking at her shoulders, and she involuntarily caught his eye so that he should look into hers rather than this. But looking into his eyes she was frightened, realizing that there was not that barrier of modesty she had always felt between herself and other men. She did not know how it was that within five minutes she had come to feel herself terribly near to this man. When she turned away she feared he might seize her from behind by her bare arm and kiss her on the neck. They spoke of most ordinary things, yet she felt that they were closer to one another than she had ever been to any man. Nat\u00e1sha kept turning to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and to her father, as if asking what it all meant, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was engaged in conversation with a general and did not answer her look, and her father\u2019s eyes said nothing but what they always said: \u201cHaving a good time? Well, I\u2019m glad of it!\u201d\n\nDuring one of these moments of awkward silence when Anatole\u2019s prominent eyes were gazing calmly and fixedly at her, Nat\u00e1sha, to break the silence, asked him how he liked Moscow. She asked the question and blushed. She felt all the time that by talking to him she was doing something improper. Anatole smiled as though to encourage her.\n\n\u201cAt first I did not like it much, because what makes a town pleasant ce sont les jolies femmes, isn\u2019t that so? But now I like it very much indeed,\u201d he said, looking at her significantly. \u201cYou\u2019ll come to the costume tournament, Countess? Do come!\u201d and putting out his hand to her bouquet and dropping his voice, he added, \u201cYou will be the prettiest there. Do come, dear countess, and give me this flower as a pledge!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not understand what he was saying any more than he did himself, but she felt that his incomprehensible words had an improper intention. She did not know what to say and turned away as if she had not heard his remark. But as soon as she had turned away she felt that he was there, behind, so close behind her.\n\n\u201cHow is he now? Confused? Angry? Ought I to put it right?\u201d she asked herself, and she could not refrain from turning round. She looked straight into his eyes, and his nearness, self-assurance, and the good-natured tenderness of his smile vanquished her. She smiled just as he was doing, gazing straight into his eyes. And again she felt with horror that no barrier lay between him and her.\n\nThe curtain rose again. Anatole left the box, serene and gay. Nat\u00e1sha went back to her father in the other box, now quite submissive to the world she found herself in. All that was going on before her now seemed quite natural, but on the other hand all her previous thoughts of her betrothed, of Princess Mary, or of life in the country did not once recur to her mind and were as if belonging to a remote past.\n\nIn the fourth act there was some sort of devil who sang waving his arm about, till the boards were withdrawn from under him and he disappeared down below. That was the only part of the fourth act that Nat\u00e1sha saw. She felt agitated and tormented, and the cause of this was Kur\u00e1gin whom she could not help watching. As they were leaving the theater Anatole came up to them, called their carriage, and helped them in. As he was putting Nat\u00e1sha in he pressed her arm above the elbow. Agitated and flushed she turned round. He was looking at her with glittering eyes, smiling tenderly.\n\n\nOnly after she had reached home was Nat\u00e1sha able clearly to think over what had happened to her, and suddenly remembering Prince Andrew she was horrified, and at tea to which all had sat down after the opera, she gave a loud exclamation, flushed, and ran out of the room.\n\n\u201cO God! I am lost!\u201d she said to herself. \u201cHow could I let him?\u201d She sat for a long time hiding her flushed face in her hands trying to realize what had happened to her, but was unable either to understand what had happened or what she felt. Everything seemed dark, obscure, and terrible. There in that enormous, illuminated theater where the bare-legged Duport, in a tinsel-decorated jacket, jumped about to the music on wet boards, and young girls and old men, and the nearly naked H\u00e9l\u00e8ne with her proud, calm smile, rapturously cried \u201cbravo!\u201d\u2014there in the presence of that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne it had all seemed clear and simple; but now, alone by herself, it was incomprehensible. \u201cWhat is it? What was that terror I felt of him? What is this gnawing of conscience I am feeling now?\u201d she thought.\n\nOnly to the old countess at night in bed could Nat\u00e1sha have told all she was feeling. She knew that S\u00f3nya with her severe and simple views would either not understand it at all or would be horrified at such a confession. So Nat\u00e1sha tried to solve what was torturing her by herself.\n\n\u201cAm I spoiled for Andrew\u2019s love or not?\u201d she asked herself, and with soothing irony replied: \u201cWhat a fool I am to ask that! What did happen to me? Nothing! I have done nothing, I didn\u2019t lead him on at all. Nobody will know and I shall never see him again,\u201d she told herself. \u201cSo it is plain that nothing has happened and there is nothing to repent of, and Andrew can love me still. But why \u2018still?\u2019 O God, why isn\u2019t he here?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha quieted herself for a moment, but again some instinct told her that though all this was true, and though nothing had happened, yet the former purity of her love for Prince Andrew had perished. And again in imagination she went over her whole conversation with Kur\u00e1gin, and again saw the face, gestures, and tender smile of that bold handsome man when he pressed her arm.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nAnatole Kur\u00e1gin was staying in Moscow because his father had sent him away from Petersburg, where he had been spending twenty thousand rubles a year in cash, besides running up debts for as much more, which his creditors demanded from his father.\n\nHis father announced to him that he would now pay half his debts for the last time, but only on condition that he went to Moscow as adjutant to the commander in chief\u2014a post his father had procured for him\u2014and would at last try to make a good match there. He indicated to him Princess Mary and Julie Kar\u00e1gina.\n\nAnatole consented and went to Moscow, where he put up at Pierre\u2019s house. Pierre received him unwillingly at first, but got used to him after a while, sometimes even accompanied him on his carousals, and gave him money under the guise of loans.\n\nAs Shinsh\u00edn had remarked, from the time of his arrival Anatole had turned the heads of the Moscow ladies, especially by the fact that he slighted them and plainly preferred the gypsy girls and French actresses\u2014with the chief of whom, Mademoiselle George, he was said to be on intimate relations. He had never missed a carousal at Dan\u00edlov\u2019s or other Moscow revelers\u2019, drank whole nights through, outvying everyone else, and was at all the balls and parties of the best society. There was talk of his intrigues with some of the ladies, and he flirted with a few of them at the balls. But he did not run after the unmarried girls, especially the rich heiresses who were most of them plain. There was a special reason for this, as he had got married two years before\u2014a fact known only to his most intimate friends. At that time while with his regiment in Poland, a Polish landowner of small means had forced him to marry his daughter. Anatole had very soon abandoned his wife and, for a payment which he agreed to send to his father-in-law, had arranged to be free to pass himself off as a bachelor.\n\nAnatole was always content with his position, with himself, and with others. He was instinctively and thoroughly convinced that it was impossible for him to live otherwise than as he did and that he had never in his life done anything base. He was incapable of considering how his actions might affect others or what the consequences of this or that action of his might be. He was convinced that, as a duck is so made that it must live in water, so God had made him such that he must spend thirty thousand rubles a year and always occupy a prominent position in society. He believed this so firmly that others, looking at him, were persuaded of it too and did not refuse him either a leading place in society or money, which he borrowed from anyone and everyone and evidently would not repay.\n\nHe was not a gambler, at any rate he did not care about winning. He was not vain. He did not mind what people thought of him. Still less could he be accused of ambition. More than once he had vexed his father by spoiling his own career, and he laughed at distinctions of all kinds. He was not mean, and did not refuse anyone who asked of him. All he cared about was gaiety and women, and as according to his ideas there was nothing dishonorable in these tastes, and he was incapable of considering what the gratification of his tastes entailed for others, he honestly considered himself irreproachable, sincerely despised rogues and bad people, and with a tranquil conscience carried his head high.\n\nRakes, those male Magdalenes, have a secret feeling of innocence similar to that which female Magdalenes have, based on the same hope of forgiveness. \u201cAll will be forgiven her, for she loved much; and all will be forgiven him, for he enjoyed much.\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov, who had reappeared that year in Moscow after his exile and his Persian adventures, and was leading a life of luxury, gambling, and dissipation, associated with his old Petersburg comrade Kur\u00e1gin and made use of him for his own ends.\n\nAnatole was sincerely fond of D\u00f3lokhov for his cleverness and audacity. D\u00f3lokhov, who needed Anatole Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s name, position, and connections as a bait to draw rich young men into his gambling set, made use of him and amused himself at his expense without letting the other feel it. Apart from the advantage he derived from Anatole, the very process of dominating another\u2019s will was in itself a pleasure, a habit, and a necessity to D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nNat\u00e1sha had made a strong impression on Kur\u00e1gin. At supper after the opera he described to D\u00f3lokhov with the air of a connoisseur the attractions of her arms, shoulders, feet, and hair and expressed his intention of making love to her. Anatole had no notion and was incapable of considering what might come of such love-making, as he never had any notion of the outcome of any of his actions.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s first-rate, my dear fellow, but not for us,\u201d replied D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cI will tell my sister to ask her to dinner,\u201d said Anatole. \u201cEh?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019d better wait till she\u2019s married....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, I adore little girls, they lose their heads at once,\u201d pursued Anatole.\n\n\u201cYou have been caught once already by a \u2018little girl,\u2019\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov who knew of Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s marriage. \u201cTake care!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that can\u2019t happen twice! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, with a good-humored laugh.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe day after the opera the Rost\u00f3vs went nowhere and nobody came to see them. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna talked to the count about something which they concealed from Nat\u00e1sha. Nat\u00e1sha guessed they were talking about the old prince and planning something, and this disquieted and offended her. She was expecting Prince Andrew any moment and twice that day sent a manservant to the Vozdv\u00edzhenka to ascertain whether he had come. He had not arrived. She suffered more now than during her first days in Moscow. To her impatience and pining for him were now added the unpleasant recollection of her interview with Princess Mary and the old prince, and a fear and anxiety of which she did not understand the cause. She continually fancied that either he would never come or that something would happen to her before he came. She could no longer think of him by herself calmly and continuously as she had done before. As soon as she began to think of him, the recollection of the old prince, of Princess Mary, of the theater, and of Kur\u00e1gin mingled with her thoughts. The question again presented itself whether she was not guilty, whether she had not already broken faith with Prince Andrew, and again she found herself recalling to the minutest detail every word, every gesture, and every shade in the play of expression on the face of the man who had been able to arouse in her such an incomprehensible and terrifying feeling. To the family Nat\u00e1sha seemed livelier than usual, but she was far less tranquil and happy than before.\n\nOn Sunday morning M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna invited her visitors to Mass at her parish church\u2014the Church of the Assumption built over the graves of victims of the plague.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like those fashionable churches,\u201d she said, evidently priding herself on her independence of thought. \u201cGod is the same everywhere. We have an excellent priest, he conducts the service decently and with dignity, and the deacon is the same. What holiness is there in giving concerts in the choir? I don\u2019t like it, it\u2019s just self-indulgence!\u201d\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna liked Sundays and knew how to keep them. Her whole house was scrubbed and cleaned on Saturdays; neither she nor the servants worked, and they all wore holiday dress and went to church. At her table there were extra dishes at dinner, and the servants had vodka and roast goose or suckling pig. But in nothing in the house was the holiday so noticeable as in M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s broad, stern face, which on that day wore an invariable look of solemn festivity.\n\nAfter Mass, when they had finished their coffee in the dining room where the loose covers had been removed from the furniture, a servant announced that the carriage was ready, and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna rose with a stern air. She wore her holiday shawl, in which she paid calls, and announced that she was going to see Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski to have an explanation with him about Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nAfter she had gone, a dressmaker from Madame Suppert-Roguet waited on the Rost\u00f3vs, and Nat\u00e1sha, very glad of this diversion, having shut herself into a room adjoining the drawing room, occupied herself trying on the new dresses. Just as she had put on a bodice without sleeves and only tacked together, and was turning her head to see in the glass how the back fitted, she heard in the drawing room the animated sounds of her father\u2019s voice and another\u2019s\u2014a woman\u2019s\u2014that made her flush. It was H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. Nat\u00e1sha had not time to take off the bodice before the door opened and Countess Bez\u00fakhova, dressed in a purple velvet gown with a high collar, came into the room beaming with good-humored amiable smiles.\n\n\u201cOh, my enchantress!\u201d she cried to the blushing Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cCharming! No, this is really beyond anything, my dear count,\u201d said she to Count Rost\u00f3v who had followed her in. \u201cHow can you live in Moscow and go nowhere? No, I won\u2019t let you off! Mademoiselle George will recite at my house tonight and there\u2019ll be some people, and if you don\u2019t bring your lovely girls\u2014who are prettier than Mademoiselle George\u2014I won\u2019t know you! My husband is away in Tver or I would send him to fetch you. You must come. You positively must! Between eight and nine.\u201d\n\nShe nodded to the dressmaker, whom she knew and who had curtsied respectfully to her, and seated herself in an armchair beside the looking glass, draping the folds of her velvet dress picturesquely. She did not cease chattering good-naturedly and gaily, continually praising Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s beauty. She looked at Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s dresses and praised them, as well as a new dress of her own made of \u201cmetallic gauze,\u201d which she had received from Paris, and advised Nat\u00e1sha to have one like it.\n\n\u201cBut anything suits you, my charmer!\u201d she remarked.\n\nA smile of pleasure never left Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face. She felt happy and as if she were blossoming under the praise of this dear Countess Bez\u00fakhova who had formerly seemed to her so unapproachable and important and was now so kind to her. Nat\u00e1sha brightened up and felt almost in love with this woman, who was so beautiful and so kind. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne for her part was sincerely delighted with Nat\u00e1sha and wished to give her a good time. Anatole had asked her to bring him and Nat\u00e1sha together, and she was calling on the Rost\u00f3vs for that purpose. The idea of throwing her brother and Nat\u00e1sha together amused her.\n\nThough at one time, in Petersburg, she had been annoyed with Nat\u00e1sha for drawing Bor\u00eds away, she did not think of that now, and in her own way heartily wished Nat\u00e1sha well. As she was leaving the Rost\u00f3vs she called her prot\u00e9g\u00e9e aside.\n\n\u201cMy brother dined with me yesterday\u2014we nearly died of laughter\u2014he ate nothing and kept sighing for you, my charmer! He is madly, quite madly, in love with you, my dear.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha blushed scarlet when she heard this.\n\n\u201cHow she blushes, how she blushes, my pretty!\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne. \u201cYou must certainly come. If you love somebody, my charmer, that is not a reason to shut yourself up. Even if you are engaged, I am sure your fianc\u00e9 would wish you to go into society rather than be bored to death.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo she knows I am engaged, and she and her husband Pierre\u2014that good Pierre\u2014have talked and laughed about this. So it\u2019s all right.\u201d And again, under H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s influence, what had seemed terrible now seemed simple and natural. \u201cAnd she is such a grande dame, so kind, and evidently likes me so much. And why not enjoy myself?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha, gazing at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne with wide-open, wondering eyes.\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna came back to dinner taciturn and serious, having evidently suffered a defeat at the old prince\u2019s. She was still too agitated by the encounter to be able to talk of the affair calmly. In answer to the count\u2019s inquiries she replied that things were all right and that she would tell about it next day. On hearing of Countess Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s visit and the invitation for that evening, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna remarked:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t care to have anything to do with Bez\u00fakhova and don\u2019t advise you to; however, if you\u2019ve promised\u2014go. It will divert your thoughts,\u201d she added, addressing Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nCount Rost\u00f3v took the girls to Countess Bez\u00fakhova\u2019s. There were a good many people there, but nearly all strangers to Nat\u00e1sha. Count Rost\u00f3v was displeased to see that the company consisted almost entirely of men and women known for the freedom of their conduct. Mademoiselle George was standing in a corner of the drawing room surrounded by young men. There were several Frenchmen present, among them M\u00e9tivier who from the time H\u00e9l\u00e8ne reached Moscow had been an intimate in her house. The count decided not to sit down to cards or let his girls out of his sight and to get away as soon as Mademoiselle George\u2019s performance was over.\n\nAnatole was at the door, evidently on the lookout for the Rost\u00f3vs. Immediately after greeting the count he went up to Nat\u00e1sha and followed her. As soon as she saw him she was seized by the same feeling she had had at the opera\u2014gratified vanity at his admiration of her and fear at the absence of a moral barrier between them.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne welcomed Nat\u00e1sha delightedly and was loud in admiration of her beauty and her dress. Soon after their arrival Mademoiselle George went out of the room to change her costume. In the drawing room people began arranging the chairs and taking their seats. Anatole moved a chair for Nat\u00e1sha and was about to sit down beside her, but the count, who never lost sight of her, took the seat himself. Anatole sat down behind her.\n\nMademoiselle George, with her bare, fat, dimpled arms, and a red shawl draped over one shoulder, came into the space left vacant for her, and assumed an unnatural pose. Enthusiastic whispering was audible.\n\nMademoiselle George looked sternly and gloomily at the audience and began reciting some French verses describing her guilty love for her son. In some places she raised her voice, in others she whispered, lifting her head triumphantly; sometimes she paused and uttered hoarse sounds, rolling her eyes.\n\n\u201cAdorable! divine! delicious!\u201d was heard from every side.\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at the fat actress, but neither saw nor heard nor understood anything of what went on before her. She only felt herself again completely borne away into this strange senseless world\u2014so remote from her old world\u2014a world in which it was impossible to know what was good or bad, reasonable or senseless. Behind her sat Anatole, and conscious of his proximity she experienced a frightened sense of expectancy.\n\nAfter the first monologue the whole company rose and surrounded Mademoiselle George, expressing their enthusiasm.\n\n\u201cHow beautiful she is!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha remarked to her father who had also risen and was moving through the crowd toward the actress.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think so when I look at you!\u201d said Anatole, following Nat\u00e1sha. He said this at a moment when she alone could hear him. \u201cYou are enchanting... from the moment I saw you I have never ceased...\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, come, Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d said the count, as he turned back for his daughter. \u201cHow beautiful she is!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha without saying anything stepped up to her father and looked at him with surprised inquiring eyes.\n\nAfter giving several recitations, Mademoiselle George left, and Countess Bez\u00fakhova asked her visitors into the ballroom.\n\nThe count wished to go home, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne entreated him not to spoil her improvised ball, and the Rost\u00f3vs stayed on. Anatole asked Nat\u00e1sha for a valse and as they danced he pressed her waist and hand and told her she was bewitching and that he loved her. During the \u00e9cossaise, which she also danced with him, Anatole said nothing when they happened to be by themselves, but merely gazed at her. Nat\u00e1sha lifted her frightened eyes to him, but there was such confident tenderness in his affectionate look and smile that she could not, whilst looking at him, say what she had to say. She lowered her eyes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say such things to me. I am betrothed and love another,\u201d she said rapidly.... She glanced at him.\n\nAnatole was not upset or pained by what she had said.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me of that! What can I do?\u201d said he. \u201cI tell you I am madly, madly, in love with you! Is it my fault that you are enchanting?... It\u2019s our turn to begin.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha, animated and excited, looked about her with wide-open frightened eyes and seemed merrier than usual. She understood hardly anything that went on that evening. They danced the \u00e9cossaise and the Grossvater. Her father asked her to come home, but she begged to remain. Wherever she went and whomever she was speaking to, she felt his eyes upon her. Later on she recalled how she had asked her father to let her go to the dressing room to rearrange her dress, that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had followed her and spoken laughingly of her brother\u2019s love, and that she again met Anatole in the little sitting room. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne had disappeared leaving them alone, and Anatole had taken her hand and said in a tender voice:\n\n\u201cI cannot come to visit you but is it possible that I shall never see you? I love you madly. Can I never...?\u201d and, blocking her path, he brought his face close to hers.\n\nHis large, glittering, masculine eyes were so close to hers that she saw nothing but them.\n\n\u201cNatalie?\u201d he whispered inquiringly while she felt her hands being painfully pressed. \u201cNatalie?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I have nothing to say,\u201d her eyes replied.\n\nBurning lips were pressed to hers, and at the same instant she felt herself released, and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s footsteps and the rustle of her dress were heard in the room. Nat\u00e1sha looked round at her, and then, red and trembling, threw a frightened look of inquiry at Anatole and moved toward the door.\n\n\u201cOne word, just one, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d cried Anatole.\n\nShe paused. She so wanted a word from him that would explain to her what had happened and to which she could find no answer.\n\n\u201cNatalie, just a word, only one!\u201d he kept repeating, evidently not knowing what to say and he repeated it till H\u00e9l\u00e8ne came up to them.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne returned with Nat\u00e1sha to the drawing room. The Rost\u00f3vs went away without staying for supper.\n\nAfter reaching home Nat\u00e1sha did not sleep all night. She was tormented by the insoluble question whether she loved Anatole or Prince Andrew. She loved Prince Andrew\u2014she remembered distinctly how deeply she loved him. But she also loved Anatole, of that there was no doubt. \u201cElse how could all this have happened?\u201d thought she. \u201cIf, after that, I could return his smile when saying good-by, if I was able to let it come to that, it means that I loved him from the first. It means that he is kind, noble, and splendid, and I could not help loving him. What am I to do if I love him and the other one too?\u201d she asked herself, unable to find an answer to these terrible questions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMorning came with its cares and bustle. Everyone got up and began to move about and talk, dressmakers came again. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna appeared, and they were called to breakfast. Nat\u00e1sha kept looking uneasily at everybody with wide-open eyes, as if wishing to intercept every glance directed toward her, and tried to appear the same as usual.\n\nAfter breakfast, which was her best time, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna sat down in her armchair and called Nat\u00e1sha and the count to her.\n\n\u201cWell, friends, I have now thought the whole matter over and this is my advice,\u201d she began. \u201cYesterday, as you know, I went to see Prince Bolk\u00f3nski. Well, I had a talk with him.... He took it into his head to begin shouting, but I am not one to be shouted down. I said what I had to say!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and he?\u201d asked the count.\n\n\u201cHe? He\u2019s crazy... he did not want to listen. But what\u2019s the use of talking? As it is we have worn the poor girl out,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cMy advice to you is finish your business and go back home to Otr\u00e1dnoe... and wait there.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cYes, go back,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, \u201cand wait there. If your betrothed comes here now\u2014there will be no avoiding a quarrel; but alone with the old man he will talk things over and then come on to you.\u201d\n\nCount Rost\u00f3v approved of this suggestion, appreciating its reasonableness. If the old man came round it would be all the better to visit him in Moscow or at Bald Hills later on; and if not, the wedding, against his wishes, could only be arranged at Otr\u00e1dnoe.\n\n\u201cThat is perfectly true. And I am sorry I went to see him and took her,\u201d said the old count.\n\n\u201cNo, why be sorry? Being here, you had to pay your respects. But if he won\u2019t\u2014that\u2019s his affair,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, looking for something in her reticule. \u201cBesides, the trousseau is ready, so there is nothing to wait for; and what is not ready I\u2019ll send after you. Though I don\u2019t like letting you go, it is the best way. So go, with God\u2019s blessing!\u201d\n\nHaving found what she was looking for in the reticule she handed it to Nat\u00e1sha. It was a letter from Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cShe has written to you. How she torments herself, poor thing! She\u2019s afraid you might think that she does not like you.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d cried M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\n\u201cI shan\u2019t believe anyone, I know she doesn\u2019t like me,\u201d replied Nat\u00e1sha boldly as she took the letter, and her face expressed a cold and angry resolution that caused M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna to look at her more intently and to", "sequence": 14}, {"offset": 1500000, "text": " frown.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t answer like that, my good girl!\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I say is true! Write an answer!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not reply and went to her own room to read Princess Mary\u2019s letter.\n\nPrincess Mary wrote that she was in despair at the misunderstanding that had occurred between them. Whatever her father\u2019s feelings might be, she begged Nat\u00e1sha to believe that she could not help loving her as the one chosen by her brother, for whose happiness she was ready to sacrifice everything.\n\n\u201cDo not think, however,\u201d she wrote, \u201cthat my father is ill-disposed toward you. He is an invalid and an old man who must be forgiven; but he is good and magnanimous and will love her who makes his son happy.\u201d Princess Mary went on to ask Nat\u00e1sha to fix a time when she could see her again.\n\nAfter reading the letter Nat\u00e1sha sat down at the writing table to answer it. \u201cDear Princess,\u201d she wrote in French quickly and mechanically, and then paused. What more could she write after all that had happened the evening before? \u201cYes, yes! All that has happened, and now all is changed,\u201d she thought as she sat with the letter she had begun before her. \u201cMust I break off with him? Must I really? That\u2019s awful...\u201d and to escape from these dreadful thoughts she went to S\u00f3nya and began sorting patterns with her.\n\nAfter dinner Nat\u00e1sha went to her room and again took up Princess Mary\u2019s letter. \u201cCan it be that it is all over?\u201d she thought. \u201cCan it be that all this has happened so quickly and has destroyed all that went before?\u201d She recalled her love for Prince Andrew in all its former strength, and at the same time felt that she loved Kur\u00e1gin. She vividly pictured herself as Prince Andrew\u2019s wife, and the scenes of happiness with him she had so often repeated in her imagination, and at the same time, aglow with excitement, recalled every detail of yesterday\u2019s interview with Anatole.\n\n\u201cWhy could that not be as well?\u201d she sometimes asked herself in complete bewilderment. \u201cOnly so could I be completely happy; but now I have to choose, and I can\u2019t be happy without either of them. Only,\u201d she thought, \u201cto tell Prince Andrew what has happened or to hide it from him are both equally impossible. But with that one nothing is spoiled. But am I really to abandon forever the joy of Prince Andrew\u2019s love, in which I have lived so long?\u201d\n\n\u201cPlease, Miss!\u201d whispered a maid entering the room with a mysterious air. \u201cA man told me to give you this\u2014\u201d and she handed Nat\u00e1sha a letter.\n\n\u201cOnly, for Christ\u2019s sake...\u201d the girl went on, as Nat\u00e1sha, without thinking, mechanically broke the seal and read a love letter from Anatole, of which, without taking in a word, she understood only that it was a letter from him\u2014from the man she loved. Yes, she loved him, or else how could that have happened which had happened? And how could she have a love letter from him in her hand?\n\nWith trembling hands Nat\u00e1sha held that passionate love letter which D\u00f3lokhov had composed for Anatole, and as she read it she found in it an echo of all that she herself imagined she was feeling.\n\n\u201cSince yesterday evening my fate has been sealed; to be loved by you or to die. There is no other way for me,\u201d the letter began. Then he went on to say that he knew her parents would not give her to him\u2014for this there were secret reasons he could reveal only to her\u2014but that if she loved him she need only say the word yes, and no human power could hinder their bliss. Love would conquer all. He would steal her away and carry her off to the ends of the earth.\n\n\u201cYes, yes! I love him!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha, reading the letter for the twentieth time and finding some peculiarly deep meaning in each word of it.\n\nThat evening M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna was going to the Akh\u00e1rovs\u2019 and proposed to take the girls with her. Nat\u00e1sha, pleading a headache, remained at home.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOn returning late in the evening S\u00f3nya went to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s room, and to her surprise found her still dressed and asleep on the sofa. Open on the table, beside her lay Anatole\u2019s letter. S\u00f3nya picked it up and read it.\n\nAs she read she glanced at the sleeping Nat\u00e1sha, trying to find in her face an explanation of what she was reading, but did not find it. Her face was calm, gentle, and happy. Clutching her breast to keep herself from choking, S\u00f3nya, pale and trembling with fear and agitation, sat down in an armchair and burst into tears.\n\n\u201cHow was it I noticed nothing? How could it go so far? Can she have left off loving Prince Andrew? And how could she let Kur\u00e1gin go to such lengths? He is a deceiver and a villain, that\u2019s plain! What will Nicholas, dear noble Nicholas, do when he hears of it? So this is the meaning of her excited, resolute, unnatural look the day before yesterday, yesterday, and today,\u201d thought S\u00f3nya. \u201cBut it can\u2019t be that she loves him! She probably opened the letter without knowing who it was from. Probably she is offended by it. She could not do such a thing!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya wiped away her tears and went up to Nat\u00e1sha, again scanning her face.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha!\u201d she said, just audibly.\n\nNat\u00e1sha awoke and saw S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cAh, you\u2019re back?\u201d\n\nAnd with the decision and tenderness that often come at the moment of awakening, she embraced her friend, but noticing S\u00f3nya\u2019s look of embarrassment, her own face expressed confusion and suspicion.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, you\u2019ve read that letter?\u201d she demanded.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d answered S\u00f3nya softly.\n\nNat\u00e1sha smiled rapturously.\n\n\u201cNo, S\u00f3nya, I can\u2019t any longer!\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t hide it from you any longer. You know, we love one another! S\u00f3nya, darling, he writes... S\u00f3nya...\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya stared open-eyed at Nat\u00e1sha, unable to believe her ears.\n\n\u201cAnd Bolk\u00f3nski?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cAh, S\u00f3nya, if you only knew how happy I am!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what love is....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Nat\u00e1sha, can that be all over?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at S\u00f3nya with wide-open eyes as if she could not grasp the question.\n\n\u201cWell, then, are you refusing Prince Andrew?\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cOh, you don\u2019t understand anything! Don\u2019t talk nonsense, just listen!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, with momentary vexation.\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d insisted S\u00f3nya. \u201cI don\u2019t understand. How is it you have loved a man for a whole year and suddenly... Why, you have only seen him three times! Nat\u00e1sha, I don\u2019t believe you, you\u2019re joking! In three days to forget everything and so...\u201d\n\n\u201cThree days?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cIt seems to me I\u2019ve loved him a hundred years. It seems to me that I have never loved anyone before. You can\u2019t understand it.... S\u00f3nya, wait a bit, sit here,\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha embraced and kissed her.\n\n\u201cI had heard that it happens like this, and you must have heard it too, but it\u2019s only now that I feel such love. It\u2019s not the same as before. As soon as I saw him I felt he was my master and I his slave, and that I could not help loving him. Yes, his slave! Whatever he orders I shall do. You don\u2019t understand that. What can I do? What can I do, S\u00f3nya?\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha with a happy yet frightened expression.\n\n\u201cBut think what you are doing,\u201d cried S\u00f3nya. \u201cI can\u2019t leave it like this. This secret correspondence... How could you let him go so far?\u201d she went on, with a horror and disgust she could hardly conceal.\n\n\u201cI told you that I have no will,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha replied. \u201cWhy can\u2019t you understand? I love him!\u201d\n\n\u201cThen I won\u2019t let it come to that... I shall tell!\u201d cried S\u00f3nya, bursting into tears.\n\n\u201cWhat do you mean? For God\u2019s sake... If you tell, you are my enemy!\u201d declared Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou want me to be miserable, you want us to be separated....\u201d\n\nWhen she saw Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s fright, S\u00f3nya shed tears of shame and pity for her friend.\n\n\u201cBut what has happened between you?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhat has he said to you? Why doesn\u2019t he come to the house?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not answer her questions.\n\n\u201cFor God\u2019s sake, S\u00f3nya, don\u2019t tell anyone, don\u2019t torture me,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha entreated. \u201cRemember no one ought to interfere in such matters! I have confided in you....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why this secrecy? Why doesn\u2019t he come to the house?\u201d asked S\u00f3nya. \u201cWhy doesn\u2019t he openly ask for your hand? You know Prince Andrew gave you complete freedom\u2014if it is really so; but I don\u2019t believe it! Nat\u00e1sha, have you considered what these secret reasons can be?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at S\u00f3nya with astonishment. Evidently this question presented itself to her mind for the first time and she did not know how to answer it.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the reasons are. But there must be reasons!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya sighed and shook her head incredulously.\n\n\u201cIf there were reasons...\u201d she began.\n\nBut Nat\u00e1sha, guessing her doubts, interrupted her in alarm.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, one can\u2019t doubt him! One can\u2019t, one can\u2019t! Don\u2019t you understand?\u201d she cried.\n\n\u201cDoes he love you?\u201d\n\n\u201cDoes he love me?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha repeated with a smile of pity at her friend\u2019s lack of comprehension. \u201cWhy, you have read his letter and you have seen him.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if he is dishonorable?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe! dishonorable? If you only knew!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cIf he is an honorable man he should either declare his intentions or cease seeing you; and if you won\u2019t do this, I will. I will write to him, and I will tell Papa!\u201d said S\u00f3nya resolutely.\n\n\u201cBut I can\u2019t live without him!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, I don\u2019t understand you. And what are you saying! Think of your father and of Nicholas.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want anyone, I don\u2019t love anyone but him. How dare you say he is dishonorable? Don\u2019t you know that I love him?\u201d screamed Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cGo away, S\u00f3nya! I don\u2019t want to quarrel with you, but go, for God\u2019s sake go! You see how I am suffering!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha cried angrily, in a voice of despair and repressed irritation. S\u00f3nya burst into sobs and ran from the room.\n\nNat\u00e1sha went to the table and without a moment\u2019s reflection wrote that answer to Princess Mary which she had been unable to write all the morning. In this letter she said briefly that all their misunderstandings were at an end; that availing herself of the magnanimity of Prince Andrew who when he went abroad had given her her freedom, she begged Princess Mary to forget everything and forgive her if she had been to blame toward her, but that she could not be his wife. At that moment this all seemed quite easy, simple, and clear to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\nOn Friday the Rost\u00f3vs were to return to the country, but on Wednesday the count went with the prospective purchaser to his estate near Moscow.\n\nOn the day the count left, S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha were invited to a big dinner party at the Kar\u00e1gins\u2019, and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna took them there. At that party Nat\u00e1sha again met Anatole, and S\u00f3nya noticed that she spoke to him, trying not to be overheard, and that all through dinner she was more agitated than ever. When they got home Nat\u00e1sha was the first to begin the explanation S\u00f3nya expected.\n\n\u201cThere, S\u00f3nya, you were talking all sorts of nonsense about him,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began in a mild voice such as children use when they wish to be praised. \u201cWe have had an explanation today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what happened? What did he say? Nat\u00e1sha, how glad I am you\u2019re not angry with me! Tell me everything\u2014the whole truth. What did he say?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha became thoughtful.\n\n\u201cOh, S\u00f3nya, if you knew him as I do! He said... He asked me what I had promised Bolk\u00f3nski. He was glad I was free to refuse him.\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya sighed sorrowfully.\n\n\u201cBut you haven\u2019t refused Bolk\u00f3nski?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cPerhaps I have. Perhaps all is over between me and Bolk\u00f3nski. Why do you think so badly of me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think anything, only I don\u2019t understand this...\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a bit, S\u00f3nya, you\u2019ll understand everything. You\u2019ll see what a man he is! Now don\u2019t think badly of me or of him. I don\u2019t think badly of anyone: I love and pity everybody. But what am I to do?\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya did not succumb to the tender tone Nat\u00e1sha used toward her. The more emotional and ingratiating the expression of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face became, the more serious and stern grew S\u00f3nya\u2019s.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha,\u201d said she, \u201cyou asked me not to speak to you, and I haven\u2019t spoken, but now you yourself have begun. I don\u2019t trust him, Nat\u00e1sha. Why this secrecy?\u201d\n\n\u201cAgain, again!\u201d interrupted Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, I am afraid for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cAfraid of what?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am afraid you\u2019re going to your ruin,\u201d said S\u00f3nya resolutely, and was herself horrified at what she had said.\n\nAnger again showed in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019ll go to my ruin, I will, as soon as possible! It\u2019s not your business! It won\u2019t be you, but I, who\u2019ll suffer. Leave me alone, leave me alone! I hate you!\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha!\u201d moaned S\u00f3nya, aghast.\n\n\u201cI hate you, I hate you! You\u2019re my enemy forever!\u201d And Nat\u00e1sha ran out of the room.\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not speak to S\u00f3nya again and avoided her. With the same expression of agitated surprise and guilt she went about the house, taking up now one occupation, now another, and at once abandoning them.\n\nHard as it was for S\u00f3nya, she watched her friend and did not let her out of her sight.\n\nThe day before the count was to return, S\u00f3nya noticed that Nat\u00e1sha sat by the drawing room window all the morning as if expecting something and that she made a sign to an officer who drove past, whom S\u00f3nya took to be Anatole.\n\nS\u00f3nya began watching her friend still more attentively and noticed that at dinner and all that evening Nat\u00e1sha was in a strange and unnatural state. She answered questions at random, began sentences she did not finish, and laughed at everything.\n\nAfter tea S\u00f3nya noticed a housemaid at Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s door timidly waiting to let her pass. She let the girl go in, and then listening at the door learned that another letter had been delivered.\n\nThen suddenly it became clear to S\u00f3nya that Nat\u00e1sha had some dreadful plan for that evening. S\u00f3nya knocked at her door. Nat\u00e1sha did not let her in.\n\n\u201cShe will run away with him!\u201d thought S\u00f3nya. \u201cShe is capable of anything. There was something particularly pathetic and resolute in her face today. She cried as she said good-by to Uncle,\u201d S\u00f3nya remembered. \u201cYes, that\u2019s it, she means to elope with him, but what am I to do?\u201d thought she, recalling all the signs that clearly indicated that Nat\u00e1sha had some terrible intention. \u201cThe count is away. What am I to do? Write to Kur\u00e1gin demanding an explanation? But what is there to oblige him to reply? Write to Pierre, as Prince Andrew asked me to in case of some misfortune?... But perhaps she really has already refused Bolk\u00f3nski\u2014she sent a letter to Princess Mary yesterday. And Uncle is away....\u201d To tell M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna who had such faith in Nat\u00e1sha seemed to S\u00f3nya terrible. \u201cWell, anyway,\u201d thought S\u00f3nya as she stood in the dark passage, \u201cnow or never I must prove that I remember the family\u2019s goodness to me and that I love Nicholas. Yes! If I don\u2019t sleep for three nights I\u2019ll not leave this passage and will hold her back by force and will and not let the family be disgraced,\u201d thought she.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAnatole had lately moved to D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s. The plan for Natalie Rost\u00f3va\u2019s abduction had been arranged and the preparations made by D\u00f3lokhov a few days before, and on the day that S\u00f3nya, after listening at Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s door, resolved to safeguard her, it was to have been put into execution. Nat\u00e1sha had promised to come out to Kur\u00e1gin at the back porch at ten that evening. Kur\u00e1gin was to put her into a troyka he would have ready and to drive her forty miles to the village of K\u00e1menka, where an unfrocked priest was in readiness to perform a marriage ceremony over them. At K\u00e1menka a relay of horses was to wait which would take them to the Warsaw highroad, and from there they would hasten abroad with post horses.\n\nAnatole had a passport, an order for post horses, ten thousand rubles he had taken from his sister and another ten thousand borrowed with D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s help.\n\nTwo witnesses for the mock marriage\u2014Khv\u00f3stikov, a retired petty official whom D\u00f3lokhov made use of in his gambling transactions, and Mak\u00e1rin, a retired hussar, a kindly, weak fellow who had an unbounded affection for Kur\u00e1gin\u2014were sitting at tea in D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s front room.\n\nIn his large study, the walls of which were hung to the ceiling with Persian rugs, bearskins, and weapons, sat D\u00f3lokhov in a traveling cloak and high boots, at an open desk on which lay an abacus and some bundles of paper money. Anatole, with uniform unbuttoned, walked to and fro from the room where the witnesses were sitting, through the study to the room behind, where his French valet and others were packing the last of his things. D\u00f3lokhov was counting the money and noting something down.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he said, \u201cKhv\u00f3stikov must have two thousand.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to him, then,\u201d said Anatole.\n\n\u201cMak\u00e1rka\u201d (their name for Mak\u00e1rin) \u201cwill go through fire and water for you for nothing. So here are our accounts all settled,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, showing him the memorandum. \u201cIs that right?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, of course,\u201d returned Anatole, evidently not listening to D\u00f3lokhov and looking straight before him with a smile that did not leave his face.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov banged down the lid of his desk and turned to Anatole with an ironic smile:\n\n\u201cDo you know? You\u2019d really better drop it all. There\u2019s still time!\u201d\n\n\u201cFool,\u201d retorted Anatole. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense! If you only knew... it\u2019s the devil knows what!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, really, give it up!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cI am speaking seriously. It\u2019s no joke, this plot you\u2019ve hatched.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat, teasing again? Go to the devil! Eh?\u201d said Anatole, making a grimace. \u201cReally it\u2019s no time for your stupid jokes,\u201d and he left the room.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov smiled contemptuously and condescendingly when Anatole had gone out.\n\n\u201cYou wait a bit,\u201d he called after him. \u201cI\u2019m not joking, I\u2019m talking sense. Come here, come here!\u201d\n\nAnatole returned and looked at D\u00f3lokhov, trying to give him his attention and evidently submitting to him involuntarily.\n\n\u201cNow listen to me. I\u2019m telling you this for the last time. Why should I joke about it? Did I hinder you? Who arranged everything for you? Who found the priest and got the passport? Who raised the money? I did it all.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, thank you for it. Do you think I am not grateful?\u201d And Anatole sighed and embraced D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cI helped you, but all the same I must tell you the truth; it is a dangerous business, and if you think about it\u2014a stupid business. Well, you\u2019ll carry her off\u2014all right! Will they let it stop at that? It will come out that you\u2019re already married. Why, they\u2019ll have you in the criminal court....\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, nonsense, nonsense!\u201d Anatole ejaculated and again made a grimace. \u201cDidn\u2019t I explain to you? What?\u201d And Anatole, with the partiality dull-witted people have for any conclusion they have reached by their own reasoning, repeated the argument he had already put to D\u00f3lokhov a hundred times. \u201cDidn\u2019t I explain to you that I have come to this conclusion: if this marriage is invalid,\u201d he went on, crooking one finger, \u201cthen I have nothing to answer for; but if it is valid, no matter! Abroad no one will know anything about it. Isn\u2019t that so? And don\u2019t talk to me, don\u2019t, don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeriously, you\u2019d better drop it! You\u2019ll only get yourself into a mess!\u201d\n\n\u201cGo to the devil!\u201d cried Anatole and, clutching his hair, left the room, but returned at once and dropped into an armchair in front of D\u00f3lokhov with his feet turned under him. \u201cIt\u2019s the very devil! What? Feel how it beats!\u201d He took D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s hand and put it on his heart. \u201cWhat a foot, my dear fellow! What a glance! A goddess!\u201d he added in French. \u201cWhat?\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov with a cold smile and a gleam in his handsome insolent eyes looked at him\u2014evidently wishing to get some more amusement out of him.\n\n\u201cWell and when the money\u2019s gone, what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat then? Eh?\u201d repeated Anatole, sincerely perplexed by a thought of the future. \u201cWhat then?... Then, I don\u2019t know.... But why talk nonsense!\u201d He glanced at his watch. \u201cIt\u2019s time!\u201d\n\nAnatole went into the back room.\n\n\u201cNow then! Nearly ready? You\u2019re dawdling!\u201d he shouted to the servants.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov put away the money, called a footman whom he ordered to bring something for them to eat and drink before the journey, and went into the room where Khv\u00f3stikov and Mak\u00e1rin were sitting.\n\nAnatole lay on the sofa in the study leaning on his elbow and smiling pensively, while his handsome lips muttered tenderly to himself.\n\n\u201cCome and eat something. Have a drink!\u201d D\u00f3lokhov shouted to him from the other room.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to,\u201d answered Anatole continuing to smile.\n\n\u201cCome! Balag\u00e1 is here.\u201d\n\nAnatole rose and went into the dining room. Balag\u00e1 was a famous troyka driver who had known D\u00f3lokhov and Anatole some six years and had given them good service with his troykas. More than once when Anatole\u2019s regiment was stationed at Tver he had taken him from Tver in the evening, brought him to Moscow by daybreak, and driven him back again the next night. More than once he had enabled D\u00f3lokhov to escape when pursued. More than once he had driven them through the town with gypsies and \u201cladykins\u201d as he called the cocottes. More than once in their service he had run over pedestrians and upset vehicles in the streets of Moscow and had always been protected from the consequences by \u201cmy gentlemen\u201d as he called them. He had ruined more than one horse in their service. More than once they had beaten him, and more than once they had made him drunk on champagne and Madeira, which he loved; and he knew more than one thing about each of them which would long ago have sent an ordinary man to Siberia. They often called Balag\u00e1 into their orgies and made him drink and dance at the gypsies\u2019, and more than one thousand rubles of their money had passed through his hands. In their service he risked his skin and his life twenty times a year, and in their service had lost more horses than the money he had from them would buy. But he liked them; liked that mad driving at twelve miles an hour, liked upsetting a driver or running down a pedestrian, and flying at full gallop through the Moscow streets. He liked to hear those wild, tipsy shouts behind him: \u201cGet on! Get on!\u201d when it was impossible to go any faster. He liked giving a painful lash on the neck to some peasant who, more dead than alive, was already hurrying out of his way. \u201cReal gentlemen!\u201d he considered them.\n\nAnatole and D\u00f3lokhov liked Balag\u00e1 too for his masterly driving and because he liked the things they liked. With others Balag\u00e1 bargained, charging twenty-five rubles for a two hours\u2019 drive, and rarely drove himself, generally letting his young men do so. But with \u201chis gentlemen\u201d he always drove himself and never demanded anything for his work. Only a couple of times a year\u2014when he knew from their valets that they had money in hand\u2014he would turn up of a morning quite sober and with a deep bow would ask them to help him. The gentlemen always made him sit down.\n\n\u201cDo help me out, Theodore Iv\u00e1nych, sir,\u201d or \u201cyour excellency,\u201d he would say. \u201cI am quite out of horses. Let me have what you can to go to the fair.\u201d\n\nAnd Anatole and D\u00f3lokhov, when they had money, would give him a thousand or a couple of thousand rubles.\n\nBalag\u00e1 was a fair-haired, short, and snub-nosed peasant of about twenty-seven; red-faced, with a particularly red thick neck, glittering little eyes, and a small beard. He wore a fine, dark-blue, silk-lined cloth coat over a sheepskin.\n\nOn entering the room now he crossed himself, turning toward the front corner of the room, and went up to D\u00f3lokhov, holding out a small, black hand.\n\n\u201cTheodore Iv\u00e1nych!\u201d he said, bowing.\n\n\u201cHow d\u2019you do, friend? Well, here he is!\u201d\n\n\u201cGood day, your excellency!\u201d he said, again holding out his hand to Anatole who had just come in.\n\n\u201cI say, Balag\u00e1,\u201d said Anatole, putting his hands on the man\u2019s shoulders, \u201cdo you care for me or not? Eh? Now, do me a service.... What horses have you come with? Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs your messenger ordered, your special beasts,\u201d replied Balag\u00e1.\n\n\u201cWell, listen, Balag\u00e1! Drive all three to death but get me there in three hours. Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen they are dead, what shall I drive?\u201d said Balag\u00e1 with a wink.\n\n\u201cMind, I\u2019ll smash your face in! Don\u2019t make jokes!\u201d cried Anatole, suddenly rolling his eyes.\n\n\u201cWhy joke?\u201d said the driver, laughing. \u201cAs if I\u2019d grudge my gentlemen anything! As fast as ever the horses can gallop, so fast we\u2019ll go!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Anatole. \u201cWell, sit down.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, sit down!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand, Theodore Iv\u00e1nych.\u201d\n\n\u201cSit down; nonsense! Have a drink!\u201d said Anatole, and filled a large glass of Madeira for him.\n\nThe driver\u2019s eyes sparkled at the sight of the wine. After refusing it for manners\u2019 sake, he drank it and wiped his mouth with a red silk handkerchief he took out of his cap.\n\n\u201cAnd when are we to start, your excellency?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell...\u201d Anatole looked at his watch. \u201cWe\u2019ll start at once. Mind, Balag\u00e1! You\u2019ll get there in time? Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat depends on our luck in starting, else why shouldn\u2019t we be there in time?\u201d replied Balag\u00e1. \u201cDidn\u2019t we get you to Tver in seven hours? I think you remember that, your excellency?\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, one Christmas I drove from Tver,\u201d said Anatole, smilingly at the recollection and turning to Mak\u00e1rin who gazed rapturously at him with wide-open eyes. \u201cWill you believe it, Mak\u00e1rka, it took one\u2019s breath away, the rate we flew. We came across a train of loaded sleighs and drove right over two of them. Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cThose were horses!\u201d Balag\u00e1 continued the tale. \u201cThat time I\u2019d harnessed two young side horses with the bay in the shafts,\u201d he went on, turning to D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cWill you believe it, Theodore Iv\u00e1nych, those animals flew forty miles? I couldn\u2019t hold them in, my hands grew numb in the sharp frost so that I threw down the reins\u2014\u2018Catch hold yourself, your excellency!\u2019 says I, and I just tumbled on the bottom of the sleigh and sprawled there. It wasn\u2019t a case of urging them on, there was no holding them in till we reached the place. The devils took us there in three hours! Only the near one died of it.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAnatole went out of the room and returned a few minutes later wearing a fur coat girt with a silver belt, and a sable cap jauntily set on one side and very becoming to his handsome face. Having looked in a mirror, and standing before D\u00f3lokhov in the same pose he had assumed before it, he lifted a glass of wine.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by, Theodore. Thank you for everything and farewell!\u201d said Anatole. \u201cWell, comrades and friends...\u201d he considered for a moment \u201c... of my youth, farewell!\u201d he said, turning to Mak\u00e1rin and the others.\n\nThough they were all going with him, Anatole evidently wished to make something touching and solemn out of this address to his comrades. He spoke slowly in a loud voice and throwing out his chest slightly swayed one leg.\n\n\u201cAll take glasses; you too, Balag\u00e1. Well, comrades and friends of my youth, we\u2019ve had our fling and lived and reveled. Eh? And now, when shall we meet again? I am going abroad. We have had a good time\u2014now farewell, lads! To our health! Hurrah!...\u201d he cried, and emptying his glass flung it on the floor.\n\n\u201cTo your health!\u201d said Balag\u00e1 who also emptied his glass, and wiped his mouth with his handkerchief.\n\nMak\u00e1rin embraced Anatole with tears in his eyes.\n\n\u201cAh, Prince, how sorry I am to part from you!\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s go. Let\u2019s go!\u201d cried Anatole.\n\nBalag\u00e1 was about to leave the room.\n\n\u201cNo, stop!\u201d said Anatole. \u201cShut the door; we have first to sit down. That\u2019s the way.\u201d\n\nThey shut the door and all sat down.\n\n\u201cNow, quick march, lads!\u201d said Anatole, rising.\n\nJoseph, his valet, handed him his sabretache and saber, and they all went out into the vestibule.\n\n\u201cAnd where\u2019s the fur cloak?\u201d asked D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cHey, Ign\u00e1tka! Go to Matr\u00ebna Matr\u00e9vna and ask her for the sable cloak. I have heard what elopements are like,\u201d continued D\u00f3lokhov with a wink. \u201cWhy, she\u2019ll rush out more dead than alive just in the things she is wearing; if you delay at all there\u2019ll be tears and \u2018Papa\u2019 and \u2018Mamma,\u2019 and she\u2019s frozen in a minute and must go back\u2014but you wrap the fur cloak round her first thing and carry her to the sleigh.\u201d\n\nThe valet brought a woman\u2019s fox-lined cloak.\n\n\u201cFool, I told you the sable one! Hey, Matr\u00ebna, the sable!\u201d he shouted so that his voice rang far through the rooms.\n\nA handsome, slim, and pale-faced gypsy girl with glittering black eyes and curly blue-black hair, wearing a red shawl, ran out with a sable mantle on her arm.\n\n\u201cHere, I don\u2019t grudge it\u2014take it!\u201d she said, evidently afraid of her master and yet regretful of her cloak.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov, without answering, took the cloak, threw it over Matr\u00ebna, and wrapped her up in it.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the way,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov, \u201cand then so!\u201d and he turned the collar up round her head, leaving only a little of the face uncovered. \u201cAnd then so, do you see?\u201d and he pushed Anatole\u2019s head forward to meet the gap left by the collar, through which Matr\u00ebna\u2019s brilliant smile was seen.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by, Matr\u00ebna,\u201d said Anatole, kissing her. \u201cAh, my revels here are over. Remember me to St\u00ebshka. There, good-by! Good-by, Matr\u00ebna, wish me luck!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Prince, may God give you great luck!\u201d said Matr\u00ebna in her gypsy accent.\n\nTwo troykas were standing before the porch and two young drivers were holding the horses. Balag\u00e1 took his seat in the front one and holding his elbows high arranged the reins deliberately. Anatole and D\u00f3lokhov got in with him. Mak\u00e1rin, Khv\u00f3stikov, and a valet seated themselves in the other sleigh.\n\n\u201cWell, are you ready?\u201d asked Balag\u00e1.\n\n\u201cGo!\u201d he cried, twisting the reins round his hands, and the troyka tore down the Nik\u00edtski Boulevard.\n\n\u201cTproo! Get out of the way! Hi!... Tproo!...\u201d The shouting of Balag\u00e1 and of the sturdy young fellow seated on the box was all that could be heard. On the Arb\u00e1t Square the troyka caught against a carriage; something cracked, shouts were heard, and the troyka flew along the Arb\u00e1t Street.\n\nAfter taking a turn along the Podnov\u00ednski Boulevard, Balag\u00e1 began to rein in, and turning back drew up at the crossing of the old Kony\u00fasheny Street.\n\nThe young fellow on the box jumped down to hold the horses and Anatole and D\u00f3lokhov went along the pavement. When they reached the gate D\u00f3lokhov whistled. The whistle was answered, and a maidservant ran out.\n\n\u201cCome into the courtyard or you\u2019ll be seen; she\u2019ll come out directly,\u201d said she.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov stayed by the gate. Anatole followed the maid into the courtyard, turned the corner, and ran up into the porch.\n\nHe was met by Gabriel, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s gigantic footman.\n\n\u201cCome to the mistress, please,\u201d said the footman in his deep bass, intercepting any retreat.\n\n\u201cTo what Mistress? Who are you?\u201d asked Anatole in a breathless whisper.\n\n\u201cKindly step in, my orders are to bring you in.\u201d\n\n\u201cKur\u00e1gin! Come back!\u201d shouted D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cBetrayed! Back!\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov, after Anatole entered, had remained at the wicket gate and was struggling with the yard porter who was trying to lock it. With a last desperate effort D\u00f3lokhov pushed the porter aside, and when Anatole ran back seized him by the arm, pulled him through the wicket, and ran back with him to the troyka.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, having found S\u00f3nya weeping in the corridor, made her confess everything, and intercepting the note to Nat\u00e1sha she read it and went into Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s room with it in her hand.\n\n\u201cYou shameless good-for-nothing!\u201d said she. \u201cI won\u2019t hear a word.\u201d\n\nPushing back Nat\u00e1sha who looked at her with astonished but tearless eyes, she locked her in; and having given orders to the yard porter to admit the persons who would be coming that evening, but not to let them out again, and having told the footman to bring them up to her, she seated herself in the drawing room to await the abductors.\n\nWhen Gabriel came to inform her that the men who had come had run away again, she rose frowning, and clasping her hands behind her paced through the rooms a long time considering what she should do. Toward midnight she went to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s room fingering the key in her pocket. S\u00f3nya was sitting sobbing in the corridor. \u201cM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, for God\u2019s sake let me in to her!\u201d she pleaded, but M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna unlocked the door and went in without giving her an answer.... \u201cDisgusting, abominable... In my house... horrid girl, hussy! I\u2019m only sorry for her father!\u201d thought she, trying to restrain her wrath. \u201cHard as it may be, I\u2019ll tell them all to hold their tongues and will hide it from the count.\u201d She entered the room with resolute steps. Nat\u00e1sha lying on the sofa, her head hidden in her hands, and she did not stir. She was in just the same position in which M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna had left her.\n\n\u201cA nice girl! Very nice!\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cArranging meetings with lovers in my house! It\u2019s no use pretending: you listen when I speak to you!\u201d And M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna touched her arm. \u201cListen when I speak! You\u2019ve disgraced yourself like the lowest of hussies. I\u2019d treat you differently, but I\u2019m sorry for your father, so I will conceal it.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not change her position, but her whole body heaved with noiseless, convulsive sobs which choked her. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna glanced round at S\u00f3nya and seated herself on the sofa beside Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s lucky for him that he escaped me; but I\u2019ll find him!\u201d she said in her rough voice. \u201cDo you hear what I am saying or not?\u201d she added.\n\nShe put her large hand under Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face and turned it toward her. Both M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna and S\u00f3nya were amazed when they saw how Nat\u00e1sha looked. Her eyes were dry and glistening, her lips compressed, her cheeks sunken.\n\n\u201cLet me be!... What is it to me?... I shall die!\u201d she muttered, wrenching herself from M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s hands with a vicious effort and sinking down again into her former position.\n\n\u201cNatalie!\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cI wish for your good. Lie still, stay like that then, I won\u2019t touch you. But listen. I won\u2019t tell you how guilty you are. You know that yourself. But when your father comes back tomorrow what am I to tell him? Eh?\u201d\n\nAgain Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s body shook with sobs.\n\n\u201cSuppose he finds out, and your brother, and your betrothed?\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no betrothed: I have refused him!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s all the same,\u201d continued M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cIf they hear of this, will they let it pass? He, your father, I know him... if he challenges him to a duel will that be all right? Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, let me be! Why have you interfered at all? Why? Why? Who asked you to?\u201d shouted Nat\u00e1sha, raising herself on the sofa and looking malignantly at M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\n\u201cBut what did you want?\u201d cried M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, growing angry again. \u201cWere you kept under lock and key? Who hindered his coming to the house? Why carry you off as if you were some gypsy singing girl?... Well, if he had carried you off... do you think they wouldn\u2019t have found him? Your father, or brother, or your betrothed? And he\u2019s a scoundrel, a wretch\u2014that\u2019s a fact!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is better than any of you!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha getting up. \u201cIf you hadn\u2019t interfered... Oh, my God! What is it all? What is it? S\u00f3nya, why?... Go away!\u201d\n\nAnd she burst into sobs with the despairing vehemence with which people bewail disasters they feel they have themselves occasioned. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna was to speak again but Nat\u00e1sha cried out:\n\n\u201cGo away! Go away! You all hate and despise me!\u201d and she threw herself back on the sofa.\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna went on admonishing her for some time, enjoining on her that it must all be kept from her father and assuring her that nobody would know anything about it if only Nat\u00e1sha herself would undertake to forget it all and not let anyone see that something had happened. Nat\u00e1sha did not reply, nor did she sob any longer, but she grew cold and had a shivering fit. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna put a pillow under her head, covered her with two quilts, and herself brought her some lime-flower water, but Nat\u00e1sha did not respond to her.\n\n\u201cWell, let her sleep,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna as she went out of the room supposing Nat\u00e1sha to be asleep.\n\nBut Nat\u00e1sha was not asleep; with pale face and fixed wide-open eyes she looked straight before her. All that night she did not sleep or weep and did not speak to S\u00f3nya who got up and went to her several times.\n\nNext day Count Rost\u00f3v returned from his estate near Moscow in time for lunch as he had promised. He was in very good spirits; the affair with the purchaser was going on satisfactorily, and there was nothing to keep him any longer in Moscow, away from the countess whom he missed. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna met him and told him that Nat\u00e1sha had been very unwell the day before and that they had sent for the doctor, but that she was better now. Nat\u00e1sha had not left her room that morning. With compressed and parched lips and dry fixed eyes, she sat at the window, uneasily watching the people who drove past and hurriedly glancing round at anyone who entered the room. She was evidently expecting news of him and that he would come or would write to her.\n\nWhen the count came to see her she turned anxiously round at the sound of a man\u2019s footstep, and then her face resumed its cold and malevolent expression. She did not even get up to greet him. \u201cWhat is the matter with you, my angel? Are you ill?\u201d asked the count.\n\nAfter a moment\u2019s silence Nat\u00e1sha answered: \u201cYes, ill.\u201d\n\nIn reply to the count\u2019s anxious inquiries as to why she was so dejected and whether anything had happened to her betrothed, she assured him that nothing had happened and asked him not to worry. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna confirmed Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s assurances that nothing had happened. From the pretense of illness, from his daughter\u2019s distress, and by the embarrassed faces of S\u00f3nya and M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, the count saw clearly that something had gone wrong during his absence, but it was so terrible for him to think that anything disgraceful had happened to his beloved daughter, and he so prized his own cheerful tranquillity, that he avoided inquiries and tried to assure himself that nothing particularly had happened; and he was only dissatisfied that her indisposition delayed their return to the country.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nFrom the day his wife arrived in Moscow Pierre had been intending to go away somewhere, so as not to be near her. Soon after the Rost\u00f3vs came to Moscow the effect Nat\u00e1sha had on him made him hasten to carry out his intention. He went to Tver to see Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s widow, who had long since promised to hand over to him some papers of her deceased husband\u2019s.\n\nWhen he returned to Moscow Pierre was handed a letter from M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna asking him to come and see her on a matter of great importance relating to Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski and his betrothed. Pierre had been avoiding Nat\u00e1sha because it seemed to him that his feeling for her was stronger than a married man\u2019s should be for his friend\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. Yet some fate constantly threw them together.\n\n\u201cWhat can have happened? And what can they want with me?\u201d thought he as he dressed to go to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s. \u201cIf only Prince Andrew would hurry up and come and marry her!\u201d thought he on his way to the house.\n\nOn the Tversk\u00f3y Boulevard a familiar voice called to him.\n\n\u201cPierre! Been back long?\u201d someone shouted. Pierre raised his head. In a sleigh drawn by two gray trotting-horses that were bespattering the dashboard with snow, Anatole and his constant companion Mak\u00e1rin dashed past. Anatole was sitting upright in the classic pose of military dandies, the lower part of his face hidden by his beaver collar and his head slightly bent. His face was fresh and rosy, his white-plumed hat, tilted to one side, disclosed his curled and pomaded hair besprinkled with powdery snow.\n\n\u201cYes, indeed, that\u2019s a true sage,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cHe sees nothing beyond the pleasure of the moment, nothing troubles him and so he is always cheerful, satisfied, and serene. What wouldn\u2019t I give to be like him!\u201d he thought enviously.\n\nIn M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s anteroom the footman who helped him off with his fur coat said that the mistress asked him to come to her bedroom.\n\nWhen he opened the ballroom door Pierre saw Nat\u00e1sha sitting at the window, with a thin, pale, and spiteful face. She glanced round at him, frowned, and left the room with an expression of cold dignity.\n\n\u201cWhat has happened?\u201d asked Pierre, entering M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cFine doings!\u201d answered Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cFor fifty-eight years have I lived in this world and never known anything so disgraceful!\u201d\n\nAnd having put him on his honor not to repeat anything she told him, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna informed him that Nat\u00e1sha had refused Prince Andrew without her parents\u2019 knowledge and that the cause of this was Anatole Kur\u00e1gin into whose society Pierre\u2019s wife had thrown her and with whom Nat\u00e1sha had tried to elope during her father\u2019s absence, in order to be married secretly.\n\nPierre raised his shoulders and listened open-mouthed to what was told him, scarcely able to believe his own ears. That Prince Andrew\u2019s deeply loved affianced wife\u2014the same Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va who used to be so charming\u2014should give up Bolk\u00f3nski for that fool Anatole who was already secretly married (as Pierre knew), and should be so in love with him as to agree to run away with him, was something Pierre could not conceive and could not imagine.\n\nHe could not reconcile the charming impression he had of Nat\u00e1sha, whom he had known from a child, with this new conception of her baseness, folly, and cruelty. He thought of his wife. \u201cThey are all alike!\u201d he said to himself, reflecting that he was not the only man unfortunate enough to be tied to a bad woman. But still he pitied Prince Andrew to the point of tears and sympathized with his wounded pride, and the more he pitied his friend the more did he think with contempt and even with disgust of that Nat\u00e1sha who had just passed him in the ballroom with such a look of cold dignity. He did not know that Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s soul was overflowing with despair, shame, and humiliation, and that it was not her fault that her face happened to assume an expression of calm dignity and severity.\n\n\u201cBut how get married?\u201d said Pierre, in answer to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cHe could not marry\u2014he is married!\u201d\n\n\u201cThings get worse from hour to hour!\u201d ejaculated M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna. \u201cA nice youth! What a scoundrel! And she\u2019s expecting him\u2014expecting him since yesterday. She must be told! Then at least she won\u2019t go on expecting him.\u201d\n\nAfter hearing the details of Anatole\u2019s marriage from Pierre, and giving vent to her anger against Anatole in words of abuse, M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna told Pierre why she had sent for him. She was afraid that the count or Bolk\u00f3nski, who might arrive at any moment, if they knew of this affair (which she hoped to hide from them) might challenge Anatole to a duel, and she therefore asked Pierre to tell his brother-in-law in her name to leave Moscow and not dare to let her set eyes on him again. Pierre\u2014only now realizing the danger to the old count, Nicholas, and Prince Andrew\u2014promised to do as she wished. Having briefly and exactly explained her wishes to him, she let him go to the drawing room.\n\n\u201cMind, the count knows nothing. Behave as if you know nothing either,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I will go and tell her it is no use expecting him! And stay to dinner if you care to!\u201d she called after Pierre.\n\nPierre met the old count, who seemed nervous and upset. That morning Nat\u00e1sha had told him that she had rejected Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\u201cTroubles, troubles, my dear fellow!\u201d he said to Pierre. \u201cWhat troubles one has with these girls without their mother! I do so regret having come here.... I will be frank with you. Have you heard she has broken off her engagement without consulting anybody? It\u2019s true this engagement never was much to my liking. Of course he is an excellent man, but still, with his father\u2019s disapproval they wouldn\u2019t have been happy, and Nat\u00e1sha won\u2019t lack suitors. Still, it has been going on so long, and to take such a step without father\u2019s or mother\u2019s consent! And now she\u2019s ill, and God knows what! It\u2019s hard, Count, hard to manage daughters in their mother\u2019s absence....\u201d\n\nPierre saw that the count was much upset and tried to change the subject, but the count returned to his troubles.\n\nS\u00f3nya entered the room with an agitated face.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha is not quite well; she\u2019s in her room and would like to see you. M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna is with her and she too asks you to come.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, you are a great friend of Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s, no doubt she wants to send him a message,\u201d said the count. \u201cOh dear! Oh dear! How happy it all was!\u201d\n\nAnd clutching the spare gray locks on his temples the count left the room.\n\nWhen M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna told Nat\u00e1sha that Anatole was married, Nat\u00e1sha did not wish to believe it and insisted on having it confirmed by Pierre himself. S\u00f3nya told Pierre this as she led him along the corridor to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s room.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, pale and stern, was sitting beside M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, and her eyes, glittering feverishly, met Pierre with a questioning look the moment he entered. She did not smile or nod, but only gazed fixedly at him, and her look asked only one thing: was he a friend, or like the others an enemy in regard to Anatole? As for Pierre, he evidently did not exist for her.\n\n\u201cHe knows all about it,\u201d said M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna pointing to Pierre and addressing Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cLet him tell you whether I have told the truth.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked from one to the other as a hunted and wounded animal looks at the approaching dogs and sportsmen.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1lya Ilyn\u00edchna,\u201d Pierre began, dropping his eyes with a feeling of pity for her and loathing for the thing he had to do, \u201cwhether it is true or not should make no difference to you, because...\u201d\n\n\u201cThen it is not true that he\u2019s married!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it is true.\u201d\n\n\u201cHas he been married long?\u201d she asked. \u201cOn your honor?...\u201d\n\nPierre gave his word of honor.\n\n\u201cIs he still here?\u201d she asked, quickly.\n\n\u201cYes, I have just seen him.\u201d\n\nShe was evidently unable to speak and made a sign with her hands that they should leave her alone.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nPierre did not stay for dinner, but left the room and went away at once. He drove through the town seeking Anatole Kur\u00e1gin, at the thought of whom now the blood rushed to his heart and he felt a difficulty in breathing. He was not at the ice hills, nor at the gypsies\u2019, nor at Komoneno\u2019s. Pierre drove to the Club. In the Club all was going on as usual. The members who were assembling for dinner were sitting about in groups; they greeted Pierre and spoke of the town news. The footman having greeted him, knowing his habits and his acquaintances, told him there was a place left for him in the small dining room and that Prince Michael Zakh\u00e1rych was in the library, but Paul Timof\u00e9evich had not yet arrived. One of Pierre\u2019s acquaintances, while they were talking about the weather, asked if he had heard of Kur\u00e1gin\u2019s abduction of Rost\u00f3va which was talked of in the town, and was it true? Pierre laughed and said it was nonsense for he had just come from the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019. He asked everyone about Anatole. One man told him he had not come yet, and another that he was coming to dinner. Pierre felt it strange to see this calm, indifferent crowd of people unaware of what was going on in his soul. He paced through the ballroom, waited till everyone had come, and as Anatole had not turned up did not stay for dinner but drove home.\n\nAnatole, for whom Pierre was looking, dined that day with D\u00f3lokhov, consulting him as to how to remedy this unfortunate affair. It seemed to him essential to see Nat\u00e1sha. In the evening he drove to his sister\u2019s to discuss with her how to arrange a meeting. When Pierre returned home after vainly hunting all over Moscow, his valet informed him that Prince Anatole was with the countess. The countess\u2019 drawing room was full of guests.\n\nPierre without greeting his wife whom he had not seen since his return\u2014at that moment she was more repulsive to him than ever\u2014entered the drawing room and seeing Anatole went up to him.\n\n\u201cAh, Pierre,\u201d said the countess going up to her husband. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what a plight our Anatole...\u201d\n\nShe stopped, seeing in the forward thrust of her husband\u2019s head, in his glowing eyes and his resolute gait, the terrible indications of that rage and strength which she knew and had herself experienced after his duel with D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cWhere you are, there is vice and evil!\u201d said Pierre to his wife. \u201cAnatole, come with me! I must speak to you,\u201d he added in French.\n\nAnatole glanced round at his sister and rose submissively, ready to follow Pierre. Pierre, taking him by the arm, pulled him toward himself and was leading him from the room.\n\n\u201cIf you allow yourself in my drawing room...\u201d whispered H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, but Pierre did not reply and went out of the room.\n\nAnatole followed him with his usual jaunty step but his face betrayed anxiety.\n\nHaving entered his study Pierre closed the door and addressed Anatole without looking at him.\n\n\u201cYou promised Countess Rost\u00f3va to marry her and were about to elope with her, is that so?\u201d\n\n\u201cMon cher,\u201d answered Anatole (their whole conversation was in French), \u201cI don\u2019t consider myself bound to answer questions put to me in that tone.\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s face, already pale, became distorted by fury. He seized Anatole by the collar of his uniform with his big hand and shook him from side to side till Anatole\u2019s face showed a sufficient degree of terror.\n\n\u201cWhen I tell you that I must talk to you!...\u201d repeated Pierre.\n\n\u201cCome now, this is stupid. What?\u201d said Anatole, fingering a button of his collar that had been wrenched loose with a bit of the cloth.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a scoundrel and a blackguard, and I don\u2019t know what deprives me from the pleasure of smashing your head with this!\u201d said Pierre, expressing himself so artificially because he was talking French.\n\nHe took a heavy paperweight and lifted it threateningly, but at once put it back in its place.\n\n\u201cDid you promise to marry her?\u201d\n\n\u201cI... I didn\u2019t think of it. I never promised, because...\u201d\n\nPierre interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHave you any letters of hers? Any letters?\u201d he said, moving toward Anatole.\n\nAnatole glanced at him and immediately thrust his hand into his pocket and drew out his pocketbook.\n\nPierre took the letter Anatole handed him and, pushing aside a table that stood in his way, threw himself on the sofa.\n\n\u201cI shan\u2019t be violent, don\u2019t be afraid!\u201d said Pierre in answer to a frightened gesture of Anatole\u2019s. \u201cFirst, the letters,\u201d said he, as if repeating a lesson to himself. \u201cSecondly,\u201d he continued after a short pause, again rising and again pacing the room, \u201ctomorrow you must get out of Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how can I?...\u201d\n\n\u201cThirdly,\u201d Pierre continued without listening to him, \u201cyou must never breathe a word of what has passed between you and Countess Rost\u00f3va. I know I can\u2019t prevent your doing so, but if you have a spark of conscience...\u201d Pierre paced the room several times in silence.\n\nAnatole sat at a table frowning and biting his lips.\n\n\u201cAfter all, you must understand that besides your pleasure there is such a thing as other people\u2019s happiness and peace, and that you are ruining a whole life for the sake of amusing yourself! Amuse yourself with women like my wife\u2014with them you are within your rights, for they know what you want of them. They are armed against you by the same experience of debauchery; but to promise a maid to marry her... to deceive, to kidnap.... Don\u2019t you understand that it is as mean as beating an old man or a child?...\u201d\n\nPierre paused and looked at Anatole no longer with an angry but with a questioning look.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know about that, eh?\u201d said Anatole, growing more confident as Pierre mastered his wrath. \u201cI don\u2019t know that and don\u2019t want to,\u201d he said, not looking at Pierre and with a slight tremor of his lower jaw, \u201cbut you have used such words to me\u2014\u2018mean\u2019 and so on\u2014which as a man of honor I can\u2019t allow anyone to use.\u201d\n\nPierre glanced at him with amazement, unable to understand what he wanted.\n\n\u201cThough it was t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate,\u201d Anatole continued, \u201cstill I can\u2019t...\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it satisfaction you want?\u201d said Pierre ironically.\n\n\u201cYou could at least take back your words. What? If you want me to do as you wish, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cI take them back, I take them back!\u201d said Pierre, \u201cand I ask you to forgive me.\u201d Pierre involuntarily glanced at the loose button. \u201cAnd if you require money for your journey...\u201d\n\nAnatole smiled. The expression of that base and cringing smile, which Pierre knew so well in his wife, revolted him.\n\n\u201cOh, vile and heartless brood!\u201d he exclaimed, and left the room.\n\nNext day Anatole left for Petersburg.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre drove to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s to tell her of the fulfillment of her wish that Kur\u00e1gin should be banished from Moscow. The whole house was in a state of alarm and commotion. Nat\u00e1sha was very ill, having, as M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna told him in secret, poisoned herself the night after she had been told that Anatole was married, with some arsenic she had stealthily procured. After swallowing a little she had been so frightened that she woke S\u00f3nya and told her what she had done. The necessary antidotes had been administered in time and she was now out of danger, though still so weak that it was out of the question to move her to the country, and so the countess had been sent for. Pierre saw the distracted count, and S\u00f3nya, who had a tear-stained face, but he could not see Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nPierre dined at the club that day and heard on all sides gossip about the attempted abduction of Rost\u00f3va. He resolutely denied these rumors, assuring everyone that nothing had happened except that his brother-in-law had proposed to her and been refused. It seemed to Pierre that it was his duty to conceal the whole affair and re-establish Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s reputation.\n\nHe was awaiting Prince Andrew\u2019s return with dread and went every day to the old prince\u2019s for news of him.\n\nOld Prince Bolk\u00f3nski heard all the rumors current in the town from Mademoiselle Bourienne and had read the note to Princess Mary in which Nat\u00e1sha had broken off her engagement. He seemed in better spirits than usual and awaited his son with great impatience.\n\nSome days after Anatole\u2019s departure Pierre received a note from Prince Andrew, informing him of his arrival and asking him to come to see him.\n\nAs soon as he reached Moscow, Prince Andrew had received from his father Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s note to Princess Mary breaking off her engagement (Mademoiselle Bourienne had purloined it from Princess Mary and given it to the old prince), and he heard from him the story of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s elopement, with additions.\n\nPrince Andrew had arrived in the evening and Pierre came to see him next morning. Pierre expected to find Prince Andrew in almost the same state as Nat\u00e1sha and was therefore surprised on entering the drawing room to hear him in the study talking in a loud animated voice about some intrigue going on in Petersburg. The old prince\u2019s voice and another now and then interrupted him. Princess Mary came out to meet Pierre. She sighed, looking toward the door of the room where Prince Andrew was, evidently intending to express her sympathy with his sorrow, but Pierre saw by her face that she was glad both at what had happened and at the way her brother had taken the news of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s faithlessness.\n\n\u201cHe says he expected it,\u201d she remarked. \u201cI know his pride will not let him express his feelings, but still he has taken it better, far better, than I expected. Evidently it had to be....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut is it possible that all is really ended?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with astonishment. She did not understand how he could ask such a question. Pierre went into the study. Prince Andrew, greatly changed and plainly in better health, but with a fresh horizontal wrinkle between his brows, stood in civilian dress facing his father and Prince Meshch\u00e9rski, warmly disputing and vigorously gesticulating. The conversation was about Sper\u00e1nski\u2014the news of whose sudden exile and alleged treachery had just reached Moscow.\n\n\u201cNow he is censured and accused by all who were enthusiastic about him a month ago,\u201d Prince Andrew was saying, \u201cand by those who were unable to understand his aims. To judge a man who is in disfavor and to throw on him all the blame of other men\u2019s mistakes is very easy, but I maintain that if anything good has been accomplished in this reign it was done by him, by him alone.\u201d\n\nHe paused at the sight of Pierre. His face quivered and immediately assumed a vindictive expression.\n\n\u201cPosterity will do him justice,\u201d he concluded, and at once turned to Pierre.\n\n\u201cWell, how are you? Still getting stouter?\u201d he said with animation, but the new wrinkle on his forehead deepened. \u201cYes, I am well,\u201d he said in answer to Pierre\u2019s question, and smiled.\n\nTo Pierre that smile said plainly: \u201cI am well, but my health is now of no use to anyone.\u201d\n\nAfter a few words to Pierre about the awful roads from the Polish frontier, about people he had met in Switzerland who knew Pierre, and about M. Dessalles, whom he had brought from abroad to be his son\u2019s tutor, Prince Andrew again joined warmly in the conversation about Sper\u00e1nski which was still going on between the two old men.\n\n\u201cIf there were treason, or proofs of secret relations with Napoleon, they would have been made public,\u201d he said with warmth and haste. \u201cI do not, and never did, like Sper\u00e1nski personally, but I like justice!\u201d\n\nPierre now recognized in his friend a need with which he was only too familiar, to get excited and to have arguments about extraneous matters in order to stifle thoughts that were too oppressive and too intimate. When Prince Meshch\u00e9rski had left, Prince Andrew took Pierre\u2019s arm and asked him into the room that had been assigned him. A bed had been made up there, and some open portmanteaus and trunks stood about. Prince Andrew went to one and took out a small casket, from which he drew a packet wrapped in paper. He did it all silently and very quickly. He stood up and coughed. His face was gloomy and his lips compressed.\n\n\u201cForgive me for troubling you....\u201d\n\nPierre saw that Prince Andrew was going to speak of Nat\u00e1sha, and his broad face expressed pity and sympathy. This expression irritated Prince Andrew, and in a determined, ringing, and unpleasant tone he continued:\n\n\u201cI have received a refusal from Countess Rost\u00f3va and have heard reports of your brother-in-law having sought her hand, or something of that kind. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cBoth true and untrue,\u201d Pierre began; but Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n\n\u201cHere are her letters and her portrait,\u201d said he.\n\nHe took the packet from the table and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\u201cGive this to the countess... if you see her.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is very ill,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cThen she is here still?\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cAnd Prince Kur\u00e1gin?\u201d he added quickly.\n\n\u201cHe left long ago. She has been at death\u2019s door.\u201d\n\n\u201cI much regret her illness,\u201d said Prince Andrew; and he smiled like his father, coldly, maliciously, and unpleasantly.\n\n\u201cSo Monsieur Kur\u00e1gin has not honored Countess Rost\u00f3va with his hand?\u201d said Prince Andrew, and he snorted several times.\n\n\u201cHe could not marry, for he was married already,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew laughed disagreeably, again reminding one of his father.\n\n\u201cAnd where is your brother-in-law now, if I may ask?\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cHe has gone to Peters... But I don\u2019t know,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cWell, it doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d said Prince Andrew. \u201cTell Countess Rost\u00f3va that she was and is perfectly free and that I wish her all that is good.\u201d\n\nPierre took the packet. Prince Andrew, as if trying to remember whether he had something more to say, or waiting to see if Pierre would say anything, looked fixedly at him.\n\n\u201cI say, do you remember our discussion in Petersburg?\u201d asked Pierre, \u201cabout...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d returned Prince Andrew hastily. \u201cI said that a fallen woman should be forgiven, but I didn\u2019t say I could forgive her. I can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut can this be compared...?\u201d said Pierre.\n\nPrince Andrew interrupted him and cried sharply: \u201cYes, ask her hand again, be magnanimous, and so on?... Yes, that would be very noble, but I am unable to follow in that gentleman\u2019s footsteps. If you wish to be my friend never speak to me of that... of all that! Well, good-by. So you\u2019ll give her the packet?\u201d\n\nPierre left the room and went to the old prince and Princess Mary.\n\nThe old man seemed livelier than usual. Princess Mary was the same as always, but beneath her sympathy for her brother, Pierre noticed her satisfaction that the engagement had been broken off. Looking at them Pierre realized what contempt and animosity they all felt for the Rost\u00f3vs, and that it was impossible in their presence even to mention the name of her who could give up Prince Andrew for anyone else.\n\nAt dinner the talk turned on the war, the approach of which was becoming evident. Prince Andrew talked incessantly, arguing now with his father, now with the Swiss tutor Dessalles, and showing an unnatural animation, the cause of which Pierre so well understood.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nThat same evening Pierre went to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 to fulfill the commission entrusted to him. Nat\u00e1sha was in bed, the count at the club, and Pierre, after giving the letters to S\u00f3nya, went to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna who was interested to know how Prince Andrew had taken the news. Ten minutes later S\u00f3nya came to M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha insists on seeing Count Peter Kir\u00edlovich,\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cBut how? Are we to take him up to her? The room there has not been tidied up.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she has dressed and gone into the drawing room,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\nM\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna only shrugged her shoulders.\n\n\u201cWhen will her mother come? She has worried me to death! Now mind, don\u2019t tell her everything!\u201d said she to Pierre. \u201cOne hasn\u2019t the heart to scold her, she is so much to be pitied, so much to be pitied.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha was standing in the middle of the drawing room, emaciated, with a pale set face, but not at all shamefaced as Pierre expected to find her. When he appeared at the door she grew flurried, evidently undecided whether to go to meet him or to wait till he came up.\n\nPierre hastened to her. He thought she would give him her hand as usual; but she, stepping up to him, stopped, breathing heavily, her arms hanging lifelessly just in the pose she used to stand in when she went to the middle of the ballroom to sing, but with quite a different expression of face.\n\n\u201cPeter Kir\u00edlovich,\u201d she began rapidly, \u201cPrince Bolk\u00f3nski was your friend\u2014is your friend,\u201d she corrected herself. (It seemed to her that everything that had once been must now be different.) \u201cHe told me once to apply to you...\u201d\n\nPierre sniffed as he looked at her, but did not speak. Till then he had reproached her in his heart and tried to despise her, but he now felt so sorry for her that there was no room in his soul for reproach.\n\n\u201cHe is here now: tell him... to for... forgive me!\u201d She stopped and breathed still more quickly, but did not shed tears.\n\n\u201cYes... I will tell him,\u201d answered Pierre; \u201cbut...\u201d\n\nHe did not know what to say.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was evidently dismayed at the thought of what he might think she had meant.\n\n\u201cNo, I know all is over,\u201d she said hurriedly. \u201cNo, that can never be. I\u2019m only tormented by the wrong I have done him. Tell him only that I beg him to forgive, forgive, forgive me for everything....\u201d\n\nShe trembled all over and sat down on a chair.\n\nA sense of pity he had never before known overflowed Pierre\u2019s heart.\n\n\u201cI will tell him, I will tell him everything once more,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cBut... I should like to know one thing....\u201d\n\n\u201cKnow what?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s eyes asked.\n\n\u201cI should like to know, did you love...\u201d Pierre did not know how to refer to Anatole and flushed at the thought of him\u2014\u201cdid you love that bad man?\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t call him bad!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know, don\u2019t know at all....\u201d\n\nShe began to cry and a still greater sense of pity, tenderness, and love welled up in Pierre. He felt the tears trickle under his spectacles and hoped they would not be noticed.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t speak of it any more, my dear,\u201d said Pierre, and his gentle, cordial tone suddenly seemed very strange to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cWe won\u2019t speak of it, my dear\u2014I\u2019ll tell him everything; but one thing I beg of you, consider me your friend and if you want help, advice, or simply to open your heart to someone\u2014not now, but when your mind is clearer\u2014think of me!\u201d He took her hand and kissed it. \u201cI shall be happy if it\u2019s in my power...\u201d\n\nPierre grew confused.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t speak to me like that. I am not worth it!\u201d exclaimed Nat\u00e1sha and turned to leave the room, but Pierre held her hand.\n\nHe knew he had something more to say to her. But when he said it he was amazed at his own words.\n\n\u201cStop, stop! You have your whole life before you,\u201d said he to her.\n\n\u201cBefore me? No! All is over for me,\u201d she replied with shame and self-abasement.\n\n\u201cAll over?\u201d he repeated. \u201cIf I were not myself, but the handsomest, cleverest, and best man in the world, and were free, I would this moment ask on my knees for your hand and your love!\u201d\n\nFor the first time for many days Nat\u00e1sha wept tears of gratitude and tenderness, and glancing at Pierre she went out of the room.\n\nPierre too when she had gone almost ran into the anteroom, restraining tears of tenderness and joy that choked him, and without finding the sleeves of his fur cloak threw it on and got into his sleigh.\n\n\u201cWhere to now, your excellency?\u201d asked the coachman.\n\n\u201cWhere to?\u201d Pierre asked himself. \u201cWhere can I go now? Surely not to the Club or to pay calls?\u201d All men seemed so pitiful, so poor, in comparison with this feeling of tenderness and love he experienced: in comparison with that softened, grateful, last look she had given him through her tears.\n\n\u201cHome!\u201d said Pierre, and despite twenty-two degrees of frost Fahrenheit he threw open the bearskin cloak from his broad chest and inhaled the air with joy.\n\nIt was clear and frosty. Above the dirty, ill-lit streets, above the black roofs, stretched the dark starry sky. Only looking up at the sky did Pierre cease to feel how sordid and humiliating were all mundane things compared with the heights to which his soul had just been raised. At the entrance to the Arb\u00e1t Square an immense expanse of dark starry sky presented itself to his eyes. Almost in the center of it, above the Prech\u00edstenka Boulevard, surrounded and sprinkled on all sides by stars but distinguished from them all by its nearness to the earth, its white light, and its long uplifted tail, shone the enormous and brilliant comet of 1812\u2014the comet which was said to portend all kinds of woes and the end of the world. In Pierre, however, that comet with its long luminous tail aroused no feeling of fear. On the contrary he gazed joyfully, his eyes moist with tears, at this bright comet which, having traveled in its orbit with inconceivable velocity through immeasurable space, seemed suddenly\u2014like an arrow piercing the earth\u2014to remain fixed in a chosen spot, vigorously holding its tail erect, shining and displaying its white light amid countless other scintillating stars. It seemed to Pierre that this comet fully responded to what was passing in his own softened and uplifted soul, now blossoming into a new life.\n\n\n\nBOOK NINE: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nFrom the close of the year 1811 an intensified arming and concentrating of the forces of Western Europe began, and in 1812 these forces\u2014millions of men, reckoning those transporting and feeding the army\u2014moved from the west eastwards to the Russian frontier, toward which since 1811 Russian forces had been similarly drawn. On the twelfth of June, 1812, the forces of Western Europe crossed the Russian frontier and war began, that is, an event took place opposed to human reason and to human nature. Millions of men perpetrated against one another such innumerable crimes, frauds, treacheries, thefts, forgeries, issues of false money, burglaries, incendiarisms, and murders as in whole centuries are not recorded in the annals of all the law courts of the world, but which those who committed them did not at the time regard as being crimes.\n\nWhat produced this extraordinary occurrence? What were its causes? The historians tell us with na\u00efve assurance that its causes were the wrongs inflicted on the Duke of Oldenburg, the nonobservance of the Continental System, the ambition of Napoleon, the firmness of Alexander, the mistakes of the diplomatists, and so on.\n\nConsequently, it would only have been necessary for Metternich, Rumy\u00e1ntsev, or Talleyrand, between a levee and an evening party, to have taken proper pains and written a more adroit note, or for Napoleon to have written to Alexander: \u201cMy respected Brother, I consent to restore the duchy to the Duke of Oldenburg\u201d\u2014and there would have been no war.\n\nWe can understand that the matter seemed like that to contemporaries. It naturally seemed to Napoleon that the war was caused by England\u2019s intrigues (as in fact he said on the island of St. Helena). It naturally seemed to members of the English Parliament that the cause of the war was Napoleon\u2019s ambition; to the Duke of Oldenburg, that the cause of the war was the violence done to him; to businessmen that the cause of the war was the Continental System which was ruining Europe; to the generals and old soldiers that the chief reason for the war was the necessity of giving them employment; to the legitimists of that day that it was the need of re-establishing les bons principes, and to the diplomatists of that time that it all resulted from the fact that the alliance between Russia and Austria in 1809 had not been sufficiently well concealed from Napoleon, and from the awkward wording of Memorandum No. 178. It is natural that these and a countless and infinite quantity of other reasons, the number depending on the endless diversity of points of view, presented themselves to the men of that day; but to us, to posterity who view the thing that happened in all its magnitude and perceive its plain and terrible meaning, these causes seem insufficient. To us it is incomprehensible that millions of Christian men killed and tortured each other either because Napoleon was ambitious or Alexander was firm, or because England\u2019s policy was astute or the Duke of Oldenburg wronged. We cannot grasp what connection such circumstances have with the actual fact of slaughter and violence: why because the Duke was wronged, thousands of men from the other side of Europe killed and ruined the people of Smol\u00e9nsk and Moscow and were killed by them.\n\nTo us, their descendants, who are not historians and are not carried away by the process of research and can therefore regard the event with unclouded common sense, an incalculable number of causes present themselves. The deeper we delve in search of these causes the more of them we find; and each separate cause or whole series of causes appears to us equally valid in itself and equally false by its insignificance compared to the magnitude of the events, and by its impotence\u2014apart from the cooperation of all the other coincident causes\u2014to occasion the event. To us, the wish or objection of this or that French corporal to serve a second term appears as much a cause as Napoleon\u2019s refusal to withdraw his troops beyond the Vistula and to restore the duchy of Oldenburg; for had he not wished to serve, and had a second, a third, and a thousandth corporal and private also refused, there would have been so many less men in Napoleon\u2019s army and the war could not have occurred.\n\nHad Napoleon not taken offense at the demand that he should withdraw beyond the Vistula, and not ordered his troops to advance, there would have been no war; but had all his sergeants objected to serving a second term then also there could have been no war. Nor could there have been a war had there been no English intrigues and no Duke of Oldenburg, and had Alexander not felt insulted, and had there not been an autocratic government in Russia, or a Revolution in France and a subsequent dictatorship and Empire, or all the things that produced the French Revolution, and so on. Without each of these causes nothing could have happened. So all these causes\u2014myriads of causes\u2014coincided to bring it about. And so there was no one cause for that occurrence, but it had to occur because it had to. Millions of men, renouncing their human feelings and reason, had to go from west to east to slay their fellows, just as some centuries previously hordes of men had come from the east to the west, slaying their fellows.\n\nThe actions of Napoleon and Alexander, on whose words the event seemed to hang, were as little voluntary as the actions of any soldier who was drawn into the campaign by lot or by conscription. This could not be otherwise, for in order that the will of Napoleon and Alexander (on whom the event seemed to depend) should be carried out, the concurrence of innumerable circumstances was needed without any one of which the event could not have taken place. It was necessary that millions of men in whose hands lay the real power\u2014the soldiers who fired, or transported provisions and guns\u2014should consent to carry out the will of these weak individuals, and should have been induced to do so by an infinite number of diverse and complex causes.\n\nWe are forced to fall back on fatalism as an explanation of irrational events (that is to say, events the reasonableness of which we do not understand). The more we try to explain such events in history reasonably, the more unreasonable and incomprehensible do they become to us.\n\nEach man lives for himself, using his freedom to attain his personal aims, and feels with his whole being that he can now do or abstain from doing this or that action; but as soon as he has done it, that action performed at a certain moment in time becomes irrevocable and belongs to history, in which it has not a free but a predestined significance.\n\nThere are two sides to the life of every man, his individual life, which is the more free the more abstract its interests, and his elemental hive life in which he inevitably obeys laws laid down for him.\n\nMan lives consciously for himself, but is an unconscious instrument in the attainment of the historic, universal, aims of humanity. A deed done is irrevocable, and its result coinciding in time with the actions of millions of other men assumes an historic significance. The higher a man stands on the social ladder, the more people he is connected with and the more power he has over others, the more evident is the predestination and inevitability of his every action.\n\n\u201cThe king\u2019s heart is in the hands of the Lord.\u201d\n\nA king is history\u2019s slave.\n\nHistory, that is, the unconscious, general, hive life of mankind, uses every moment of the life of kings as a tool for its own purposes.\n\nThough Napoleon at that time, in 1812, was more convinced than ever that it depended on him, verser (ou ne pas verser) le sang de ses peuples\u2014as Alexander expressed it in the last letter he wrote him\u2014he had never been so much in the grip of inevitable laws, which compelled him, while thinking that he was acting on his own volition, to perform for the hive life\u2014that is to say, for history\u2014whatever had to be performed.\n\nThe people of the west moved eastwards to slay their fellow men, and by the law of coincidence thousands of minute causes fitted in and co-ordinated to produce that movement and war: reproaches for the nonobservance of the Continental System, the Duke of Oldenburg\u2019s wrongs, the movement of troops into Prussia\u2014undertaken (as it seemed to Napoleon) only for the purpose of securing an armed peace, the French Emperor\u2019s love and habit of war coinciding with his people\u2019s inclinations, allurement by the grandeur of the preparations, and the expenditure on those preparations and the need of obtaining advantages to compensate for that expenditure, the intoxicating honors he received in Dresden, the diplomatic negotiations which, in the opinion of contemporaries, were carried on with a sincere desire to attain peace, but which only wounded the self-love of both sides, and millions of other causes that adapted themselves to the event that was happening or coincided with it.\n\nWhen an apple has ripened and falls, why does it fall? Because of its attraction to the earth, because its stalk withers, because it is dried by the sun, because it grows heavier, because the wind shakes it, or because the boy standing below wants to eat it?\n\nNothing is the cause. All this is only the coincidence of conditions in which all vital organic and elemental events occur. And the botanist who finds that the apple falls because the cellular tissue decays and so forth is equally right with the child who stands under the tree and says the apple fell because he wanted to eat it and prayed for it. Equally right or wrong is he who says that Napoleon went to Moscow because he wanted to, and perished because Alexander desired his destruction, and he who says that an undermined hill weighing a million tons fell because the last navvy struck it for the last time with his mattock. In historic events the so-called great men are labels giving names to events, and like labels they have but the smallest connection with the event itself.\n\nEvery act of theirs, which appears to them an act of their own will, is in an historical sense involuntary and is related to the whole course of history and predestined from eternity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOn the twenty-ninth of May Napoleon left Dresden, where he had spent three weeks surrounded by a court that included princes, dukes, kings, and even an emperor. Before leaving, Napoleon showed favor to the emperor, kings, and princes who had deserved it, reprimanded the kings and princes with whom he was dissatisfied, presented pearls and diamonds of his own\u2014that is, which he had taken from other kings\u2014to the Empress of Austria, and having, as his historian tells us, tenderly embraced the Empress Marie Louise\u2014who regarded him as her husband, though he had left another wife in Paris\u2014left her grieved by the parting which she seemed hardly able to bear. Though the diplomatists still firmly believed in the possibility of peace and worked zealously to that end, and though the Emperor Napoleon himself wrote a letter to Alexander, calling him Monsieur mon fr\u00e8re, and sincerely assured him that he did not want war and would always love and honor him\u2014yet he set off to join his army, and at every station gave fresh orders to accelerate the movement of his troops from west to east. He went in a traveling coach with six horses, surrounded by pages, aides-de-camp, and an escort, along the road to Posen, Thorn, Danzig, and K\u00f6nigsberg. At each of these towns thousands of people met him with excitement and enthusiasm.\n\nThe army was moving from west to east, and relays of six horses carried him in the same direction. On the tenth of June, coming up with the army, he spent the night in apartments prepared for him on the estate of a Polish count in the Vilkavisski forest.\n\nNext day, overtaking the army, he went in a carriage to the Niemen, and, changing into a Polish uniform, he drove to the riverbank in order to select a place for the crossing.\n\nSeeing, on the other side, some Cossacks (les Cosaques) and the wide-spreading steppes in the midst of which lay the holy city of Moscow (Moscou, la ville sainte), the capital of a realm such as the Scythia into which Alexander the Great had marched\u2014Napoleon unexpectedly, and contrary alike to strategic and diplomatic considerations, ordered an advance, and the next day his army began to cross the Niemen.\n\nEarly in the morning of the twelfth of June he came out of his tent, which was pitched that day on the steep left bank of the Niemen, and looked through a spyglass at the streams of his troops pouring out of the Vilkavisski forest and flowing over the three bridges thrown across the river. The troops, knowing of the Emperor\u2019s presence, were on the lookout for him, and when they caught sight of a figure in an overcoat and a cocked hat standing apart from his suite in front of his tent on the hill, they threw up their caps and shouted: \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d and one after another poured in a ceaseless stream out of the vast forest that had concealed them and, separating, flowed on and on by the three bridges to the other side.\n\n\u201cNow we\u2019ll go into action. Oh, when he takes it in hand himself, things get hot... by heaven!... There he is!... Vive l\u2019Empereur! So these are the steppes of Asia! It\u2019s a nasty country all the same. Au revoir, Beauch\u00e9; I\u2019ll keep the best palace in Moscow for you! Au revoir. Good luck!... Did you see the Emperor? Vive l\u2019Empereur!... preur!\u2014If they make me Governor of India, G\u00e9rard, I\u2019ll make you Minister of Kashmir\u2014that\u2019s settled. Vive l\u2019Empereur! Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah! The Cossacks\u2014those rascals\u2014see how they run! Vive l\u2019Empereur! There he is, do you see him? I\u2019ve seen him twice, as I see you now. The little corporal... I saw him give the cross to one of the veterans.... Vive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d came the voices of men, old and young, of most diverse characters and social positions. On the faces of all was one common expression of joy at the commencement of the long-expected campaign and of rapture and devotion to the man in the gray coat who was standing on the hill.\n\nOn the thirteenth of June a rather small, thoroughbred Arab horse was brought to Napoleon. He mounted it and rode at a gallop to one of the bridges over the Niemen, deafened continually by incessant and rapturous acclamations which he evidently endured only because it was impossible to forbid the soldiers to express their love of him by such shouting, but the shouting which accompanied him everywhere disturbed him and distracted him from the military cares that had occupied him from the time he joined the army. He rode across one of the swaying pontoon bridges to the farther side, turned sharply to the left, and galloped in the direction of K\u00f3vno, preceded by enraptured, mounted chasseurs of the Guard who, breathless with delight, galloped ahead to clear a path for him through the troops. On reaching the broad river V\u00edliya, he stopped near a regiment of Polish Uhlans stationed by the river.\n\n\u201cVivat!\u201d shouted the Poles, ecstatically, breaking their ranks and pressing against one another to see him.\n\nNapoleon looked up and down the river, dismounted, and sat down on a log that lay on the bank. At a mute sign from him, a telescope was handed him which he rested on the back of a happy page who had run up to him, and he gazed at the opposite bank. Then he became absorbed in a map laid out on the logs. Without lifting his head he said something, and two of his aides-de-camp galloped off to the Polish Uhlans.\n\n\u201cWhat? What did he say?\u201d was heard in the ranks of the Polish Uhlans when one of the aides-de-camp rode up to them.\n\nThe order was to find a ford and to cross the river. The colonel of the Polish Uhlans, a handsome old man, flushed and, fumbling in his speech from excitement, asked the aide-de-camp whether he would be permitted to swim the river with his Uhlans instead of seeking a ford. In evident fear of refusal, like a boy asking for permission to get on a horse, he begged to be allowed to swim across the river before the Emperor\u2019s eyes. The aide-de-camp replied that probably the Emperor would not be displeased at this excess of zeal.\n\nAs soon as the aide-de-camp had said this, the old mustached officer, with happy face and sparkling eyes, raised his saber, shouted \u201cVivat!\u201d and, commanding the Uhlans to follow him, spurred his horse and galloped into the river. He gave an angry thrust to his horse, which had grown restive under him, and plunged into the water, heading for the deepest part where the current was swift. Hundreds of Uhlans galloped in after him. It was cold and uncanny in the rapid current in the middle of the stream, and the Uhlans caught hold of one another as they fell off their horses. Some of the horses were drowned and some of the men; the others tried to swim on, some in the saddle and some clinging to their horses\u2019 manes. They tried to make their way forward to the opposite bank and, though there was a ford one third of a mile away, were proud that they were swimming and drowning in this river under the eyes of the man who sat on the log and was not even looking at what they were doing. When the aide-de-camp, having returned and choosing an opportune moment, ventured to draw the Emperor\u2019s attention to the devotion of the Poles to his person, the little man in the gray overcoat got up and, having summoned Berthier, began pacing up and down the bank with him, giving him instructions and occasionally glancing disapprovingly at the drowning Uhlans who distracted his attention.\n\nFor him it was no new conviction that his presence in any part of the world, from Africa to the steppes of Muscovy alike, was enough to dumfound people and impel them to insane self-oblivion. He called for his horse and rode to his quarters.\n\nSome forty Uhlans were drowned in the river, though boats were sent to their assistance. The majority struggled back to the bank from which they had started. The colonel and some of his men got across and with difficulty clambered out on the further bank. And as soon as they had got out, in their soaked and streaming clothes, they shouted \u201cVivat!\u201d and looked ecstatically at the spot where Napoleon had been but where he no longer was and at that moment considered themselves happy.\n\nThat evening, between issuing one order that the forged Russian paper money prepared for use in Russia should be delivered as quickly as possible and another that a Saxon should be shot, on whom a letter containing information about the orders to the French army had been found, Napoleon also gave instructions that the Polish colonel who had needlessly plunged into the river should be enrolled in the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur of which Napoleon was himself the head.\n\nQuos vult perdere dementat.\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Emperor of Russia had, meanwhile, been in V\u00edlna for more than a month, reviewing troops and holding maneuvers. Nothing was ready for the war that everyone expected and to prepare for which the Emperor had come from Petersburg. There was no general plan of action. The vacillation between the various plans that were proposed had even increased after the Emperor had been at headquarters for a month. Each of the three armies had its own commander in chief, but there was no supreme commander of all the forces, and the Emperor did not assume that responsibility himself.\n\nThe longer the Emperor remained in V\u00edlna the less did everybody\u2014tired of waiting\u2014prepare for the war. All the efforts of those who surrounded the sovereign seemed directed merely to making him spend his time pleasantly and forget that war was impending.\n\nIn June, after many balls and fetes given by the Polish magnates, by the courtiers, and by the Emperor himself, it occurred to one of the Polish aides-de-camp in attendance that a dinner and ball should be given for the Emperor by his aides-de-camp. This idea was eagerly received. The Emperor gave his consent. The aides-de-camp collected money by subscription. The lady who was thought to be most pleasing to the Emperor was invited to act as hostess. Count Bennigsen, being a landowner in the V\u00edlna province, offered his country house for the fete, and the thirteenth of June was fixed for a ball, dinner, regatta, and fireworks at Zakret, Count Bennigsen\u2019s country seat.\n\nThe very day that Napoleon issued the order to cross the Niemen, and his vanguard, driving off the Cossacks, crossed the Russian frontier, Alexander spent the evening at the entertainment given by his aides-de-camp at Bennigsen\u2019s country house.\n\nIt was a gay and brilliant fete. Connoisseurs of such matters declared that rarely had so many beautiful women been assembled in one place. Countess Bez\u00fakhova was present among other Russian ladies who had followed the sovereign from Petersburg to V\u00edlna and eclipsed the refined Polish ladies by her massive, so-called Russian type of beauty. The Emperor noticed her and honored her with a dance.\n\nBor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, having left his wife in Moscow and being for the present en gar\u00e7on (as he phrased it), was also there and, though not an aide-de-camp, had subscribed a large sum toward the expenses. Bor\u00eds was now a rich man who had risen to high honors and no longer sought patronage but stood on an equal footing with the highest of those of his own age. He was meeting H\u00e9l\u00e8ne in V\u00edlna after not having seen her for a long time and did not recall the past, but as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was enjoying the favors of a very important personage and Bor\u00eds had only recently married, they met as good friends of long standing.\n\nAt midnight dancing was still going on. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, not having a suitable partner, herself offered to dance the mazurka with Bor\u00eds. They were the third couple. Bor\u00eds, coolly looking at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s dazzling bare shoulders which emerged from a dark, gold-embroidered, gauze gown, talked to her of old acquaintances and at the same time, unaware of it himself and unnoticed by others, never for an instant ceased to observe the Emperor who was in the same room. The Emperor was not dancing, he stood in the doorway, stopping now one pair and now another with gracious words which he alone knew how to utter.\n\nAs the mazurka began, Bor\u00eds saw that Adjutant General Balash\u00ebv, one of those in closest attendance on the Emperor, went up to him and contrary to court etiquette stood near him while he was talking to a Polish lady. Having finished speaking to her, the Emperor looked inquiringly at Balash\u00ebv and, evidently understanding that he only acted thus because there were important reasons for so doing, nodded slightly to the lady and turned to him. Hardly had Balash\u00ebv begun to speak before a look of amazement appeared on the Emperor\u2019s face. He took Balash\u00ebv by the arm and crossed the room with him, unconsciously clearing a path seven yards wide as the people on both sides made way for him. Bor\u00eds noticed Arakch\u00e9ev\u2019s excited face when the sovereign went out with Balash\u00ebv. Arakch\u00e9ev looked at the Emperor from under his brow and, sniffing with his red nose, stepped forward from the crowd as if expecting the Emperor to address him. (Bor\u00eds understood that Arakch\u00e9ev envied Balash\u00ebv and was displeased that evidently important news had reached the Emperor otherwise than through himself.)\n\nBut the Emperor and Balash\u00ebv passed out into the illuminated garden without noticing Arakch\u00e9ev who, holding his sword and glancing wrathfully around, followed some twenty paces behind them.\n\nAll the time Bor\u00eds was going through the figures of the mazurka, he was worried by the question of what news Balash\u00ebv had brought and how he could find it out before others. In the figure in which he had to choose two ladies, he whispered to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne that he meant to choose Countess Potocka who, he thought, had gone out onto the veranda, and glided over the parquet to the door opening into the garden, where, seeing Balash\u00ebv and the Emperor returning to the veranda, he stood still. They were moving toward the door. Bor\u00eds, fluttering as if he had not had time to withdraw, respectfully pressed close to the doorpost with bowed head.\n\nThe Emperor, with the agitation of one who has been personally affronted, was finishing with these words:\n\n\u201cTo enter Russia without declaring war! I will not make peace as long as a single armed enemy remains in my country!\u201d It seemed to Bor\u00eds that it gave the Emperor pleasure to utter these words. He was satisfied with the form in which he had expressed his thoughts, but displeased that Bor\u00eds had overheard it.\n\n\u201cLet no one know of it!\u201d the Emperor added with a frown.\n\nBor\u00eds understood that this was meant for him and, closing his eyes, slightly bowed his head. The Emperor re-entered the ballroom and remained there about another half-hour.\n\nBor\u00eds was thus the first to learn the news that the French army had crossed the Niemen and, thanks to this, was able to show certain important personages that much that was concealed from others was usually known to him, and by this means he rose higher in their estimation.\n\n\nThe unexpected news of the French having crossed the Niemen was particularly startling after a month of unfulfilled expectations, and at a ball. On first receiving the news, under the influence of indignation and resentment the Emperor had found a phrase that pleased him, fully expressed his feelings, and has since become famous. On returning home at two o\u2019clock that night he sent for his secretary, Shishk\u00f3v, and told him to write an order to the troops and a rescript to Field Marshal Prince Saltyk\u00f3v, in which he insisted on the words being inserted that he would not make peace so long as a single armed Frenchman remained on Russian soil.\n\nNext day the following letter was sent to Napoleon:\n\nMonsieur mon fr\u00e8re,\n\nYesterday I learned that, despite the loyalty with which I have kept my engagements with Your Majesty, your troops have crossed the Russian frontier, and I have this moment received from Petersburg a note, in which Count Lauriston informs me, as a reason for this aggression, that Your Majesty has considered yourself to be in a state of war with me from the time Prince Kur\u00e1kin asked for his passports. The reasons on which the Duc de Bassano based his refusal to deliver them to him would never have led me to suppose that that could serve as a pretext for aggression. In fact, the ambassador, as he himself has declared, was never authorized to make that demand, and as soon as I was informed of it I let him know how much I disapproved of it and ordered him to remain at his post. If Your Majesty does not intend to shed the blood of our peoples for such a misunderstanding, and consents to withdraw your troops from Russian territory, I will regard what has passed as not having occurred and an understanding between us will be possible. In the contrary case, Your Majesty, I shall see myself forced to repel an attack that nothing on my part has provoked. It still depends on Your Majesty to preserve humanity from the calamity of another war.\n\nI am, etc.,\n\n(signed) Alexander\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAt two in the morning of the fourteenth of June, the Emperor, having sent for Balash\u00ebv and read him his letter to Napoleon, ordered him to take it and hand it personally to the French Emperor. When dispatching Balash\u00ebv, the Emperor repeated to him the words that he would not make peace so long as a single armed enemy remained on Russian soil and told him to transmit those words to Napoleon. Alexander did not insert them in his letter to Napoleon, because with his characteristic tact he felt it would be injudicious to use them at a moment when a last attempt at reconciliation was being made, but he definitely instructed Balash\u00ebv to repeat them personally to Napoleon.\n\nHaving set off in the small hours of the fourteenth, accompanied by a bugler and two Cossacks, Balash\u00ebv reached the French outposts at the village of Ryk\u00f3nty, on the Russian side of the Niemen, by dawn. There he was stopped by French cavalry sentinels.\n\nA French noncommissioned officer of hussars, in crimson uniform and a shaggy cap, shouted to the approaching Balash\u00ebv to halt. Balash\u00ebv did not do so at once, but continued to advance along the road at a walking pace.\n\nThe noncommissioned officer frowned and, muttering words of abuse, advanced his horse\u2019s chest against Balash\u00ebv, put his hand to his saber, and shouted rudely at the Russian general, asking: was he deaf that he did not do as he was told? Balash\u00ebv mentioned who he was. The noncommissioned officer began talking with his comrades about regimental matters without looking at the Russian general.\n\nAfter living at the seat of the highest authority and power, after conversing with the Emperor less than three hours before, and in general being accustomed to the respect due to his rank in the service, Balash\u00ebv found it very strange here on Russian soil to encounter this hostile, and still more this disrespectful, application of brute force to himself.\n\nThe sun was only just appearing from behind the clouds, the air was fresh and dewy. A herd of cattle was being driven along the road from the village, and over the fields the larks rose trilling, one after another, like bubbles rising in water.\n\nBalash\u00ebv looked around him, awaiting the arrival of an officer from the village. The Russian Cossacks and bugler and the French hussars looked silently at one another from time to time.\n\nA French colonel of hussars, who had evidently just left his bed, came riding from the village on a handsome sleek gray horse, accompanied by two hussars. The officer, the soldiers, and their horses all looked smart and well kept.\n\nIt was that first period of a campaign when troops are still in full trim, almost like that of peacetime maneuvers, but with a shade of martial swagger in their clothes, and a touch of the gaiety and spirit of enterprise which always accompany the opening of a campaign.\n\nThe French colonel with difficulty repressed a yawn, but was polite and evidently understood Balash\u00ebv\u2019s importance. He led him past his soldiers and behind the outposts and told him that his wish to be presented to the Emperor would most likely be satisfied immediately, as the Emperor\u2019s quarters were, he believed, not far off.\n\nThey rode through the village of Ryk\u00f3nty, past tethered French hussar horses, past sentinels and men who saluted their colonel and stared with curiosity at a Russian uniform, and came out at the other end of the village. The colonel said that the commander of the division was a mile and a quarter away and would receive Balash\u00ebv and conduct him to his destination.\n\nThe sun had by now risen and shone gaily on the bright verdure.\n\nThey had hardly ridden up a hill, past a tavern, before they saw a group of horsemen coming toward them. In front of the group, on a black horse with trappings that glittered in the sun, rode a tall man with plumes in his hat and black hair curling down to his shoulders. He wore a red mantle, and stretched his long legs forward in French fashion. This man rode toward Balash\u00ebv at a gallop, his plumes flowing and his gems and gold lace glittering in the bright June sunshine.\n\nBalash\u00ebv was only two horses\u2019 length from the equestrian with the bracelets, plumes, necklaces, and gold embroidery, who was galloping toward him with a theatrically solemn countenance, when Julner, the French colonel, whispered respectfully: \u201cThe King of Naples!\u201d It was, in fact, Murat, now called \u201cKing of Naples.\u201d Though it was quite incomprehensible why he should be King of Naples, he was called so, and was himself convinced that he was so, and therefore assumed a more solemn and important air than formerly. He was so sure that he really was the King of Naples that when, on the eve of his departure from that city, while walking through the streets with his wife, some Italians called out to him: \u201cViva il re!\u201d he turned to his wife with a pensive smile and said: \u201cPoor fellows, they don\u2019t know that I am leaving them tomorrow!\u201d\n\nBut though he firmly believed himself to be King of Naples and pitied the grief felt by the subjects he was abandoning, latterly, after he had been ordered to return to military service\u2014and especially since his last interview with Napoleon in Danzig, when his august brother-in-law had told him: \u201cI made you King that you should reign in my way, but not in yours!\u201d\u2014he had cheerfully taken up his familiar business, and\u2014like a well-fed but not overfat horse that feels himself in harness and grows skittish between the shafts\u2014he dressed up in clothes as variegated and expensive as possible, and gaily and contentedly galloped along the roads of Poland, without himself knowing why or whither.\n\nOn seeing the Russian general he threw back his head, with its long hair curling to his shoulders, in a majestically royal manner, and looked inquiringly at the French colonel. The colonel respectfully informed His Majesty of Balash\u00ebv\u2019s mission, whose name he could not pronounce.\n\n\u201cDe Bal-mach\u00e8ve!\u201d said the King (overcoming by his assurance the difficulty that had presented itself to the colonel). \u201cCharmed to make your acquaintance, General!\u201d he added, with a gesture of kingly condescension.\n\nAs soon as the King began to speak loud and fast his royal dignity instantly forsook him, and without noticing it he passed into his natural tone of good-natured familiarity. He laid his hand on the withers of Balash\u00ebv\u2019s horse and said:\n\n\u201cWell, General, it all looks like war,\u201d as if regretting a circumstance of which he was unable to judge.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty,\u201d replied Balash\u00ebv, \u201cmy master, the Emperor, does not desire war and as Your Majesty sees...\u201d said Balash\u00ebv, using the words Your Majesty at every opportunity, with the affectation ", "sequence": 15}, {"offset": 1600000, "text": "unavoidable in frequently addressing one to whom the title was still a novelty.\n\nMurat\u2019s face beamed with stupid satisfaction as he listened to \u201cMonsieur de Bal-mach\u00e8ve.\u201d But royaut\u00e9 oblige! and he felt it incumbent on him, as a king and an ally, to confer on state affairs with Alexander\u2019s envoy. He dismounted, took Balash\u00ebv\u2019s arm, and moving a few steps away from his suite, which waited respectfully, began to pace up and down with him, trying to speak significantly. He referred to the fact that the Emperor Napoleon had resented the demand that he should withdraw his troops from Prussia, especially when that demand became generally known and the dignity of France was thereby offended.\n\nBalash\u00ebv replied that there was \u201cnothing offensive in the demand, because...\u201d but Murat interrupted him.\n\n\u201cThen you don\u2019t consider the Emperor Alexander the aggressor?\u201d he asked unexpectedly, with a kindly and foolish smile.\n\nBalash\u00ebv told him why he considered Napoleon to be the originator of the war.\n\n\u201cOh, my dear general!\u201d Murat again interrupted him, \u201cwith all my heart I wish the Emperors may arrange the affair between them, and that the war begun by no wish of mine may finish as quickly as possible!\u201d said he, in the tone of a servant who wants to remain good friends with another despite a quarrel between their masters.\n\nAnd he went on to inquiries about the Grand Duke and the state of his health, and to reminiscences of the gay and amusing times he had spent with him in Naples. Then suddenly, as if remembering his royal dignity, Murat solemnly drew himself up, assumed the pose in which he had stood at his coronation, and, waving his right arm, said:\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t detain you longer, General. I wish success to your mission,\u201d and with his embroidered red mantle, his flowing feathers, and his glittering ornaments, he rejoined his suite who were respectfully awaiting him.\n\nBalash\u00ebv rode on, supposing from Murat\u2019s words that he would very soon be brought before Napoleon himself. But instead of that, at the next village the sentinels of Davout\u2019s infantry corps detained him as the pickets of the vanguard had done, and an adjutant of the corps commander, who was fetched, conducted him into the village to Marshal Davout.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nDavout was to Napoleon what Arakch\u00e9ev was to Alexander\u2014though not a coward like Arakch\u00e9ev, he was as precise, as cruel, and as unable to express his devotion to his monarch except by cruelty.\n\nIn the organism of states such men are necessary, as wolves are necessary in the organism of nature, and they always exist, always appear and hold their own, however incongruous their presence and their proximity to the head of the government may be. This inevitability alone can explain how the cruel Arakch\u00e9ev, who tore out a grenadier\u2019s mustache with his own hands, whose weak nerves rendered him unable to face danger, and who was neither an educated man nor a courtier, was able to maintain his powerful position with Alexander, whose own character was chivalrous, noble, and gentle.\n\nBalash\u00ebv found Davout seated on a barrel in the shed of a peasant\u2019s hut, writing\u2014he was auditing accounts. Better quarters could have been found him, but Marshal Davout was one of those men who purposely put themselves in most depressing conditions to have a justification for being gloomy. For the same reason they are always hard at work and in a hurry. \u201cHow can I think of the bright side of life when, as you see, I am sitting on a barrel and working in a dirty shed?\u201d the expression of his face seemed to say. The chief pleasure and necessity of such men, when they encounter anyone who shows animation, is to flaunt their own dreary, persistent activity. Davout allowed himself that pleasure when Balash\u00ebv was brought in. He became still more absorbed in his task when the Russian general entered, and after glancing over his spectacles at Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face, which was animated by the beauty of the morning and by his talk with Murat, he did not rise or even stir, but scowled still more and sneered malevolently.\n\nWhen he noticed in Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face the disagreeable impression this reception produced, Davout raised his head and coldly asked what he wanted.\n\nThinking he could have been received in such a manner only because Davout did not know that he was adjutant general to the Emperor Alexander and even his envoy to Napoleon, Balash\u00ebv hastened to inform him of his rank and mission. Contrary to his expectation, Davout, after hearing him, became still surlier and ruder.\n\n\u201cWhere is your dispatch?\u201d he inquired. \u201cGive it to me. I will send it to the Emperor.\u201d\n\nBalash\u00ebv replied that he had been ordered to hand it personally to the Emperor.\n\n\u201cYour Emperor\u2019s orders are obeyed in your army, but here,\u201d said Davout, \u201cyou must do as you\u2019re told.\u201d\n\nAnd, as if to make the Russian general still more conscious of his dependence on brute force, Davout sent an adjutant to call the officer on duty.\n\nBalash\u00ebv took out the packet containing the Emperor\u2019s letter and laid it on the table (made of a door with its hinges still hanging on it, laid across two barrels). Davout took the packet and read the inscription.\n\n\u201cYou are perfectly at liberty to treat me with respect or not,\u201d protested Balash\u00ebv, \u201cbut permit me to observe that I have the honor to be adjutant general to His Majesty....\u201d\n\nDavout glanced at him silently and plainly derived pleasure from the signs of agitation and confusion which appeared on Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYou will be treated as is fitting,\u201d said he and, putting the packet in his pocket, left the shed.\n\nA minute later the marshal\u2019s adjutant, de Castr\u00e8s, came in and conducted Balash\u00ebv to the quarters assigned him.\n\nThat day he dined with the marshal, at the same board on the barrels.\n\nNext day Davout rode out early and, after asking Balash\u00ebv to come to him, peremptorily requested him to remain there, to move on with the baggage train should orders come for it to move, and to talk to no one except Monsieur de Castr\u00e8s.\n\nAfter four days of solitude, ennui, and consciousness of his impotence and insignificance\u2014particularly acute by contrast with the sphere of power in which he had so lately moved\u2014and after several marches with the marshal\u2019s baggage and the French army, which occupied the whole district, Balash\u00ebv was brought to V\u00edlna\u2014now occupied by the French\u2014through the very gate by which he had left it four days previously.\n\nNext day the imperial gentleman-in-waiting, the Comte de Turenne, came to Balash\u00ebv and informed him of the Emperor Napoleon\u2019s wish to honor him with an audience.\n\nFour days before, sentinels of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment had stood in front of the house to which Balash\u00ebv was conducted, and now two French grenadiers stood there in blue uniforms unfastened in front and with shaggy caps on their heads, and an escort of hussars and Uhlans and a brilliant suite of aides-de-camp, pages, and generals, who were waiting for Napoleon to come out, were standing at the porch, round his saddle horse and his Mameluke, Rustan. Napoleon received Balash\u00ebv in the very house in V\u00edlna from which Alexander had dispatched him on his mission.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThough Balash\u00ebv was used to imperial pomp, he was amazed at the luxury and magnificence of Napoleon\u2019s court.\n\nThe Comte de Turenne showed him into a big reception room where many generals, gentlemen-in-waiting, and Polish magnates\u2014several of whom Balash\u00ebv had seen at the court of the Emperor of Russia\u2014were waiting. Duroc said that Napoleon would receive the Russian general before going for his ride.\n\nAfter some minutes, the gentleman-in-waiting who was on duty came into the great reception room and, bowing politely, asked Balash\u00ebv to follow him.\n\nBalash\u00ebv went into a small reception room, one door of which led into a study, the very one from which the Russian Emperor had dispatched him on his mission. He stood a minute or two, waiting. He heard hurried footsteps beyond the door, both halves of it were opened rapidly; all was silent and then from the study the sound was heard of other steps, firm and resolute\u2014they were those of Napoleon. He had just finished dressing for his ride, and wore a blue uniform, opening in front over a white waistcoat so long that it covered his rotund stomach, white leather breeches tightly fitting the fat thighs of his short legs, and Hessian boots. His short hair had evidently just been brushed, but one lock hung down in the middle of his broad forehead. His plump white neck stood out sharply above the black collar of his uniform, and he smelled of Eau de Cologne. His full face, rather young-looking, with its prominent chin, wore a gracious and majestic expression of imperial welcome.\n\nHe entered briskly, with a jerk at every step and his head slightly thrown back. His whole short corpulent figure with broad thick shoulders, and chest and stomach involuntarily protruding, had that imposing and stately appearance one sees in men of forty who live in comfort. It was evident, too, that he was in the best of spirits that day.\n\nHe nodded in answer to Balash\u00ebv\u2019s low and respectful bow, and coming up to him at once began speaking like a man who values every moment of his time and does not condescend to prepare what he has to say but is sure he will always say the right thing and say it well.\n\n\u201cGood day, General!\u201d said he. \u201cI have received the letter you brought from the Emperor Alexander and am very glad to see you.\u201d He glanced with his large eyes into Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face and immediately looked past him.\n\nIt was plain that Balash\u00ebv\u2019s personality did not interest him at all. Evidently only what took place within his own mind interested him. Nothing outside himself had any significance for him, because everything in the world, it seemed to him, depended entirely on his will.\n\n\u201cI do not, and did not, desire war,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut it has been forced on me. Even now\u201d (he emphasized the word) \u201cI am ready to receive any explanations you can give me.\u201d\n\nAnd he began clearly and concisely to explain his reasons for dissatisfaction with the Russian government. Judging by the calmly moderate and amicable tone in which the French Emperor spoke, Balash\u00ebv was firmly persuaded that he wished for peace and intended to enter into negotiations.\n\nWhen Napoleon, having finished speaking, looked inquiringly at the Russian envoy, Balash\u00ebv began a speech he had prepared long before: \u201cSire! The Emperor, my master...\u201d but the sight of the Emperor\u2019s eyes bent on him confused him. \u201cYou are flurried\u2014compose yourself!\u201d Napoleon seemed to say, as with a scarcely perceptible smile he looked at Balash\u00ebv\u2019s uniform and sword.\n\nBalash\u00ebv recovered himself and began to speak. He said that the Emperor Alexander did not consider Kur\u00e1kin\u2019s demand for his passports a sufficient cause for war; that Kur\u00e1kin had acted on his own initiative and without his sovereign\u2019s assent, that the Emperor Alexander did not desire war, and had no relations with England.\n\n\u201cNot yet!\u201d interposed Napoleon, and, as if fearing to give vent to his feelings, he frowned and nodded slightly as a sign that Balash\u00ebv might proceed.\n\nAfter saying all he had been instructed to say, Balash\u00ebv added that the Emperor Alexander wished for peace, but would not enter into negotiations except on condition that... Here Balash\u00ebv hesitated: he remembered the words the Emperor Alexander had not written in his letter, but had specially inserted in the rescript to Saltyk\u00f3v and had told Balash\u00ebv to repeat to Napoleon. Balash\u00ebv remembered these words, \u201cSo long as a single armed foe remains on Russian soil,\u201d but some complex feeling restrained him. He could not utter them, though he wished to do so. He grew confused and said: \u201cOn condition that the French army retires beyond the Niemen.\u201d\n\nNapoleon noticed Balash\u00ebv\u2019s embarrassment when uttering these last words; his face twitched and the calf of his left leg began to quiver rhythmically. Without moving from where he stood he began speaking in a louder tone and more hurriedly than before. During the speech that followed, Balash\u00ebv, who more than once lowered his eyes, involuntarily noticed the quivering of Napoleon\u2019s left leg which increased the more Napoleon raised his voice.\n\n\u201cI desire peace, no less than the Emperor Alexander,\u201d he began. \u201cHave I not for eighteen months been doing everything to obtain it? I have waited eighteen months for explanations. But in order to begin negotiations, what is demanded of me?\u201d he said, frowning and making an energetic gesture of inquiry with his small white plump hand.\n\n\u201cThe withdrawal of your army beyond the Niemen, sire,\u201d replied Balash\u00ebv.\n\n\u201cThe Niemen?\u201d repeated Napoleon. \u201cSo now you want me to retire beyond the Niemen\u2014only the Niemen?\u201d repeated Napoleon, looking straight at Balash\u00ebv.\n\nThe latter bowed his head respectfully.\n\nInstead of the demand of four months earlier to withdraw from Pomerania, only a withdrawal beyond the Niemen was now demanded. Napoleon turned quickly and began to pace the room.\n\n\u201cYou say the demand now is that I am to withdraw beyond the Niemen before commencing negotiations, but in just the same way two months ago the demand was that I should withdraw beyond the Vistula and the Oder, and yet you are willing to negotiate.\u201d\n\nHe went in silence from one corner of the room to the other and again stopped in front of Balash\u00ebv. Balash\u00ebv noticed that his left leg was quivering faster than before and his face seemed petrified in its stern expression. This quivering of his left leg was a thing Napoleon was conscious of. \u201cThe vibration of my left calf is a great sign with me,\u201d he remarked at a later date.\n\n\u201cSuch demands as to retreat beyond the Vistula and Oder may be made to a Prince of Baden, but not to me!\u201d Napoleon almost screamed, quite to his own surprise. \u201cIf you gave me Petersburg and Moscow I could not accept such conditions. You say I have begun this war! But who first joined his army? The Emperor Alexander, not I! And you offer me negotiations when I have expended millions, when you are in alliance with England, and when your position is a bad one. You offer me negotiations! But what is the aim of your alliance with England? What has she given you?\u201d he continued hurriedly, evidently no longer trying to show the advantages of peace and discuss its possibility, but only to prove his own rectitude and power and Alexander\u2019s errors and duplicity.\n\nThe commencement of his speech had obviously been made with the intention of demonstrating the advantages of his position and showing that he was nevertheless willing to negotiate. But he had begun talking, and the more he talked the less could he control his words.\n\nThe whole purport of his remarks now was evidently to exalt himself and insult Alexander\u2014just what he had least desired at the commencement of the interview.\n\n\u201cI hear you have made peace with Turkey?\u201d\n\nBalash\u00ebv bowed his head affirmatively.\n\n\u201cPeace has been concluded...\u201d he began.\n\nBut Napoleon did not let him speak. He evidently wanted to do all the talking himself, and continued to talk with the sort of eloquence and unrestrained irritability to which spoiled people are so prone.\n\n\u201cYes, I know you have made peace with the Turks without obtaining Moldavia and Wallachia; I would have given your sovereign those provinces as I gave him Finland. Yes,\u201d he went on, \u201cI promised and would have given the Emperor Alexander Moldavia and Wallachia, and now he won\u2019t have those splendid provinces. Yet he might have united them to his empire and in a single reign would have extended Russia from the Gulf of Bothnia to the mouths of the Danube. Catherine the Great could not have done more,\u201d said Napoleon, growing more and more excited as he paced up and down the room, repeating to Balash\u00ebv almost the very words he had used to Alexander himself at Tilsit. \u201cAll that, he would have owed to my friendship. Oh, what a splendid reign!\u201d he repeated several times, then paused, drew from his pocket a gold snuffbox, lifted it to his nose, and greedily sniffed at it.\n\n\u201cWhat a splendid reign the Emperor Alexander\u2019s might have been!\u201d\n\nHe looked compassionately at Balash\u00ebv, and as soon as the latter tried to make some rejoinder hastily interrupted him.\n\n\u201cWhat could he wish or look for that he would not have obtained through my friendship?\u201d demanded Napoleon, shrugging his shoulders in perplexity. \u201cBut no, he has preferred to surround himself with my enemies, and with whom? With Steins, Armfeldts, Bennigsens, and Wintzingerodes! Stein, a traitor expelled from his own country; Armfeldt, a rake and an intriguer; Wintzingerode, a fugitive French subject; Bennigsen, rather more of a soldier than the others, but all the same an incompetent who was unable to do anything in 1807 and who should awaken terrible memories in the Emperor Alexander\u2019s mind.... Granted that were they competent they might be made use of,\u201d continued Napoleon\u2014hardly able to keep pace in words with the rush of thoughts that incessantly sprang up, proving how right and strong he was (in his perception the two were one and the same)\u2014\u201cbut they are not even that! They are neither fit for war nor peace! Barclay is said to be the most capable of them all, but I cannot say so, judging by his first movements. And what are they doing, all these courtiers? Pfuel proposes, Armfeldt disputes, Bennigsen considers, and Barclay, called on to act, does not know what to decide on, and time passes bringing no result. Bagrati\u00f3n alone is a military man. He\u2019s stupid, but he has experience, a quick eye, and resolution.... And what role is your young monarch playing in that monstrous crowd? They compromise him and throw on him the responsibility for all that happens. A sovereign should not be with the army unless he is a general!\u201d said Napoleon, evidently uttering these words as a direct challenge to the Emperor. He knew how Alexander desired to be a military commander.\n\n\u201cThe campaign began only a week ago, and you haven\u2019t even been able to defend V\u00edlna. You are cut in two and have been driven out of the Polish provinces. Your army is grumbling.\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, Your Majesty,\u201d said Balash\u00ebv, hardly able to remember what had been said to him and following these verbal fireworks with difficulty, \u201cthe troops are burning with eagerness...\u201d\n\n\u201cI know everything!\u201d Napoleon interrupted him. \u201cI know everything. I know the number of your battalions as exactly as I know my own. You have not two hundred thousand men, and I have three times that number. I give you my word of honor,\u201d said Napoleon, forgetting that his word of honor could carry no weight\u2014\u201cI give you my word of honor that I have five hundred and thirty thousand men this side of the Vistula. The Turks will be of no use to you; they are worth nothing and have shown it by making peace with you. As for the Swedes\u2014it is their fate to be governed by mad kings. Their king was insane and they changed him for another\u2014Bernadotte, who promptly went mad\u2014for no Swede would ally himself with Russia unless he were mad.\u201d\n\nNapoleon grinned maliciously and again raised his snuffbox to his nose.\n\nBalash\u00ebv knew how to reply to each of Napoleon\u2019s remarks, and would have done so; he continually made the gesture of a man wishing to say something, but Napoleon always interrupted him. To the alleged insanity of the Swedes, Balash\u00ebv wished to reply that when Russia is on her side Sweden is practically an island: but Napoleon gave an angry exclamation to drown his voice. Napoleon was in that state of irritability in which a man has to talk, talk, and talk, merely to convince himself that he is in the right. Balash\u00ebv began to feel uncomfortable: as envoy he feared to demean his dignity and felt the necessity of replying; but, as a man, he shrank before the transport of groundless wrath that had evidently seized Napoleon. He knew that none of the words now uttered by Napoleon had any significance, and that Napoleon himself would be ashamed of them when he came to his senses. Balash\u00ebv stood with downcast eyes, looking at the movements of Napoleon\u2019s stout legs and trying to avoid meeting his eyes.\n\n\u201cBut what do I care about your allies?\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cI have allies\u2014the Poles. There are eighty thousand of them and they fight like lions. And there will be two hundred thousand of them.\u201d\n\nAnd probably still more perturbed by the fact that he had uttered this obvious falsehood, and that Balash\u00ebv still stood silently before him in the same attitude of submission to fate, Napoleon abruptly turned round, drew close to Balash\u00ebv\u2019s face, and, gesticulating rapidly and energetically with his white hands, almost shouted:\n\n\u201cKnow that if you stir up Prussia against me, I\u2019ll wipe it off the map of Europe!\u201d he declared, his face pale and distorted by anger, and he struck one of his small hands energetically with the other. \u201cYes, I will throw you back beyond the Dv\u00edna and beyond the Dnieper, and will re-erect against you that barrier which it was criminal and blind of Europe to allow to be destroyed. Yes, that is what will happen to you. That is what you have gained by alienating me!\u201d And he walked silently several times up and down the room, his fat shoulders twitching.\n\nHe put his snuffbox into his waistcoat pocket, took it out again, lifted it several times to his nose, and stopped in front of Balash\u00ebv. He paused, looked ironically straight into Balash\u00ebv\u2019s eyes, and said in a quiet voice:\n\n\u201cAnd yet what a splendid reign your master might have had!\u201d\n\nBalash\u00ebv, feeling it incumbent on him to reply, said that from the Russian side things did not appear in so gloomy a light. Napoleon was silent, still looking derisively at him and evidently not listening to him. Balash\u00ebv said that in Russia the best results were expected from the war. Napoleon nodded condescendingly, as if to say, \u201cI know it\u2019s your duty to say that, but you don\u2019t believe it yourself. I have convinced you.\u201d\n\nWhen Balash\u00ebv had ended, Napoleon again took out his snuffbox, sniffed at it, and stamped his foot twice on the floor as a signal. The door opened, a gentleman-in-waiting, bending respectfully, handed the Emperor his hat and gloves; another brought him a pocket handkerchief. Napoleon, without giving them a glance, turned to Balash\u00ebv:\n\n\u201cAssure the Emperor Alexander from me,\u201d said he, taking his hat, \u201cthat I am as devoted to him as before: I know him thoroughly and very highly esteem his lofty qualities. I will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter to the Emperor.\u201d\n\nAnd Napoleon went quickly to the door. Everyone in the reception room rushed forward and descended the staircase.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nAfter all that Napoleon had said to him\u2014those bursts of anger and the last dryly spoken words: \u201cI will detain you no longer, General; you shall receive my letter,\u201d Balash\u00ebv felt convinced that Napoleon would not wish to see him, and would even avoid another meeting with him\u2014an insulted envoy\u2014especially as he had witnessed his unseemly anger. But, to his surprise, Balash\u00ebv received, through Duroc, an invitation to dine with the Emperor that day.\n\nBessi\u00e8res, Caulaincourt, and Berthier were present at that dinner.\n\nNapoleon met Balash\u00ebv cheerfully and amiably. He not only showed no sign of constraint or self-reproach on account of his outburst that morning, but, on the contrary, tried to reassure Balash\u00ebv. It was evident that he had long been convinced that it was impossible for him to make a mistake, and that in his perception whatever he did was right, not because it harmonized with any idea of right and wrong, but because he did it.\n\nThe Emperor was in very good spirits after his ride through V\u00edlna, where crowds of people had rapturously greeted and followed him. From all the windows of the streets through which he rode, rugs, flags, and his monogram were displayed, and the Polish ladies, welcoming him, waved their handkerchiefs to him.\n\nAt dinner, having placed Balash\u00ebv beside him, Napoleon not only treated him amiably but behaved as if Balash\u00ebv were one of his own courtiers, one of those who sympathized with his plans and ought to rejoice at his success. In the course of conversation he mentioned Moscow and questioned Balash\u00ebv about the Russian capital, not merely as an interested traveler asks about a new city he intends to visit, but as if convinced that Balash\u00ebv, as a Russian, must be flattered by his curiosity.\n\n\u201cHow many inhabitants are there in Moscow? How many houses? Is it true that Moscow is called \u2018Holy Moscow\u2019? How many churches are there in Moscow?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd receiving the reply that there were more than two hundred churches, he remarked:\n\n\u201cWhy such a quantity of churches?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Russians are very devout,\u201d replied Balash\u00ebv.\n\n\u201cBut a large number of monasteries and churches is always a sign of the backwardness of a people,\u201d said Napoleon, turning to Caulaincourt for appreciation of this remark.\n\nBalash\u00ebv respectfully ventured to disagree with the French Emperor.\n\n\u201cEvery country has its own character,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cBut nowhere in Europe is there anything like that,\u201d said Napoleon.\n\n\u201cI beg your Majesty\u2019s pardon,\u201d returned Balash\u00ebv, \u201cbesides Russia there is Spain, where there are also many churches and monasteries.\u201d\n\nThis reply of Balash\u00ebv\u2019s, which hinted at the recent defeats of the French in Spain, was much appreciated when he related it at Alexander\u2019s court, but it was not much appreciated at Napoleon\u2019s dinner, where it passed unnoticed.\n\nThe uninterested and perplexed faces of the marshals showed that they were puzzled as to what Balash\u00ebv\u2019s tone suggested. \u201cIf there is a point we don\u2019t see it, or it is not at all witty,\u201d their expressions seemed to say. So little was his rejoinder appreciated that Napoleon did not notice it at all and na\u00efvely asked Balash\u00ebv through what towns the direct road from there to Moscow passed. Balash\u00ebv, who was on the alert all through the dinner, replied that just as \u201call roads lead to Rome,\u201d so all roads lead to Moscow: there were many roads, and \u201camong them the road through Polt\u00e1va, which Charles XII chose.\u201d Balash\u00ebv involuntarily flushed with pleasure at the aptitude of this reply, but hardly had he uttered the word Polt\u00e1va before Caulaincourt began speaking of the badness of the road from Petersburg to Moscow and of his Petersburg reminiscences.\n\nAfter dinner they went to drink coffee in Napoleon\u2019s study, which four days previously had been that of the Emperor Alexander. Napoleon sat down, toying with his S\u00e8vres coffee cup, and motioned Balash\u00ebv to a chair beside him.\n\nNapoleon was in that well-known after-dinner mood which, more than any reasoned cause, makes a man contented with himself and disposed to consider everyone his friend. It seemed to him that he was surrounded by men who adored him: and he felt convinced that, after his dinner, Balash\u00ebv too was his friend and worshiper. Napoleon turned to him with a pleasant, though slightly ironic, smile.\n\n\u201cThey tell me this is the room the Emperor Alexander occupied? Strange, isn\u2019t it, General?\u201d he said, evidently not doubting that this remark would be agreeable to his hearer since it went to prove his, Napoleon\u2019s, superiority to Alexander.\n\nBalash\u00ebv made no reply and bowed his head in silence.\n\n\u201cYes. Four days ago in this room, Wintzingerode and Stein were deliberating,\u201d continued Napoleon with the same derisive and self-confident smile. \u201cWhat I can\u2019t understand,\u201d he went on, \u201cis that the Emperor Alexander has surrounded himself with my personal enemies. That I do not... understand. Has he not thought that I may do the same?\u201d and he turned inquiringly to Balash\u00ebv, and evidently this thought turned him back on to the track of his morning\u2019s anger, which was still fresh in him.\n\n\u201cAnd let him know that I will do so!\u201d said Napoleon, rising and pushing his cup away with his hand. \u201cI\u2019ll drive all his W\u00fcrttemberg, Baden, and Weimar relations out of Germany.... Yes. I\u2019ll drive them out. Let him prepare an asylum for them in Russia!\u201d\n\nBalash\u00ebv bowed his head with an air indicating that he would like to make his bow and leave, and only listened because he could not help hearing what was said to him. Napoleon did not notice this expression; he treated Balash\u00ebv not as an envoy from his enemy, but as a man now fully devoted to him and who must rejoice at his former master\u2019s humiliation.\n\n\u201cAnd why has the Emperor Alexander taken command of the armies? What is the good of that? War is my profession, but his business is to reign and not to command armies! Why has he taken on himself such a responsibility?\u201d\n\nAgain Napoleon brought out his snuffbox, paced several times up and down the room in silence, and then, suddenly and unexpectedly, went up to Balash\u00ebv and with a slight smile, as confidently, quickly, and simply as if he were doing something not merely important but pleasing to Balash\u00ebv, he raised his hand to the forty-year-old Russian general\u2019s face and, taking him by the ear, pulled it gently, smiling with his lips only.\n\nTo have one\u2019s ear pulled by the Emperor was considered the greatest honor and mark of favor at the French court.\n\n\u201cWell, adorer and courtier of the Emperor Alexander, why don\u2019t you say anything?\u201d said he, as if it was ridiculous, in his presence, to be the adorer and courtier of anyone but himself, Napoleon. \u201cAre the horses ready for the general?\u201d he added, with a slight inclination of his head in reply to Balash\u00ebv\u2019s bow. \u201cLet him have mine, he has a long way to go!\u201d\n\nThe letter taken by Balash\u00ebv was the last Napoleon sent to Alexander. Every detail of the interview was communicated to the Russian monarch, and the war began....\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nAfter his interview with Pierre in Moscow, Prince Andrew went to Petersburg, on business as he told his family, but really to meet Anatole Kur\u00e1gin whom he felt it necessary to encounter. On reaching Petersburg he inquired for Kur\u00e1gin but the latter had already left the city. Pierre had warned his brother-in-law that Prince Andrew was on his track. Anatole Kur\u00e1gin promptly obtained an appointment from the Minister of War and went to join the army in Moldavia. While in Petersburg Prince Andrew met Kut\u00fazov, his former commander who was always well disposed toward him, and Kut\u00fazov suggested that he should accompany him to the army in Moldavia, to which the old general had been appointed commander in chief. So Prince Andrew, having received an appointment on the headquarters staff, left for Turkey.\n\nPrince Andrew did not think it proper to write and challenge Kur\u00e1gin. He thought that if he challenged him without some fresh cause it might compromise the young Countess Rost\u00f3va and so he wanted to meet Kur\u00e1gin personally in order to find a fresh pretext for a duel. But he again failed to meet Kur\u00e1gin in Turkey, for soon after Prince Andrew arrived, the latter returned to Russia. In a new country, amid new conditions, Prince Andrew found life easier to bear. After his betrothed had broken faith with him\u2014which he felt the more acutely the more he tried to conceal its effects\u2014the surroundings in which he had been happy became trying to him, and the freedom and independence he had once prized so highly were still more so. Not only could he no longer think the thoughts that had first come to him as he lay gazing at the sky on the field of Austerlitz and had later enlarged upon with Pierre, and which had filled his solitude at Boguch\u00e1rovo and then in Switzerland and Rome, but he even dreaded to recall them and the bright and boundless horizons they had revealed. He was now concerned only with the nearest practical matters unrelated to his past interests, and he seized on these the more eagerly the more those past interests were closed to him. It was as if that lofty, infinite canopy of heaven that had once towered above him had suddenly turned into a low, solid vault that weighed him down, in which all was clear, but nothing eternal or mysterious.\n\nOf the activities that presented themselves to him, army service was the simplest and most familiar. As a general on duty on Kut\u00fazov\u2019s staff, he applied himself to business with zeal and perseverance and surprised Kut\u00fazov by his willingness and accuracy in work. Not having found Kur\u00e1gin in Turkey, Prince Andrew did not think it necessary to rush back to Russia after him, but all the same he knew that however long it might be before he met Kur\u00e1gin, despite his contempt for him and despite all the proofs he deduced to convince himself that it was not worth stooping to a conflict with him\u2014he knew that when he did meet him he would not be able to resist calling him out, any more than a ravenous man can help snatching at food. And the consciousness that the insult was not yet avenged, that his rancor was still unspent, weighed on his heart and poisoned the artificial tranquillity which he managed to obtain in Turkey by means of restless, plodding, and rather vainglorious and ambitious activity.\n\nIn the year 1812, when news of the war with Napoleon reached Bucharest\u2014where Kut\u00fazov had been living for two months, passing his days and nights with a Wallachian woman\u2014Prince Andrew asked Kut\u00fazov to transfer him to the Western Army. Kut\u00fazov, who was already weary of Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s activity which seemed to reproach his own idleness, very readily let him go and gave him a mission to Barclay de Tolly.\n\nBefore joining the Western Army which was then, in May, encamped at Drissa, Prince Andrew visited Bald Hills which was directly on his way, being only two miles off the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad. During the last three years there had been so many changes in his life, he had thought, felt, and seen so much (having traveled both in the east and the west), that on reaching Bald Hills it struck him as strange and unexpected to find the way of life there unchanged and still the same in every detail. He entered through the gates with their stone pillars and drove up the avenue leading to the house as if he were entering an enchanted, sleeping castle. The same old stateliness, the same cleanliness, the same stillness reigned there, and inside there was the same furniture, the same walls, sounds, and smell, and the same timid faces, only somewhat older. Princess Mary was still the same timid, plain maiden getting on in years, uselessly and joylessly passing the best years of her life in fear and constant suffering. Mademoiselle Bourienne was the same coquettish, self-satisfied girl, enjoying every moment of her existence and full of joyous hopes for the future. She had merely become more self-confident, Prince Andrew thought. Dessalles, the tutor he had brought from Switzerland, was wearing a coat of Russian cut and talking broken Russian to the servants, but was still the same narrowly intelligent, conscientious, and pedantic preceptor. The old prince had changed in appearance only by the loss of a tooth, which left a noticeable gap on one side of his mouth; in character he was the same as ever, only showing still more irritability and skepticism as to what was happening in the world. Little Nicholas alone had changed. He had grown, become rosier, had curly dark hair, and, when merry and laughing, quite unconsciously lifted the upper lip of his pretty little mouth just as the little princess used to do. He alone did not obey the law of immutability in the enchanted, sleeping castle. But though externally all remained as of old, the inner relations of all these people had changed since Prince Andrew had seen them last. The household was divided into two alien and hostile camps, who changed their habits for his sake and only met because he was there. To the one camp belonged the old prince, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and the architect; to the other Princess Mary, Dessalles, little Nicholas, and all the old nurses and maids.\n\nDuring his stay at Bald Hills all the family dined together, but they were ill at ease and Prince Andrew felt that he was a visitor for whose sake an exception was being made and that his presence made them all feel awkward. Involuntarily feeling this at dinner on the first day, he was taciturn, and the old prince noticing this also became morosely dumb and retired to his apartments directly after dinner. In the evening, when Prince Andrew went to him and, trying to rouse him, began to tell him of the young Count K\u00e1mensky\u2019s campaign, the old prince began unexpectedly to talk about Princess Mary, blaming her for her superstitions and her dislike of Mademoiselle Bourienne, who, he said, was the only person really attached to him.\n\nThe old prince said that if he was ill it was only because of Princess Mary: that she purposely worried and irritated him, and that by indulgence and silly talk she was spoiling little Prince Nicholas. The old prince knew very well that he tormented his daughter and that her life was very hard, but he also knew that he could not help tormenting her and that she deserved it. \u201cWhy does Prince Andrew, who sees this, say nothing to me about his sister? Does he think me a scoundrel, or an old fool who, without any reason, keeps his own daughter at a distance and attaches this Frenchwoman to himself? He doesn\u2019t understand, so I must explain it, and he must hear me out,\u201d thought the old prince. And he began explaining why he could not put up with his daughter\u2019s unreasonable character.\n\n\u201cIf you ask me,\u201d said Prince Andrew, without looking up (he was censuring his father for the first time in his life), \u201cI did not wish to speak about it, but as you ask me I will give you my frank opinion. If there is any misunderstanding and discord between you and Mary, I can\u2019t blame her for it at all. I know how she loves and respects you. Since you ask me,\u201d continued Prince Andrew, becoming irritable\u2014as he was always liable to do of late\u2014\u201cI can only say that if there are any misunderstandings they are caused by that worthless woman, who is not fit to be my sister\u2019s companion.\u201d\n\nThe old man at first stared fixedly at his son, and an unnatural smile disclosed the fresh gap between his teeth to which Prince Andrew could not get accustomed.\n\n\u201cWhat companion, my dear boy? Eh? You\u2019ve already been talking it over! Eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cFather, I did not want to judge,\u201d said Prince Andrew, in a hard and bitter tone, \u201cbut you challenged me, and I have said, and always shall say, that Mary is not to blame, but those to blame\u2014the one to blame\u2014is that Frenchwoman.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, he has passed judgment... passed judgement!\u201d said the old man in a low voice and, as it seemed to Prince Andrew, with some embarrassment, but then he suddenly jumped up and cried: \u201cBe off, be off! Let not a trace of you remain here!...\u201d\n\n\nPrince Andrew wished to leave at once, but Princess Mary persuaded him to stay another day. That day he did not see his father, who did not leave his room and admitted no one but Mademoiselle Bourienne and T\u00edkhon, but asked several times whether his son had gone. Next day, before leaving, Prince Andrew went to his son\u2019s rooms. The boy, curly-headed like his mother and glowing with health, sat on his knee, and Prince Andrew began telling him the story of Bluebeard, but fell into a reverie without finishing the story. He thought not of this pretty child, his son whom he held on his knee, but of himself. He sought in himself either remorse for having angered his father or regret at leaving home for the first time in his life on bad terms with him, and was horrified to find neither. What meant still more to him was that he sought and did not find in himself the former tenderness for his son which he had hoped to reawaken by caressing the boy and taking him on his knee.\n\n\u201cWell, go on!\u201d said his son.\n\nPrince Andrew, without replying, put him down from his knee and went out of the room.\n\nAs soon as Prince Andrew had given up his daily occupations, and especially on returning to the old conditions of life amid which he had been happy, weariness of life overcame him with its former intensity, and he hastened to escape from these memories and to find some work as soon as possible.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve decided to go, Andrew?\u201d asked his sister.\n\n\u201cThank God that I can,\u201d replied Prince Andrew. \u201cI am very sorry you can\u2019t.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cWhy do you say that, when you are going to this terrible war, and he is so old? Mademoiselle Bourienne says he has been asking about you....\u201d\n\nAs soon as she began to speak of that, her lips trembled and her tears began to fall. Prince Andrew turned away and began pacing the room.\n\n\u201cAh, my God! my God! When one thinks who and what\u2014what trash\u2014can cause people misery!\u201d he said with a malignity that alarmed Princess Mary.\n\nShe understood that when speaking of \u201ctrash\u201d he referred not only to Mademoiselle Bourienne, the cause of her misery, but also to the man who had ruined his own happiness.\n\n\u201cAndrew! One thing I beg, I entreat of you!\u201d she said, touching his elbow and looking at him with eyes that shone through her tears. \u201cI understand you\u201d (she looked down). \u201cDon\u2019t imagine that sorrow is the work of men. Men are His tools.\u201d She looked a little above Prince Andrew\u2019s head with the confident, accustomed look with which one looks at the place where a familiar portrait hangs. \u201cSorrow is sent by Him, not by men. Men are His instruments, they are not to blame. If you think someone has wronged you, forget it and forgive! We have no right to punish. And then you will know the happiness of forgiving.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were a woman I would do so, Mary. That is a woman\u2019s virtue. But a man should not and cannot forgive and forget,\u201d he replied, and though till that moment he had not been thinking of Kur\u00e1gin, all his unexpended anger suddenly swelled up in his heart.\n\n\u201cIf Mary is already persuading me to forgive, it means that I ought long ago to have punished him,\u201d he thought. And giving her no further reply, he began thinking of the glad vindictive moment when he would meet Kur\u00e1gin who he knew was now in the army.\n\nPrincess Mary begged him to stay one day more, saying that she knew how unhappy her father would be if Andrew left without being reconciled to him, but Prince Andrew replied that he would probably soon be back again from the army and would certainly write to his father, but that the longer he stayed now the more embittered their differences would become.\n\n\u201cGood-by, Andrew! Remember that misfortunes come from God, and men are never to blame,\u201d were the last words he heard from his sister when he took leave of her.\n\n\u201cThen it must be so!\u201d thought Prince Andrew as he drove out of the avenue from the house at Bald Hills. \u201cShe, poor innocent creature, is left to be victimized by an old man who has outlived his wits. The old man feels he is guilty, but cannot change himself. My boy is growing up and rejoices in life, in which like everybody else he will deceive or be deceived. And I am off to the army. Why? I myself don\u2019t know. I want to meet that man whom I despise, so as to give him a chance to kill and laugh at me!\u201d\n\nThese conditions of life had been the same before, but then they were all connected, while now they had all tumbled to pieces. Only senseless things, lacking coherence, presented themselves one after another to Prince Andrew\u2019s mind.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nPrince Andrew reached the general headquarters of the army at the end of June. The first army, with which was the Emperor, occupied the fortified camp at Drissa; the second army was retreating, trying to effect a junction with the first one from which it was said to be cut off by large French forces. Everyone was dissatisfied with the general course of affairs in the Russian army, but no one anticipated any danger of invasion of the Russian provinces, and no one thought the war would extend farther than the western, the Polish, provinces.\n\nPrince Andrew found Barclay de Tolly, to whom he had been assigned, on the bank of the Drissa. As there was not a single town or large village in the vicinity of the camp, the immense number of generals and courtiers accompanying the army were living in the best houses of the villages on both sides of the river, over a radius of six miles. Barclay de Tolly was quartered nearly three miles from the Emperor. He received Bolk\u00f3nski stiffly and coldly and told him in his foreign accent that he would mention him to the Emperor for a decision as to his employment, but asked him meanwhile to remain on his staff. Anatole Kur\u00e1gin, whom Prince Andrew had hoped to find with the army, was not there. He had gone to Petersburg, but Prince Andrew was glad to hear this. His mind was occupied by the interests of the center that was conducting a gigantic war, and he was glad to be free for a while from the distraction caused by the thought of Kur\u00e1gin. During the first four days, while no duties were required of him, Prince Andrew rode round the whole fortified camp and, by the aid of his own knowledge and by talks with experts, tried to form a definite opinion about it. But the question whether the camp was advantageous or disadvantageous remained for him undecided. Already from his military experience and what he had seen in the Austrian campaign, he had come to the conclusion that in war the most deeply considered plans have no significance and that all depends on the way unexpected movements of the enemy\u2014that cannot be foreseen\u2014are met, and on how and by whom the whole matter is handled. To clear up this last point for himself, Prince Andrew, utilizing his position and acquaintances, tried to fathom the character of the control of the army and of the men and parties engaged in it, and he deduced for himself the following of the state of affairs.\n\nWhile the Emperor had still been at V\u00edlna, the forces had been divided into three armies. First, the army under Barclay de Tolly, secondly, the army under Bagrati\u00f3n, and thirdly, the one commanded by Torm\u00e1sov. The Emperor was with the first army, but not as commander in chief. In the orders issued it was stated, not that the Emperor would take command, but only that he would be with the army. The Emperor, moreover, had with him not a commander in chief\u2019s staff but the imperial headquarters staff. In attendance on him was the head of the imperial staff, Quartermaster General Prince Volk\u00f3nski, as well as generals, imperial aides-de-camp, diplomatic officials, and a large number of foreigners, but not the army staff. Besides these, there were in attendance on the Emperor without any definite appointments: Arakch\u00e9ev, the ex-Minister of War; Count Bennigsen, the senior general in rank; the Grand Duke Tsar\u00e9vich Constantine P\u00e1vlovich; Count Rumy\u00e1ntsev, the Chancellor; Stein, a former Prussian minister; Armfeldt, a Swedish general; Pfuel, the chief author of the plan of campaign; Paulucci, an adjutant general and Sardinian \u00e9migr\u00e9; Wolzogen\u2014and many others. Though these men had no military appointment in the army, their position gave them influence, and often a corps commander, or even the commander in chief, did not know in what capacity he was questioned by Bennigsen, the Grand Duke, Arakch\u00e9ev, or Prince Volk\u00f3nski, or was given this or that advice and did not know whether a certain order received in the form of advice emanated from the man who gave it or from the Emperor and whether it had to be executed or not. But this was only the external condition; the essential significance of the presence of the Emperor and of all these people, from a courtier\u2019s point of view (and in an Emperor\u2019s vicinity all became courtiers), was clear to everyone. It was this: the Emperor did not assume the title of commander in chief, but disposed of all the armies; the men around him were his assistants. Arakch\u00e9ev was a faithful custodian to enforce order and acted as the sovereign\u2019s bodyguard. Bennigsen was a landlord in the V\u00edlna province who appeared to be doing the honors of the district, but was in reality a good general, useful as an adviser and ready at hand to replace Barclay. The Grand Duke was there because it suited him to be. The ex-Minister Stein was there because his advice was useful and the Emperor Alexander held him in high esteem personally. Armfeldt virulently hated Napoleon and was a general full of self-confidence, a quality that always influenced Alexander. Paulucci was there because he was bold and decided in speech. The adjutants general were there because they always accompanied the Emperor, and lastly and chiefly Pfuel was there because he had drawn up the plan of campaign against Napoleon and, having induced Alexander to believe in the efficacy of that plan, was directing the whole business of the war. With Pfuel was Wolzogen, who expressed Pfuel\u2019s thoughts in a more comprehensible way than Pfuel himself (who was a harsh, bookish theorist, self-confident to the point of despising everyone else) was able to do.\n\nBesides these Russians and foreigners who propounded new and unexpected ideas every day\u2014especially the foreigners, who did so with a boldness characteristic of people employed in a country not their own\u2014there were many secondary personages accompanying the army because their principals were there.\n\nAmong the opinions and voices in this immense, restless, brilliant, and proud sphere, Prince Andrew noticed the following sharply defined subdivisions of tendencies and parties:\n\nThe first party consisted of Pfuel and his adherents\u2014military theorists who believed in a science of war with immutable laws\u2014laws of oblique movements, outflankings, and so forth. Pfuel and his adherents demanded a retirement into the depths of the country in accordance with precise laws defined by a pseudo-theory of war, and they saw only barbarism, ignorance, or evil intention in every deviation from that theory. To this party belonged the foreign nobles, Wolzogen, Wintzingerode, and others, chiefly Germans.\n\nThe second party was directly opposed to the first; one extreme, as always happens, was met by representatives of the other. The members of this party were those who had demanded an advance from V\u00edlna into Poland and freedom from all prearranged plans. Besides being advocates of bold action, this section also represented nationalism, which made them still more one-sided in the dispute. They were Russians: Bagrati\u00f3n, Erm\u00f3lov (who was beginning to come to the front), and others. At that time a famous joke of Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s was being circulated, that as a great favor he had petitioned the Emperor to make him a German. The men of that party, remembering Suv\u00f3rov, said that what one had to do was not to reason, or stick pins into maps, but to fight, beat the enemy, keep him out of Russia, and not let the army get discouraged.\n\nTo the third party\u2014in which the Emperor had most confidence\u2014belonged the courtiers who tried to arrange compromises between the other two. The members of this party, chiefly civilians and to whom Arakch\u00e9ev belonged, thought and said what men who have no convictions but wish to seem to have some generally say. They said that undoubtedly war, particularly against such a genius as Bonaparte (they called him Bonaparte now), needs most deeply devised plans and profound scientific knowledge and in that respect Pfuel was a genius, but at the same time it had to be acknowledged that the theorists are often one-sided, and therefore one should not trust them absolutely, but should also listen to what Pfuel\u2019s opponents and practical men of experience in warfare had to say, and then choose a middle course. They insisted on the retention of the camp at Drissa, according to Pfuel\u2019s plan, but on changing the movements of the other armies. Though, by this course, neither one aim nor the other could be attained, yet it seemed best to the adherents of this third party.\n\nOf a fourth opinion the most conspicuous representative was the Tsar\u00e9vich, who could not forget his disillusionment at Austerlitz, where he had ridden out at the head of the Guards, in his casque and cavalry uniform as to a review, expecting to crush the French gallantly; but unexpectedly finding himself in the front line had narrowly escaped amid the general confusion. The men of this party had both the quality and the defect of frankness in their opinions. They feared Napoleon, recognized his strength and their own weakness, and frankly said so. They said: \u201cNothing but sorrow, shame, and ruin will come of all this! We have abandoned V\u00edlna and V\u00edtebsk and shall abandon Drissa. The only reasonable thing left to do is to conclude peace as soon as possible, before we are turned out of Petersburg.\u201d\n\nThis view was very general in the upper army circles and found support also in Petersburg and from the chancellor, Rumy\u00e1ntsev, who, for other reasons of state, was in favor of peace.\n\nThe fifth party consisted of those who were adherents of Barclay de Tolly, not so much as a man but as minister of war and commander in chief. \u201cBe he what he may\u201d (they always began like that), \u201che is an honest, practical man and we have nobody better. Give him real power, for war cannot be conducted successfully without unity of command, and he will show what he can do, as he did in Finland. If our army is well organized and strong and has withdrawn to Drissa without suffering any defeats, we owe this entirely to Barclay. If Barclay is now to be superseded by Bennigsen all will be lost, for Bennigsen showed his incapacity already in 1807.\u201d\n\nThe sixth party, the Bennigsenites, said, on the contrary, that at any rate there was no one more active and experienced than Bennigsen: \u201cand twist about as you may, you will have to come to Bennigsen eventually. Let the others make mistakes now!\u201d said they, arguing that our retirement to Drissa was a most shameful reverse and an unbroken series of blunders. \u201cThe more mistakes that are made the better. It will at any rate be understood all the sooner that things cannot go on like this. What is wanted is not some Barclay or other, but a man like Bennigsen, who made his mark in 1807, and to whom Napoleon himself did justice\u2014a man whose authority would be willingly recognized, and Bennigsen is the only such man.\u201d\n\nThe seventh party consisted of the sort of people who are always to be found, especially around young sovereigns, and of whom there were particularly many round Alexander\u2014generals and imperial aides-de-camp passionately devoted to the Emperor, not merely as a monarch but as a man, adoring him sincerely and disinterestedly, as Rost\u00f3v had done in 1805, and who saw in him not only all the virtues but all human capabilities as well. These men, though enchanted with the sovereign for refusing the command of the army, yet blamed him for such excessive modesty, and only desired and insisted that their adored sovereign should abandon his diffidence and openly announce that he would place himself at the head of the army, gather round him a commander in chief\u2019s staff, and, consulting experienced theoreticians and practical men where necessary, would himself lead the troops, whose spirits would thereby be raised to the highest pitch.\n\nThe eighth and largest group, which in its enormous numbers was to the others as ninety-nine to one, consisted of men who desired neither peace nor war, neither an advance nor a defensive camp at the Drissa or anywhere else, neither Barclay nor the Emperor, neither Pfuel nor Bennigsen, but only the one most essential thing\u2014as much advantage and pleasure for themselves as possible. In the troubled waters of conflicting and intersecting intrigues that eddied about the Emperor\u2019s headquarters, it was possible to succeed in many ways unthinkable at other times. A man who simply wished to retain his lucrative post would today agree with Pfuel, tomorrow with his opponent, and the day after, merely to avoid responsibility or to please the Emperor, would declare that he had no opinion at all on the matter. Another who wished to gain some advantage would attract the Emperor\u2019s attention by loudly advocating the very thing the Emperor had hinted at the day before, and would dispute and shout at the council, beating his breast and challenging those who did not agree with him to duels, thereby proving that he was prepared to sacrifice himself for the common good. A third, in the absence of opponents, between two councils would simply solicit a special gratuity for his faithful services, well knowing that at that moment people would be too busy to refuse him. A fourth while seemingly overwhelmed with work would often come accidentally under the Emperor\u2019s eye. A fifth, to achieve his long-cherished aim of dining with the Emperor, would stubbornly insist on the correctness or falsity of some newly emerging opinion and for this object would produce arguments more or less forcible and correct.\n\nAll the men of this party were fishing for rubles, decorations, and promotions, and in this pursuit watched only the weathercock of imperial favor, and directly they noticed it turning in any direction, this whole drone population of the army began blowing hard that way, so that it was all the harder for the Emperor to turn it elsewhere. Amid the uncertainties of the position, with the menace of serious danger giving a peculiarly threatening character to everything, amid this vortex of intrigue, egotism, conflict of views and feelings, and the diversity of race among these people\u2014this eighth and largest party of those preoccupied with personal interests imparted great confusion and obscurity to the common task. Whatever question arose, a swarm of these drones, without having finished their buzzing on a previous theme, flew over to the new one and by their hum drowned and obscured the voices of those who were disputing honestly.\n\nFrom among all these parties, just at the time Prince Andrew reached the army, another, a ninth party, was being formed and was beginning to raise its voice. This was the party of the elders, reasonable men experienced and capable in state affairs, who, without sharing any of those conflicting opinions, were able to take a detached view of what was going on at the staff at headquarters and to consider means of escape from this muddle, indecision, intricacy, and weakness.\n\nThe men of this party said and thought that what was wrong resulted chiefly from the Emperor\u2019s presence in the army with his military court and from the consequent presence there of an indefinite, conditional, and unsteady fluctuation of relations, which is in place at court but harmful in an army; that a sovereign should reign but not command the army, and that the only way out of the position would be for the Emperor and his court to leave the army; that the mere presence of the Emperor paralyzed the action of fifty thousand men required to secure his personal safety, and that the worst commander in chief, if independent, would be better than the very best one trammeled by the presence and authority of the monarch.\n\nJust at the time Prince Andrew was living unoccupied at Drissa, Shishk\u00f3v, the Secretary of State and one of the chief representatives of this party, wrote a letter to the Emperor which Arakch\u00e9ev and Balash\u00ebv agreed to sign. In this letter, availing himself of permission given him by the Emperor to discuss the general course of affairs, he respectfully suggested\u2014on the plea that it was necessary for the sovereign to arouse a warlike spirit in the people of the capital\u2014that the Emperor should leave the army.\n\nThat arousing of the people by their sovereign and his call to them to defend their country\u2014the very incitement which was the chief cause of Russia\u2019s triumph in so far as it was produced by the Tsar\u2019s personal presence in Moscow\u2014was suggested to the Emperor, and accepted by him, as a pretext for quitting the army.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThis letter had not yet been presented to the Emperor when Barclay, one day at dinner, informed Bolk\u00f3nski that the sovereign wished to see him personally, to question him about Turkey, and that Prince Andrew was to present himself at Bennigsen\u2019s quarters at six that evening.\n\nNews was received at the Emperor\u2019s quarters that very day of a fresh movement by Napoleon which might endanger the army\u2014news subsequently found to be false. And that morning Colonel Michaud had ridden round the Drissa fortifications with the Emperor and had pointed out to him that this fortified camp constructed by Pfuel, and till then considered a chef-d\u2019oeuvre of tactical science which would ensure Napoleon\u2019s destruction, was an absurdity, threatening the destruction of the Russian army.\n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Bennigsen\u2019s quarters\u2014a country gentleman\u2019s house of moderate size, situated on the very banks of the river. Neither Bennigsen nor the Emperor was there, but Chern\u00fdshev, the Emperor\u2019s aide-de-camp, received Bolk\u00f3nski and informed him that the Emperor, accompanied by General Bennigsen and Marquis Paulucci, had gone a second time that day to inspect the fortifications of the Drissa camp, of the suitability of which serious doubts were beginning to be felt.\n\nChern\u00fdshev was sitting at a window in the first room with a French novel in his hand. This room had probably been a music room; there was still an organ in it on which some rugs were piled, and in one corner stood the folding bedstead of Bennigsen\u2019s adjutant. This adjutant was also there and sat dozing on the rolled-up bedding, evidently exhausted by work or by feasting. Two doors led from the room, one straight on into what had been the drawing room, and another, on the right, to the study. Through the first door came the sound of voices conversing in German and occasionally in French. In that drawing room were gathered, by the Emperor\u2019s wish, not a military council (the Emperor preferred indefiniteness), but certain persons whose opinions he wished to know in view of the impending difficulties. It was not a council of war, but, as it were, a council to elucidate certain questions for the Emperor personally. To this semicouncil had been invited the Swedish General Armfeldt, Adjutant General Wolzogen, Wintzingerode (whom Napoleon had referred to as a renegade French subject), Michaud, Toll, Count Stein who was not a military man at all, and Pfuel himself, who, as Prince Andrew had heard, was the mainspring of the whole affair. Prince Andrew had an opportunity of getting a good look at him, for Pfuel arrived soon after himself and, in passing through to the drawing room, stopped a minute to speak to Chern\u00fdshev.\n\nAt first sight, Pfuel, in his ill-made uniform of a Russian general, which fitted him badly like a fancy costume, seemed familiar to Prince Andrew, though he saw him now for the first time. There was about him something of Weyrother, Mack, and Schmidt, and many other German theorist-generals whom Prince Andrew had seen in 1805, but he was more typical than any of them. Prince Andrew had never yet seen a German theorist in whom all the characteristics of those others were united to such an extent.\n\nPfuel was short and very thin but broad-boned, of coarse, robust build, broad in the hips, and with prominent shoulder blades. His face was much wrinkled and his eyes deep set. His hair had evidently been hastily brushed smooth in front of the temples, but stuck up behind in quaint little tufts. He entered the room, looking restlessly and angrily around, as if afraid of everything in that large apartment. Awkwardly holding up his sword, he addressed Chern\u00fdshev and asked in German where the Emperor was. One could see that he wished to pass through the rooms as quickly as possible, finish with the bows and greetings, and sit down to business in front of a map, where he would feel at home. He nodded hurriedly in reply to Chern\u00fdshev, and smiled ironically on hearing that the sovereign was inspecting the fortifications that he, Pfuel, had planned in accord with his theory. He muttered something to himself abruptly and in a bass voice, as self-assured Germans do\u2014it might have been \u201cstupid fellow\u201d... or \u201cthe whole affair will be ruined,\u201d or \u201csomething absurd will come of it.\u201d... Prince Andrew did not catch what he said and would have passed on, but Chern\u00fdshev introduced him to Pfuel, remarking that Prince Andrew was just back from Turkey where the war had terminated so fortunately. Pfuel barely glanced\u2014not so much at Prince Andrew as past him\u2014and said, with a laugh: \u201cThat must have been a fine tactical war\u201d; and, laughing contemptuously, went on into the room from which the sound of voices was heard.\n\nPfuel, always inclined to be irritably sarcastic, was particularly disturbed that day, evidently by the fact that they had dared to inspect and criticize his camp in his absence. From this short interview with Pfuel, Prince Andrew, thanks to his Austerlitz experiences, was able to form a clear conception of the man. Pfuel was one of those hopelessly and immutably self-confident men, self-confident to the point of martyrdom as only Germans are, because only Germans are self-confident on the basis of an abstract notion\u2014science, that is, the supposed knowledge of absolute truth. A Frenchman is self-assured because he regards himself personally, both in mind and body, as irresistibly attractive to men and women. An Englishman is self-assured, as being a citizen of the best-organized state in the world, and therefore as an Englishman always knows what he should do and knows that all he does as an Englishman is undoubtedly correct. An Italian is self-assured because he is excitable and easily forgets himself and other people. A Russian is self-assured just because he knows nothing and does not want to know anything, since he does not believe that anything can be known. The German\u2019s self-assurance is worst of all, stronger and more repulsive than any other, because he imagines that he knows the truth\u2014science\u2014which he himself has invented but which is for him the absolute truth.\n\nPfuel was evidently of that sort. He had a science\u2014the theory of oblique movements deduced by him from the history of Frederick the Great\u2019s wars, and all he came across in the history of more recent warfare seemed to him absurd and barbarous\u2014monstrous collisions in which so many blunders were committed by both sides that these wars could not be called wars, they did not accord with the theory, and therefore could not serve as material for science.\n\nIn 1806 Pfuel had been one of those responsible, for the plan of campaign that ended in Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt, but he did not see the least proof of the fallibility of his theory in the disasters of that war. On the contrary, the deviations made from his theory were, in his opinion, the sole cause of the whole disaster, and with characteristically gleeful sarcasm he would remark, \u201cThere, I said the whole affair would go to the devil!\u201d Pfuel was one of those theoreticians who so love their theory that they lose sight of the theory\u2019s object\u2014its practical application. His love of theory made him hate everything practical, and he would not listen to it. He was even pleased by failures, for failures resulting from deviations in practice from the theory only proved to him the accuracy of his theory.\n\nHe said a few words to Prince Andrew and Chern\u00fdshev about the present war, with the air of a man who knows beforehand that all will go wrong, and who is not displeased that it should be so. The unbrushed tufts of hair sticking up behind and the hastily brushed hair on his temples expressed this most eloquently.\n\nHe passed into the next room, and the deep, querulous sounds of his voice were at once heard from there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s eyes were still following Pfuel out of the room when Count Bennigsen entered hurriedly, and nodding to Bolk\u00f3nski, but not pausing, went into the study, giving instructions to his adjutant as he went. The Emperor was following him, and Bennigsen had hastened on to make some preparations and to be ready to receive the sovereign. Chern\u00fdshev and Prince Andrew went out into the porch, where the Emperor, who looked fatigued, was dismounting. Marquis Paulucci was talking to him with particular warmth and the Emperor, with his head bent to the left, was listening with a dissatisfied air. The Emperor moved forward evidently wishing to end the conversation, but the flushed and excited Italian, oblivious of decorum, followed him and continued to speak.\n\n\u201cAnd as for the man who advised forming this camp\u2014the Drissa camp,\u201d said Paulucci, as the Emperor mounted the steps and noticing Prince Andrew scanned his unfamiliar face, \u201cas to that person, sire...\u201d continued Paulucci, desperately, apparently unable to restrain himself, \u201cthe man who advised the Drissa camp\u2014I see no alternative but the lunatic asylum or the gallows!\u201d\n\nWithout heeding the end of the Italian\u2019s remarks, and as though not hearing them, the Emperor, recognizing Bolk\u00f3nski, addressed him graciously.\n\n\u201cI am very glad to see you! Go in there where they are meeting, and wait for me.\u201d\n\nThe Emperor went into the study. He was followed by Prince Peter Mikh\u00e1ylovich Volk\u00f3nski and Baron Stein, and the door closed behind them. Prince Andrew, taking advantage of the Emperor\u2019s permission, accompanied Paulucci, whom he had known in Turkey, into the drawing room where the council was assembled.\n\nPrince Peter Mikh\u00e1ylovich Volk\u00f3nski occupied the position, as it were, of chief of the Emperor\u2019s staff. He came out of the study into the drawing room with some maps which he spread on a table, and put questions on which he wished to hear the opinion of the gentlemen present. What had happened was that news (which afterwards proved to be false) had been received during the night of a movement by the French to outflank the Drissa camp.\n\nThe first to speak was General Armfeldt who, to meet the difficulty that presented itself, unexpectedly proposed a perfectly new position away from the Petersburg and Moscow roads. The reason for this was inexplicable (unless he wished to show that he, too, could have an opinion), but he urged that at this point the army should unite and there await the enemy. It was plain that Armfeldt had thought out that plan long ago and now expounded it not so much to answer the questions put\u2014which, in fact, his plan did not answer\u2014as to avail himself of the opportunity to air it. It was one of the millions of proposals, one as good as another, that could be made as long as it was quite unknown what character the war would take. Some disputed his arguments, others defended them. Young Count Toll objected to the Swedish general\u2019s views more warmly than anyone else, and in the course of the dispute drew from his side pocket a well-filled notebook, which he asked permission to read to them. In these voluminous notes Toll suggested another scheme, totally different from Armfeldt\u2019s or Pfuel\u2019s plan of campaign. In answer to Toll, Paulucci suggested an advance and an attack, which, he urged, could alone extricate us from the present uncertainty and from the trap (as he called the Drissa camp) in which we were situated.\n\nDuring all these discussions Pfuel and his interpreter, Wolzogen (his \u201cbridge\u201d in court relations), were silent. Pfuel only snorted contemptuously and turned away, to show that he would never demean himself by replying to such nonsense as he was now hearing. So when Prince Volk\u00f3nski, who was in the chair, called on him to give his opinion, he merely said:\n\n\u201cWhy ask me? General Armfeldt has proposed a splendid position with an exposed rear, or why not this Italian gentleman\u2019s attack\u2014very fine, or a retreat, also good! Why ask me?\u201d said he. \u201cWhy, you yourselves know everything better than I do.\u201d\n\nBut when Volk\u00f3nski said, with a frown, that it was in the Emperor\u2019s name that he asked his opinion, Pfuel rose and, suddenly growing animated, began to speak:\n\n\u201cEverything has been spoiled, everything muddled, everybody thought they knew better than I did, and now you come to me! How mend matters? There is nothing to mend! The principles laid down by me must be strictly adhered to,\u201d said he, drumming on the table with his bony fingers. \u201cWhat is the difficulty? Nonsense, childishness!\u201d\n\nHe went up to the map and speaking rapidly began proving that no eventuality could alter the efficiency of the Drissa camp, that everything had been foreseen, and that if the enemy were really going to outflank it, the enemy would inevitably be destroyed.\n\nPaulucci, who did not know German, began questioning him in French. Wolzogen came to the assistance of his chief, who spoke French badly, and began translating for him, hardly able to keep pace with Pfuel, who was rapidly demonstrating that not only all that had happened, but all that could happen, had been foreseen in his scheme, and that if there were now any difficulties the whole fault lay in the fact that his plan had not been precisely executed. He kept laughing sarcastically, he demonstrated, and at last contemptuously ceased to demonstrate, like a mathematician who ceases to prove in various ways the accuracy of a problem that has already been proved. Wolzogen took his place and continued to explain his views in French, every now and then turning to Pfuel and saying, \u201cIs it not so, your excellency?\u201d But Pfuel, like a man heated in a fight who strikes those on his own side, shouted angrily at his own supporter, Wolzogen:\n\n\u201cWell, of course, what more is there to explain?\u201d\n\nPaulucci and Michaud both attacked Wolzogen simultaneously in French. Armfeldt addressed Pfuel in German. Toll explained to Volk\u00f3nski in Russian. Prince Andrew listened and observed in silence.\n\nOf all these men Prince Andrew sympathized most with Pfuel, angry, determined, and absurdly self-confident as he was. Of all those present, evidently he alone was not seeking anything for himself, nursed no hatred against anyone, and only desired that the plan, formed on a theory arrived at by years of toil, should be carried out. He was ridiculous, and unpleasantly sarcastic, but yet he inspired involuntary respect by his boundless devotion to an idea. Besides this, the remarks of all except Pfuel had one common trait that had not been noticeable at the council of war in 1805: there was now a panic fear of Napoleon\u2019s genius, which, though concealed, was noticeable in every rejoinder. Everything was assumed to be possible for Napoleon, they expected him from every side, and invoked his terrible name to shatter each other\u2019s proposals. Pfuel alone seemed to consider Napoleon a barbarian like everyone else who opposed his theory. But besides this feeling of respect, Pfuel evoked pity in Prince Andrew. From the tone in which the courtiers addressed him and the way Paulucci had allowed himself to speak of him to the Emperor, but above all from a certain desperation in Pfuel\u2019s own expressions, it was clear that the others knew, and Pfuel himself felt, that his fall was at hand. And despite his self-confidence and grumpy German sarcasm he was pitiable, with his hair smoothly brushed on the temples and sticking up in tufts behind. Though he concealed the fact under a show of irritation and contempt, he was evidently in despair that the sole remaining chance of verifying his theory by a huge experiment and proving its soundness to the whole world was slipping away from him.\n\nThe discussions continued a long time, and the longer they lasted the more heated became the disputes, culminating in shouts and personalities, and the less was it possible to arrive at any general conclusion from all that had been said. Prince Andrew, listening to this polyglot talk and to these surmises, plans, refutations, and shouts, felt nothing but amazement at what they were saying. A thought that had long since and often occurred to him during his military activities\u2014the idea that there is not and cannot be any science of war, and that therefore there can be no such thing as a military genius\u2014now appeared to him an obvious truth. \u201cWhat theory and science is possible about a matter the conditions and circumstances of which are unknown and cannot be defined, especially when the strength of the acting forces cannot be ascertained? No one was or is able to foresee in what condition our or the enemy\u2019s armies will be in a day\u2019s time, and no one can gauge the force of this or that detachment. Sometimes\u2014when there is not a coward at the front to shout, \u2018We are cut off!\u2019 and start running, but a brave and jolly lad who shouts, \u2018Hurrah!\u2019\u2014a detachment of five thousand is worth thirty thousand, as at Sch\u00f6n Grabern, while at times fifty thousand run from eight thousand, as at Austerlitz. What science can there be in a matter in which, as in all practical matters, nothing can be defined and everything depends on innumerable conditions, the significance of which is determined at a particular moment which arrives no one knows when? Armfeldt says our army is cut in half, and Paulucci says we have got the French army between two fires; Michaud says that the worthlessness of the Drissa camp lies in having the river behind it, and Pfuel says that is what constitutes its strength; Toll proposes one plan, Armfeldt another, and they are all good and all bad, and the advantages of any suggestions can be seen only at the moment of trial. And why do they all speak of a \u2018military genius\u2019? Is a man a genius who can order bread to be brought up at the right time and say who is to go to the right and who to the left? It is only because military men are invested with pomp and power and crowds of sychophants flatter power, attributing to it qualities of genius it does not possess. The best generals I have known were, on the contrary, stupid or absent-minded men. Bagrati\u00f3n was the best, Napoleon himself admitted that. And of Bonaparte himself! I remember his limited, self-satisfied face on the field of Austerlitz. Not only does a good army commander not need any special qualities, on the contrary he needs the absence of the highest and best human attributes\u2014love, poetry, tenderness, and philosophic inquiring doubt. He should be limited, firmly convinced that what he is doing is very important (otherwise he will not have sufficient patience), and only then will he be a brave leader. God forbid that he should be humane, should love, or pity, or think of what is just and unjust. It is understandable that a theory of their \u2018genius\u2019 was invented for them long ago because they have power! The success of a military action depends not on them, but on the man in the ranks who shouts, \u2018We are lost!\u2019 or who shouts, \u2018Hurrah!\u2019 And only in the ranks can one serve with assurance of being useful.\u201d\n\nSo thought Prince Andrew as he listened to the talking, and he roused himself only when Paulucci called him and everyone was leaving.\n\nAt the review next day the Emperor asked Prince Andrew where he would like to serve, and Prince Andrew lost his standing in court circles forever by not asking to remain attached to the sovereign\u2019s person, but for permission to serve in the army.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nBefore the beginning of the campaign, Rost\u00f3v had received a letter from his parents in which they told him briefly of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness and the breaking off of her engagement to Prince Andrew (which they explained by Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s having rejected him) and again asked Nicholas to retire from the army and return home. On receiving this letter, Nicholas did not even make any attempt to get leave of absence or to retire from the army, but wrote to his parents that he was sorry Nat\u00e1sha was ill and her engagement broken off, and that he would do all he could to meet their wishes. To S\u00f3nya he wrote separately.\n\n\u201cAdored friend of my soul!\u201d he wrote. \u201cNothing but honor could keep me from returning to the country. But now, at the commencement of the campaign, I should feel dishonored, not only in my comrades\u2019 eyes but in my own, if I preferred my own happiness to my love and duty to the Fatherland. But this shall be our last separation. Believe me, directly the war is over, if I am still alive and still loved by you, I will throw up everything and fly to you, to press you forever to my ardent breast.\u201d\n\nIt was, in fact, only the commencement of the campaign that prevented Rost\u00f3v from returning home as he had promised and marrying S\u00f3nya. The autumn in Otr\u00e1dnoe with the hunting, and the winter with the Christmas holidays and S\u00f3nya\u2019s love, had opened out to him a vista of tranquil rural joys and peace such as he had never known before, and which now allured him. \u201cA splendid wife, children, a good pack of hounds, a dozen leashes of smart borzois, agriculture, neighbors, service by election...\u201d thought he. But now the campaign was beginning, and he had to remain with his regiment. And since it had to be so, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v, as was natural to him, felt contented with the life he led in the regiment and was able to find pleasure in that life.\n\nOn his return from his furlough Nicholas, having been joyfully welcomed by his comrades, was sent to obtain remounts and brought back from the Ukraine excellent horses which pleased him and earned him commendation from his commanders. During his absence he had been promoted captain, and when the regiment was put on war footing with an increase in numbers, he was again allotted his old squadron.\n\nThe campaign began, the regiment was moved into Poland on double pay, new officers arrived, new men and horses, and above all everybody was infected with the merrily excited mood that goes with the commencement of a war, and Rost\u00f3v, conscious of his advantageous position in the regiment, devoted himself entirely to the pleasures and interests of military service, though he knew that sooner or later he would have to relinquish them.\n\nThe troops retired from V\u00edlna for various complicated reasons of state, political and strategic. Each step of the retreat was accompanied by a complicated interplay of interests, arguments, and passions at headquarters. For the P\u00e1vlograd hussars, however, the whole of this retreat during the finest period of summer and with sufficient supplies was a very simple and agreeable business.\n\nIt was only at headquarters that there was depression, uneasiness, and intriguing; in the body of the army they did not ask themselves where they were going or why. If they regretted having to retreat, it was only because they had to leave billets they had grown accustomed to, or some pretty young Polish lady. If the thought that things looked bad chanced to enter anyone\u2019s head, he tried to be as cheerful as befits a good soldier and not to think of the general trend of affairs, but only of the task nearest to hand. First they camped gaily before V\u00edlna, making acquaintance with the Polish landowners, preparing for reviews and being reviewed by the Emperor and other high commanders. Then came an order to retreat to Sventsy\u00e1ni and destroy any provisions they could not carry away with them. Sventsy\u00e1ni was remembered by the hussars only as the drunken camp, a name the whole army gave to their encampment there, and because many complaints were made against the troops, who, taking advantage of the order to collect provisions, took also horses, carriages, and carpets from the Polish proprietors. Rost\u00f3v remembered Sventsy\u00e1ni, because on the first day of their arrival at that small town he changed his sergeant major and was unable to manage all the drunken men of his squadron who, unknown to him, had appropriated five barrels of old beer. From Sventsy\u00e1ni they retired farther and farther to Drissa, and thence again beyond Drissa, drawing near to the frontier of Russia proper.\n\nOn the thirteenth of July the P\u00e1vlograds took part in a serious action for the first time.\n\nOn the twelfth of July, on the eve of that action, there was a heavy storm of rain and hail. In general, the summer of 1812 was remarkable for its storms.\n\nThe two P\u00e1vlograd squadrons were bivouacking on a field of rye, which was already in ear but had been completely trodden down by cattle and horses. The rain was descending in torrents, and Rost\u00f3v, with a young officer named Ily\u00edn, his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, was sitting in a hastily constructed shelter. An officer of their regiment, with long mustaches extending onto his cheeks, who after riding to the staff had been overtaken by the rain, entered Rost\u00f3v\u2019s shelter.\n\n\u201cI have come from the staff, Count. Have you heard of Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s exploit?\u201d\n\nAnd the officer gave them details of the Salt\u00e1nov battle, which he had heard at the staff.\n\nRost\u00f3v, smoking his pipe and turning his head about as the water trickled down his neck, listened inattentively, with an occasional glance at Ily\u00edn, who was pressing close to him. This officer, a lad of sixteen who had recently joined the regiment, was now in the same relation to Nicholas that Nicholas had been to Den\u00edsov seven years before. Ily\u00edn tried to imitate Rost\u00f3v in everything and adored him as a girl might have done.\n\nZdrzhinski, the officer with the long mustache, spoke grandiloquently of the Salt\u00e1nov dam being \u201ca Russian Thermopylae,\u201d and of how a deed worthy of antiquity had been performed by General Ra\u00e9vski. He recounted how Ra\u00e9vski had led his two sons onto the dam under terrific fire and had charged with them beside him. Rost\u00f3v heard the story and not only said nothing to encourage Zdrzhinski\u2019s enthusiasm but, on the contrary, looked like a man ashamed of what he was hearing, though with no intention of contradicting it. Since the campaigns of Austerlitz and of 1807 Rost\u00f3v knew by experience that men always lie when describing military exploits, as he himself had done when recounting them; besides that, he had experience enough to know that nothing happens in war at all as we can imagine or relate it. And so he did not like Zdrzhinski\u2019s tale, nor did he like Zdrzhinski himself who, with his mustaches extending over his cheeks, bent low over the face of his hearer, as was his habit, and crowded Rost\u00f3v in the narrow shanty. Rost\u00f3v looked at him in silence. \u201cIn the first place, there must have been such a confusion and crowding on the dam that was being attacked that if Ra\u00e9vski did lead his sons there, it could have had no effect except perhaps on some dozen men nearest to him,\u201d thought he, \u201cthe rest could not have seen how or with whom Ra\u00e9vski came onto the dam. And even those who did see it would not have been much stimulated by it, for what had they to do with Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s tender paternal feelings when their own skins were in danger? And besides, the fate of the Fatherland did not depend on whether they took the Salt\u00e1nov dam or not, as we are told was the case at Thermopylae. So why should he have made such a sacrifice? And why expose his own children in the battle? I would not have taken my brother P\u00e9tya there, or even Ily\u00edn, who\u2019s a stranger to me but a nice lad, but would have tried to put them somewhere under cover,\u201d Nicholas continued to think, as he listened to Zdrzhinski. But he did not express his thoughts, for in such matters, too, he had gained experience. He knew that this tale redounded to the glory of our arms and so one had to pretend not to doubt it. And he acted accordingly.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t stand this any more,\u201d said Ily\u00edn, noticing that Rost\u00f3v did not relish Zdrzhinski\u2019s conversation. \u201cMy stockings and shirt... and the water is running on my seat! I\u2019ll go and look for shelter. The rain seems less heavy.\u201d\n\nIly\u00edn went out and Zdrzhinski rode away.\n\nFive minutes later Ily\u00edn, splashing through the mud, came running back to the shanty.\n\n\u201cHurrah! Rost\u00f3v, come quick! I\u2019ve found it! About two hundred yards away there\u2019s a tavern where ours have already gathered. We can at least get dry there, and Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna\u2019s there.\u201d\n\nMary Hendr\u00edkhovna was the wife of the regimental doctor, a pretty young German woman he had married in Poland. The doctor, whether from lack of means or because he did not like to part from his young wife in the early days of their marriage, took her about with him wherever the hussar regiment went and his jealousy had become a standing joke among the hussar officers.\n\nRost\u00f3v threw his cloak over his shoulders, shouted to Lavr\u00fashka to follow with the things, and\u2014now slipping in the mud, now splashing right through it\u2014set off with Ily\u00edn in the lessening rain and the darkness that was occasionally rent by distant lightning.\n\n\u201cRost\u00f3v, where are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cHere. What lightning!\u201d they called to one another.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn the tavern, before which stood the doctor\u2019s covered cart, there were already some five officers. Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna, a plump little blonde German, in a dressing jacket and nightcap, was sitting on a broad bench in the front corner. Her husband, the doctor, lay asleep behind her. Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn, on entering the room, were welcomed with merry shouts and laughter.\n\n\u201cDear me, how jolly we are!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v laughing.\n\n\u201cAnd why do you stand there gaping?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat swells they are! Why, the water streams from them! Don\u2019t make our drawing room so wet.\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mess Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna\u2019s dress!\u201d cried other voices.\n\nRost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn hastened to find a corner where they could change into dry clothes without offending Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna\u2019s modesty. They were going into a tiny recess behind a partition to change, but found it completely filled by three officers who sat playing cards by the light of a solitary candle on an empty box, and these officers would on no account yield their position. Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna obliged them with the loan of a petticoat to be used as a curtain, and behind that screen Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn, helped by Lavr\u00fashka who had brought their kits, changed their wet things for dry ones.\n\nA fire was made up in the dilapidated brick stove. A board was found, fixed on two saddles and covered with a horsecloth, a small samovar was produced and a cellaret and half a bottle of rum, and having asked Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna to preside, they all crowded round her. One offered her a clean handkerchief to wipe her charming hands, another spread a jacket under her little feet to keep them from the damp, another hung his coat over the window to keep out the draft, and yet another waved the flies off her husband\u2019s face, lest he should wake up.\n\n\u201cLeave him alone,\u201d said Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna, smiling timidly and happily. \u201cHe is sleeping well as it is, after a sleepless night.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no, Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna,\u201d replied the officer, \u201cone must look after the doctor. Perhaps he\u2019ll take pity on me someday, when it comes to cutting off a leg or an arm for me.\u201d\n\nThere were only three tumblers, the water was so muddy that one could not make out whether the tea was strong or weak, and the samovar held only six tumblers of water, but this made it all the pleasanter to take turns in order of seniority to receive one\u2019s tumbler from Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna\u2019s plump little hands with their short and not overclean nails. All the officers appeared to be, and really were, in love with her that evening. Even those playing cards behind the partition soon left their game and came over to the samovar, yielding to the general mood of courting Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna. She, seeing herself surrounded by such brilliant and polite young men, beamed with satisfaction, try as she might to hide it, and perturbed as she evidently was each time her husband moved in his sleep behind her.\n\nThere was only one spoon, sugar was more plentiful than anything else, but it took too long to dissolve, so it was decided that Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna should stir the sugar for everyone in turn. Rost\u00f3v received his tumbler, and adding some rum to it asked Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna to stir it.\n\n\u201cBut you take it without sugar?\u201d she said, smiling all the time, as if everything she said and everything the others said was very amusing and had a double meaning.\n\n\u201cIt is not the sugar I want, but only that your little hand should stir my tea.\u201d\n\nMary Hendr\u00edkhovna assented and began looking for the spoon which someone meanwhile had pounced on.\n\n\u201cUse your finger, Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna, it will be still nicer,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cToo hot!\u201d she replied, blushing with pleasure.\n\nIly\u00edn put a few drops of rum into the bucket of water and brought it to Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna, asking her to stir it with her finger.\n\n\u201cThis is my cup,\u201d said he. \u201cOnly dip your finger in it and I\u2019ll drink it all up.\u201d\n\nWhen they had emptied the samovar, Rost\u00f3v took a pack of cards and proposed that they should play \u201cKings\u201d with Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna. They drew lots to settle who should make up her set. At Rost\u00f3v\u2019s suggestion it was agreed that whoever became \u201cKing\u201d should have the right to kiss Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna\u2019s hand, and that the \u201cBooby\u201d should go to refill and reheat the samovar for the doctor when the latter awoke.\n\n\u201cWell, but supposing Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna is \u2018King\u2019?\u201d asked Ily\u00edn.\n\n\u201cAs it is, she is Queen, and her word is law!\u201d\n\nThey had hardly begun to play before the doctor\u2019s disheveled head suddenly appeared from behind Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna. He had been awake for some time, listening to what was being said, and evidently found nothing entertaining or amusing in what was going on. His face was sad and depressed. Without greeting the officers, he scratched himself and asked to be allowed to pass as they were blocking the way. As soon as he had left the room all the officers burst into loud laughter and Mary Hendr\u00edkhovna blushed till her eyes filled with tears and thereby became still more attractive to them. Returning from the yard, the doctor told his wife (who had ceased to smile so happily, and looked at him in alarm, awaiting her sentence) that the rain had ceased and they must go to sleep in their covered cart, or everything in it would be stolen.\n\n\u201cBut I\u2019ll send an orderly.... Two of them!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cWhat an idea, doctor!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stand guard on it myself!\u201d said Ily\u00edn.\n\n\u201cNo, gentlemen, you have had your sleep, but I have not slept for two nights,\u201d replied the doctor, and he sat down morosely beside his wife, waiting for the game to end.\n\nSeeing his gloomy face as he frowned at his wife, the officers grew still merrier, and some of them could not refrain from laughter, for which they hurriedly sought plausible pretexts. When he had gone, taking his wife with him, and had settled down with her in their covered cart, the officers lay down in the tavern, covering themselves with their wet cloaks, but they did not sleep for a long time; now they exchanged remarks, recalling the doctor\u2019s uneasiness and his wife\u2019s delight, now they ran out into the porch and reported what was taking place in the covered trap. Several times Rost\u00f3v, covering his head, tried to go to sleep, but some remark would arouse him and conversation would be resumed, to the accompaniment of unreasoning, merry, childlike laughter.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIt was nearly three o\u2019clock but no one was yet asleep, when the quartermaster appeared with an order to move on to the little town of Ostr\u00f3vna. Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar. But Rost\u00f3v went off to his squadron without waiting for tea. Day was breaking, the rain had ceased, and the clouds were dispersing. It felt damp and cold, especially in clothes that were still moist. As they left the tavern in the twilight of the dawn, Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn both glanced under the wet and glistening leather hood of the doctor\u2019s cart, from under the apron of which his feet were sticking out, and in the middle of which his wife\u2019s nightcap was visible and her sleepy breathing audible.\n\n\u201cShe really is a dear little thing,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v to Ily\u00edn, who was following him.\n\n\u201cA charming woman!\u201d said Ily\u00edn, with all the gravity of a boy of sixteen.\n\nHalf an hour later the squadron was lined up on the road. The command was heard to \u201cmount\u201d and the soldiers crossed themselves and mounted. Rost\u00f3v riding in front gave the order \u201cForward!\u201d and the hussars, with clanking sabers and subdued talk, their horses\u2019 hoofs splashing in the mud, defiled in fours and moved along the broad road planted with birch trees on each side, following the infantry and a battery that had gone on in front.\n\nTattered, blue-purple clouds, reddening in the east, were scudding before the wind. It was growing lighter and lighter. That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night\u2019s rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side. The soldiers\u2019 faces were more and more clearly visible. Rost\u00f3v, always closely followed by Ily\u00edn, rode along the side of the road between two rows of birch trees.\n\nWhen campaigning, Rost\u00f3v allowed himself the indulgence of riding not a regimental but a Cossack horse. A judge of horses and a sportsman, he had lately procured himself a large, fine, mettlesome, Don\u00e9ts horse, dun-colored, with light mane and tail, and when he rode it no one could outgallop him. To ride this horse was a pleasure to him, and he thought of the horse, of the morning, of the doctor\u2019s wife, but not once of the impending danger.\n\nFormerly, when going into action, Rost\u00f3v had felt afraid; now he had not the least feeling of fear. He was fearless, not because he had grown used to being under fire (one cannot grow used to danger), but because he had learned how to manage his thoughts when in danger. He had grown accustomed when going into action to think about anything but what would seem most likely to interest him\u2014the impending danger. During the first period of his service, hard as he tried and much as he reproached himself with cowardice, he had not been able to do this, but with time it had come of itself. Now he rode beside Ily\u00edn under the birch trees, occasionally plucking leaves from a branch that met his hand, sometimes touching his horse\u2019s side with his foot, or, without turning round, handing a pipe he had finished to an hussar riding behind him, with as calm and careless an air as though he were merely out for a ride. He glanced with pity at the excited face of Ily\u00edn, who talked much and in great agitation. He knew from experience the tormenting expectation of terror and death the cornet was suffering and knew that only time could help him.\n\nAs soon as the sun appeared in a clear strip of sky beneath the clouds, the wind fell, as if it dared not spoil the beauty of the summer morning after the storm; drops still continued to fall, but vertically now, and all was still. The whole sun appeared on the horizon and disappeared behind a long narrow cloud that hung above it. A few minutes later it reappeared brighter still from behind the top of the cloud, tearing its edge. Everything grew bright and glittered. And with that light, and as if in reply to it, came the sound of guns ahead of them.\n\nBefore Rost\u00f3v had had time to consider and determine the distance of that firing, Count Ostermann-Tolst\u00f3y\u2019s adjutant came galloping from V\u00edtebsk with orders to advance at a trot along the road.\n\nThe squadron overtook and passed the infantry and the battery\u2014which had also quickened their pace\u2014rode down a hill, and passing through an empty and deserted village again ascended. The horses began to lather and the men to flush.\n\n\u201cHalt! Dress your ranks!\u201d the order of the regimental commander was heard ahead. \u201cForward by the left. Walk, march!\u201d came the order from in front.\n\nAnd the hussars, passing along the line of troops on the left flank of our position, halted behind our Uhlans who were in the front line. To the right stood our infantry in a dense column: they were the reserve. Higher up the hill, on the very horizon, our guns were visible through the wonderfully clear air, brightly illuminated by slanting morning sunbeams. In front, beyond a hollow dale, could be seen the enemy\u2019s columns and guns. Our advanced line, already in action, could be heard briskly exchanging shots with the enemy in the dale.\n\nAt these sounds, long unheard, Rost\u00f3v\u2019s spirits rose, as at the strains of the merriest music. Trap-ta-ta-tap! cracked the shots, now together, now several quickly one after another. Again all was silent and then again it sounded as if someone were walking on detonators and exploding them.\n\nThe hussars remained in the same place for about an hour. A cannonade began. Count Ostermann with his suite rode up behind the squadron, halted, spoke to the commander of the", "sequence": 16}, {"offset": 1700000, "text": " regiment, and rode up the hill to the guns.\n\nAfter Ostermann had gone, a command rang out to the Uhlans.\n\n\u201cForm column! Prepare to charge!\u201d\n\nThe infantry in front of them parted into platoons to allow the cavalry to pass. The Uhlans started, the streamers on their spears fluttering, and trotted downhill toward the French cavalry which was seen below to the left.\n\nAs soon as the Uhlans descended the hill, the hussars were ordered up the hill to support the battery. As they took the places vacated by the Uhlans, bullets came from the front, whining and whistling, but fell spent without taking effect.\n\nThe sounds, which he had not heard for so long, had an even more pleasurable and exhilarating effect on Rost\u00f3v than the previous sounds of firing. Drawing himself up, he viewed the field of battle opening out before him from the hill, and with his whole soul followed the movement of the Uhlans. They swooped down close to the French dragoons, something confused happened there amid the smoke, and five minutes later our Uhlans were galloping back, not to the place they had occupied but more to the left, and among the orange-colored Uhlans on chestnut horses and behind them, in a large group, blue French dragoons on gray horses could be seen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nRost\u00f3v, with his keen sportsman\u2019s eye, was one of the first to catch sight of these blue French dragoons pursuing our Uhlans. Nearer and nearer in disorderly crowds came the Uhlans and the French dragoons pursuing them. He could already see how these men, who looked so small at the foot of the hill, jostled and overtook one another, waving their arms and their sabers in the air.\n\nRost\u00f3v gazed at what was happening before him as at a hunt. He felt instinctively that if the hussars struck at the French dragoons now, the latter could not withstand them, but if a charge was to be made it must be done now, at that very moment, or it would be too late. He looked around. A captain, standing beside him, was gazing like himself with eyes fixed on the cavalry below them.\n\n\u201cAndrew Sevasty\u00e1nych!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cYou know, we could crush them....\u201d\n\n\u201cA fine thing too!\u201d replied the captain, \u201cand really...\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v, without waiting to hear him out, touched his horse, galloped to the front of his squadron, and before he had time to finish giving the word of command, the whole squadron, sharing his feeling, was following him. Rost\u00f3v himself did not know how or why he did it. He acted as he did when hunting, without reflecting or considering. He saw the dragoons near and that they were galloping in disorder; he knew they could not withstand an attack\u2014knew there was only that moment and that if he let it slip it would not return. The bullets were whining and whistling so stimulatingly around him and his horse was so eager to go that he could not restrain himself. He touched his horse, gave the word of command, and immediately, hearing behind him the tramp of the horses of his deployed squadron, rode at full trot downhill toward the dragoons. Hardly had they reached the bottom of the hill before their pace instinctively changed to a gallop, which grew faster and faster as they drew nearer to our Uhlans and the French dragoons who galloped after them. The dragoons were now close at hand. On seeing the hussars, the foremost began to turn, while those behind began to halt. With the same feeling with which he had galloped across the path of a wolf, Rost\u00f3v gave rein to his Don\u00e9ts horse and galloped to intersect the path of the dragoons\u2019 disordered lines. One Uhlan stopped, another who was on foot flung himself to the ground to avoid being knocked over, and a riderless horse fell in among the hussars. Nearly all the French dragoons were galloping back. Rost\u00f3v, picking out one on a gray horse, dashed after him. On the way he came upon a bush, his gallant horse cleared it, and almost before he had righted himself in his saddle he saw that he would immediately overtake the enemy he had selected. That Frenchman, by his uniform an officer, was going at a gallop, crouching on his gray horse and urging it on with his saber. In another moment Rost\u00f3v\u2019s horse dashed its breast against the hindquarters of the officer\u2019s horse, almost knocking it over, and at the same instant Rost\u00f3v, without knowing why, raised his saber and struck the Frenchman with it.\n\nThe instant he had done this, all Rost\u00f3v\u2019s animation vanished. The officer fell, not so much from the blow\u2014which had but slightly cut his arm above the elbow\u2014as from the shock to his horse and from fright. Rost\u00f3v reined in his horse, and his eyes sought his foe to see whom he had vanquished. The French dragoon officer was hopping with one foot on the ground, the other being caught in the stirrup. His eyes, screwed up with fear as if he every moment expected another blow, gazed up at Rost\u00f3v with shrinking terror. His pale and mud-stained face\u2014fair and young, with a dimple in the chin and light-blue eyes\u2014was not an enemy\u2019s face at all suited to a battlefield, but a most ordinary, homelike face. Before Rost\u00f3v had decided what to do with him, the officer cried, \u201cI surrender!\u201d He hurriedly but vainly tried to get his foot out of the stirrup and did not remove his frightened blue eyes from Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face. Some hussars who galloped up disengaged his foot and helped him into the saddle. On all sides, the hussars were busy with the dragoons; one was wounded, but though his face was bleeding, he would not give up his horse; another was perched up behind an hussar with his arms round him; a third was being helped by an hussar to mount his horse. In front, the French infantry were firing as they ran. The hussars galloped hastily back with their prisoners. Rost\u00f3v galloped back with the rest, aware of an unpleasant feeling of depression in his heart. Something vague and confused, which he could not at all account for, had come over him with the capture of that officer and the blow he had dealt him.\n\nCount Ostermann-Tolst\u00f3y met the returning hussars, sent for Rost\u00f3v, thanked him, and said he would report his gallant deed to the Emperor and would recommend him for a St. George\u2019s Cross. When sent for by Count Ostermann, Rost\u00f3v, remembering that he had charged without orders, felt sure his commander was sending for him to punish him for breach of discipline. Ostermann\u2019s flattering words and promise of a reward should therefore have struck him all the more pleasantly, but he still felt that same vaguely disagreeable feeling of moral nausea. \u201cBut what on earth is worrying me?\u201d he asked himself as he rode back from the general. \u201cIly\u00edn? No, he\u2019s safe. Have I disgraced myself in any way? No, that\u2019s not it.\u201d Something else, resembling remorse, tormented him. \u201cYes, oh yes, that French officer with the dimple. And I remember how my arm paused when I raised it.\u201d\n\nRost\u00f3v saw the prisoners being led away and galloped after them to have a look at his Frenchman with the dimple on his chin. He was sitting in his foreign uniform on an hussar packhorse and looked anxiously about him. The sword cut on his arm could scarcely be called a wound. He glanced at Rost\u00f3v with a feigned smile and waved his hand in greeting. Rost\u00f3v still had the same indefinite feeling, as of shame.\n\nAll that day and the next his friends and comrades noticed that Rost\u00f3v, without being dull or angry, was silent, thoughtful, and preoccupied. He drank reluctantly, tried to remain alone, and kept turning something over in his mind.\n\nRost\u00f3v was always thinking about that brilliant exploit of his, which to his amazement had gained him the St. George\u2019s Cross and even given him a reputation for bravery, and there was something he could not at all understand. \u201cSo others are even more afraid than I am!\u201d he thought. \u201cSo that\u2019s all there is in what is called heroism! And did I do it for my country\u2019s sake? And how was he to blame, with his dimple and blue eyes? And how frightened he was! He thought that I should kill him. Why should I kill him? My hand trembled. And they have given me a St. George\u2019s Cross.... I can\u2019t make it out at all.\u201d\n\nBut while Nicholas was considering these questions and still could reach no clear solution of what puzzled him so, the wheel of fortune in the service, as often happens, turned in his favor. After the affair at Ostr\u00f3vna he was brought into notice, received command of an hussar battalion, and when a brave officer was needed he was chosen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nOn receiving news of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness, the countess, though not quite well yet and still weak, went to Moscow with P\u00e9tya and the rest of the household, and the whole family moved from M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s house to their own and settled down in town.\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness was so serious that, fortunately for her and for her parents, the consideration of all that had caused the illness, her conduct and the breaking off of her engagement, receded into the background. She was so ill that it was impossible for them to consider in how far she was to blame for what had happened. She could not eat or sleep, grew visibly thinner, coughed, and, as the doctors made them feel, was in danger. They could not think of anything but how to help her. Doctors came to see her singly and in consultation, talked much in French, German, and Latin, blamed one another, and prescribed a great variety of medicines for all the diseases known to them, but the simple idea never occurred to any of them that they could not know the disease Nat\u00e1sha was suffering from, as no disease suffered by a live man can be known, for every living person has his own peculiarities and always has his own peculiar, personal, novel, complicated disease, unknown to medicine\u2014not a disease of the lungs, liver, skin, heart, nerves, and so on mentioned in medical books, but a disease consisting of one of the innumerable combinations of the maladies of those organs. This simple thought could not occur to the doctors (as it cannot occur to a wizard that he is unable to work his charms) because the business of their lives was to cure, and they received money for it and had spent the best years of their lives on that business. But, above all, that thought was kept out of their minds by the fact that they saw they were really useful, as in fact they were to the whole Rost\u00f3v family. Their usefulness did not depend on making the patient swallow substances for the most part harmful (the harm was scarcely perceptible, as they were given in small doses), but they were useful, necessary, and indispensable because they satisfied a mental need of the invalid and of those who loved her\u2014and that is why there are, and always will be, pseudo-healers, wise women, homeopaths, and allopaths. They satisfied that eternal human need for hope of relief, for sympathy, and that something should be done, which is felt by those who are suffering. They satisfied the need seen in its most elementary form in a child, when it wants to have a place rubbed that has been hurt. A child knocks itself and runs at once to the arms of its mother or nurse to have the aching spot rubbed or kissed, and it feels better when this is done. The child cannot believe that the strongest and wisest of its people have no remedy for its pain, and the hope of relief and the expression of its mother\u2019s sympathy while she rubs the bump comforts it. The doctors were of use to Nat\u00e1sha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist\u2019s in the Arb\u00e1t and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.\n\nWhat would S\u00f3nya and the count and countess have done, how would they have looked, if nothing had been done, if there had not been those pills to give by the clock, the warm drinks, the chicken cutlets, and all the other details of life ordered by the doctors, the carrying out of which supplied an occupation and consolation to the family circle? How would the count have borne his dearly loved daughter\u2019s illness had he not known that it was costing him a thousand rubles, and that he would not grudge thousands more to benefit her, or had he not known that if her illness continued he would not grudge yet other thousands and would take her abroad for consultations there, and had he not been able to explain the details of how M\u00e9tivier and Feller had not understood the symptoms, but Frise had, and M\u00fadrov had diagnosed them even better? What would the countess have done had she not been able sometimes to scold the invalid for not strictly obeying the doctor\u2019s orders?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll never get well like that,\u201d she would say, forgetting her grief in her vexation, \u201cif you won\u2019t obey the doctor and take your medicine at the right time! You mustn\u2019t trifle with it, you know, or it may turn to pneumonia,\u201d she would go on, deriving much comfort from the utterance of that foreign word, incomprehensible to others as well as to herself.\n\nWhat would S\u00f3nya have done without the glad consciousness that she had not undressed during the first three nights, in order to be ready to carry out all the doctor\u2019s injunctions with precision, and that she still kept awake at night so as not to miss the proper time when the slightly harmful pills in the little gilt box had to be administered? Even to Nat\u00e1sha herself it was pleasant to see that so many sacrifices were being made for her sake, and to know that she had to take medicine at certain hours, though she declared that no medicine would cure her and that it was all nonsense. And it was even pleasant to be able to show, by disregarding the orders, that she did not believe in medical treatment and did not value her life.\n\nThe doctor came every day, felt her pulse, looked at her tongue, and regardless of her grief-stricken face joked with her. But when he had gone into another room, to which the countess hurriedly followed him, he assumed a grave air and thoughtfully shaking his head said that though there was danger, he had hopes of the effect of this last medicine and one must wait and see, that the malady was chiefly mental, but... And the countess, trying to conceal the action from herself and from him, slipped a gold coin into his hand and always returned to the patient with a more tranquil mind.\n\nThe symptoms of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s illness were that she ate little, slept little, coughed, and was always low-spirited. The doctors said that she could not get on without medical treatment, so they kept her in the stifling atmosphere of the town, and the Rost\u00f3vs did not move to the country that summer of 1812.\n\nIn spite of the many pills she swallowed and the drops and powders out of the little bottles and boxes of which Madame Schoss who was fond of such things made a large collection, and in spite of being deprived of the country life to which she was accustomed, youth prevailed. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s grief began to be overlaid by the impressions of daily life, it ceased to press so painfully on her heart, it gradually faded into the past, and she began to recover physically.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nNat\u00e1sha was calmer but no happier. She not merely avoided all external forms of pleasure\u2014balls, promenades, concerts, and theaters\u2014but she never laughed without a sound of tears in her laughter. She could not sing. As soon as she began to laugh, or tried to sing by herself, tears choked her: tears of remorse, tears at the recollection of those pure times which could never return, tears of vexation that she should so uselessly have ruined her young life which might have been so happy. Laughter and singing in particular seemed to her like a blasphemy, in face of her sorrow. Without any need of self-restraint, no wish to coquet ever entered her head. She said and felt at that time that no man was more to her than Nast\u00e1sya Iv\u00e1novna, the buffoon. Something stood sentinel within her and forbade her every joy. Besides, she had lost all the old interests of her carefree girlish life that had been so full of hope. The previous autumn, the hunting, \u201cUncle,\u201d and the Christmas holidays spent with Nicholas at Otr\u00e1dnoe were what she recalled oftenest and most painfully. What would she not have given to bring back even a single day of that time! But it was gone forever. Her presentiment at the time had not deceived her\u2014that that state of freedom and readiness for any enjoyment would not return again. Yet it was necessary to live on.\n\nIt comforted her to reflect that she was not better as she had formerly imagined, but worse, much worse, than anybody else in the world. But this was not enough. She knew that, and asked herself, \u201cWhat next?\u201d But there was nothing to come. There was no joy in life, yet life was passing. Nat\u00e1sha apparently tried not to be a burden or a hindrance to anyone, but wanted nothing for herself. She kept away from everyone in the house and felt at ease only with her brother P\u00e9tya. She liked to be with him better than with the others, and when alone with him she sometimes laughed. She hardly ever left the house and of those who came to see them was glad to see only one person, Pierre. It would have been impossible to treat her with more delicacy, greater care, and at the same time more seriously than did Count Bez\u00fakhov. Nat\u00e1sha unconsciously felt this delicacy and so found great pleasure in his society. But she was not even grateful to him for it; nothing good on Pierre\u2019s part seemed to her to be an effort, it seemed so natural for him to be kind to everyone that there was no merit in his kindness. Sometimes Nat\u00e1sha noticed embarrassment and awkwardness on his part in her presence, especially when he wanted to do something to please her, or feared that something they spoke of would awaken memories distressing to her. She noticed this and attributed it to his general kindness and shyness, which she imagined must be the same toward everyone as it was to her. After those involuntary words\u2014that if he were free he would have asked on his knees for her hand and her love\u2014uttered at a moment when she was so strongly agitated, Pierre never spoke to Nat\u00e1sha of his feelings; and it seemed plain to her that those words, which had then so comforted her, were spoken as all sorts of meaningless words are spoken to comfort a crying child. It was not because Pierre was a married man, but because Nat\u00e1sha felt very strongly with him that moral barrier the absence of which she had experienced with Kur\u00e1gin that it never entered her head that the relations between him and herself could lead to love on her part, still less on his, or even to the kind of tender, self-conscious, romantic friendship between a man and a woman of which she had known several instances.\n\nBefore the end of the fast of St. Peter, Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna Bel\u00f3va, a country neighbor of the Rost\u00f3vs, came to Moscow to pay her devotions at the shrines of the Moscow saints. She suggested that Nat\u00e1sha should fast and prepare for Holy Communion, and Nat\u00e1sha gladly welcomed the idea. Despite the doctor\u2019s orders that she should not go out early in the morning, Nat\u00e1sha insisted on fasting and preparing for the sacrament, not as they generally prepared for it in the Rost\u00f3v family by attending three services in their own house, but as Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna did, by going to church every day for a week and not once missing Vespers, Matins, or Mass.\n\nThe countess was pleased with Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s zeal; after the poor results of the medical treatment, in the depths of her heart she hoped that prayer might help her daughter more than medicines and, though not without fear and concealing it from the doctor, she agreed to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s wish and entrusted her to Bel\u00f3va. Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna used to come to wake Nat\u00e1sha at three in the morning, but generally found her already awake. She was afraid of being late for Matins. Hastily washing, and meekly putting on her shabbiest dress and an old mantilla, Nat\u00e1sha, shivering in the fresh air, went out into the deserted streets lit by the clear light of dawn. By Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna\u2019s advice Nat\u00e1sha prepared herself not in their own parish, but at a church where, according to the devout Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna, the priest was a man of very severe and lofty life. There were never many people in the church; Nat\u00e1sha always stood beside Bel\u00f3va in the customary place before an icon of the Blessed Virgin, let into the screen before the choir on the left side, and a feeling, new to her, of humility before something great and incomprehensible, seized her when at that unusual morning hour, gazing at the dark face of the Virgin illuminated by the candles burning before it and by the morning light falling from the window, she listened to the words of the service which she tried to follow with understanding. When she understood them her personal feeling became interwoven in the prayers with shades of its own. When she did not understand, it was sweeter still to think that the wish to understand everything is pride, that it is impossible to understand all, that it is only necessary to believe and to commit oneself to God, whom she felt guiding her soul at those moments. She crossed herself, bowed low, and when she did not understand, in horror at her own vileness, simply asked God to forgive her everything, everything, to have mercy upon her. The prayers to which she surrendered herself most of all were those of repentance. On her way home at an early hour when she met no one but bricklayers going to work or men sweeping the street, and everybody within the houses was still asleep, Nat\u00e1sha experienced a feeling new to her, a sense of the possibility of correcting her faults, the possibility of a new, clean life, and of happiness.\n\nDuring the whole week she spent in this way, that feeling grew every day. And the happiness of taking communion, or \u201ccommuning\u201d as Agraf\u00e9na Iv\u00e1novna, joyously playing with the word, called it, seemed to Nat\u00e1sha so great that she felt she should never live till that blessed Sunday.\n\nBut the happy day came, and on that memorable Sunday, when, dressed in white muslin, she returned home after communion, for the first time for many months she felt calm and not oppressed by the thought of the life that lay before her.\n\nThe doctor who came to see her that day ordered her to continue the powders he had prescribed a fortnight previously.\n\n\u201cShe must certainly go on taking them morning and evening,\u201d said he, evidently sincerely satisfied with his success. \u201cOnly, please be particular about it.\n\n\u201cBe quite easy,\u201d he continued playfully, as he adroitly took the gold coin in his palm. \u201cShe will soon be singing and frolicking about. The last medicine has done her a very great deal of good. She has freshened up very much.\u201d\n\nThe countess, with a cheerful expression on her face, looked down at her nails and spat a little for luck as she returned to the drawing room.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nAt the beginning of July more and more disquieting reports about the war began to spread in Moscow; people spoke of an appeal by the Emperor to the people, and of his coming himself from the army to Moscow. And as up to the eleventh of July no manifesto or appeal had been received, exaggerated reports became current about them and about the position of Russia. It was said that the Emperor was leaving the army because it was in danger, it was said that Smol\u00e9nsk had surrendered, that Napoleon had an army of a million and only a miracle could save Russia.\n\nOn the eleventh of July, which was Saturday, the manifesto was received but was not yet in print, and Pierre, who was at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, promised to come to dinner next day, Sunday, and bring a copy of the manifesto and appeal, which he would obtain from Count Rostopch\u00edn.\n\nThat Sunday, the Rost\u00f3vs went to Mass at the Razum\u00f3vskis\u2019 private chapel as usual. It was a hot July day. Even at ten o\u2019clock, when the Rost\u00f3vs got out of their carriage at the chapel, the sultry air, the shouts of hawkers, the light and gay summer clothes of the crowd, the dusty leaves of the trees on the boulevard, the sounds of the band and the white trousers of a battalion marching to parade, the rattling of wheels on the cobblestones, and the brilliant, hot sunshine were all full of that summer languor, that content and discontent with the present, which is most strongly felt on a bright, hot day in town. All the Moscow notabilities, all the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 acquaintances, were at the Razum\u00f3vskis\u2019 chapel, for, as if expecting something to happen, many wealthy families who usually left town for their country estates had not gone away that summer. As Nat\u00e1sha, at her mother\u2019s side, passed through the crowd behind a liveried footman who cleared the way for them, she heard a young man speaking about her in too loud a whisper.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Rost\u00f3va, the one who...\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s much thinner, but all the same she\u2019s pretty!\u201d\n\nShe heard, or thought she heard, the names of Kur\u00e1gin and Bolk\u00f3nski. But she was always imagining that. It always seemed to her that everyone who looked at her was thinking only of what had happened to her. With a sinking heart, wretched as she always was now when she found herself in a crowd, Nat\u00e1sha in her lilac silk dress trimmed with black lace walked\u2014as women can walk\u2014with the more repose and stateliness the greater the pain and shame in her soul. She knew for certain that she was pretty, but this no longer gave her satisfaction as it used to. On the contrary it tormented her more than anything else of late, and particularly so on this bright, hot summer day in town. \u201cIt\u2019s Sunday again\u2014another week past,\u201d she thought, recalling that she had been here the Sunday before, \u201cand always the same life that is no life, and the same surroundings in which it used to be so easy to live. I\u2019m pretty, I\u2019m young, and I know that now I am good. I used to be bad, but now I know I am good,\u201d she thought, \u201cbut yet my best years are slipping by and are no good to anyone.\u201d She stood by her mother\u2019s side and exchanged nods with acquaintances near her. From habit she scrutinized the ladies\u2019 dresses, condemned the bearing of a lady standing close by who was not crossing herself properly but in a cramped manner, and again she thought with vexation that she was herself being judged and was judging others, and suddenly, at the sound of the service, she felt horrified at her own vileness, horrified that the former purity of her soul was again lost to her.\n\nA comely, fresh-looking old man was conducting the service with that mild solemnity which has so elevating and soothing an effect on the souls of the worshipers. The gates of the sanctuary screen were closed, the curtain was slowly drawn, and from behind it a soft mysterious voice pronounced some words. Tears, the cause of which she herself did not understand, made Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s breast heave, and a joyous but oppressive feeling agitated her.\n\n\u201cTeach me what I should do, how to live my life, how I may grow good forever, forever!\u201d she pleaded.\n\nThe deacon came out onto the raised space before the altar screen and, holding his thumb extended, drew his long hair from under his dalmatic and, making the sign of the cross on his breast, began in a loud and solemn voice to recite the words of the prayer....\n\n\u201cIn peace let us pray unto the Lord.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs one community, without distinction of class, without enmity, united by brotherly love\u2014let us pray!\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cFor the peace that is from above, and for the salvation of our souls.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor the world of angels and all the spirits who dwell above us,\u201d prayed Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nWhen they prayed for the warriors, she thought of her brother and Den\u00edsov. When they prayed for all traveling by land and sea, she remembered Prince Andrew, prayed for him, and asked God to forgive her all the wrongs she had done him. When they prayed for those who love us, she prayed for the members of her own family, her father and mother and S\u00f3nya, realizing for the first time how wrongly she had acted toward them, and feeling all the strength of her love for them. When they prayed for those who hate us, she tried to think of her enemies and people who hated her, in order to pray for them. She included among her enemies the creditors and all who had business dealings with her father, and always at the thought of enemies and those who hated her she remembered Anatole who had done her so much harm\u2014and though he did not hate her she gladly prayed for him as for an enemy. Only at prayer did she feel able to think clearly and calmly of Prince Andrew and Anatole, as men for whom her feelings were as nothing compared with her awe and devotion to God. When they prayed for the Imperial family and the Synod, she bowed very low and made the sign of the cross, saying to herself that even if she did not understand, still she could not doubt, and at any rate loved the governing Synod and prayed for it.\n\nWhen he had finished the Litany the deacon crossed the stole over his breast and said, \u201cLet us commit ourselves and our whole lives to Christ the Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cCommit ourselves to God,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha inwardly repeated. \u201cLord God, I submit myself to Thy will!\u201d she thought. \u201cI want nothing, wish for nothing; teach me what to do and how to use my will! Take me, take me!\u201d prayed Nat\u00e1sha, with impatient emotion in her heart, not crossing herself but letting her slender arms hang down as if expecting some invisible power at any moment to take her and deliver her from herself, from her regrets, desires, remorse, hopes, and sins.\n\nThe countess looked round several times at her daughter\u2019s softened face and shining eyes and prayed God to help her.\n\nUnexpectedly, in the middle of the service, and not in the usual order Nat\u00e1sha knew so well, the deacon brought out a small stool, the one he knelt on when praying on Trinity Sunday, and placed it before the doors of the sanctuary screen. The priest came out with his purple velvet biretta on his head, adjusted his hair, and knelt down with an effort. Everybody followed his example and they looked at one another in surprise. Then came the prayer just received from the Synod\u2014a prayer for the deliverance of Russia from hostile invasion.\n\n\u201cLord God of might, God of our salvation!\u201d began the priest in that voice, clear, not grandiloquent but mild, in which only the Slav clergy read and which acts so irresistibly on a Russian heart.\n\n\u201cLord God of might, God of our salvation! Look this day in mercy and blessing on Thy humble people, and graciously hear us, spare us, and have mercy upon us! This foe confounding Thy land, desiring to lay waste the whole world, rises against us; these lawless men are gathered together to overthrow Thy kingdom, to destroy Thy dear Jerusalem, Thy beloved Russia; to defile Thy temples, to overthrow Thine altars, and to desecrate our holy shrines. How long, O Lord, how long shall the wicked triumph? How long shall they wield unlawful power?\n\n\u201cLord God! Hear us when we pray to Thee; strengthen with Thy might our most gracious sovereign lord, the Emperor Alexander P\u00e1vlovich; be mindful of his uprightness and meekness, reward him according to his righteousness, and let it preserve us, Thy chosen Israel! Bless his counsels, his undertakings, and his work; strengthen his kingdom by Thine almighty hand, and give him victory over his enemy, even as Thou gavest Moses the victory over Amalek, Gideon over Midian, and David over Goliath. Preserve his army, put a bow of brass in the hands of those who have armed themselves in Thy Name, and gird their loins with strength for the fight. Take up the spear and shield and arise to help us; confound and put to shame those who have devised evil against us, may they be before the faces of Thy faithful warriors as dust before the wind, and may Thy mighty Angel confound them and put them to flight; may they be ensnared when they know it not, and may the plots they have laid in secret be turned against them; let them fall before Thy servants\u2019 feet and be laid low by our hosts! Lord, Thou art able to save both great and small; Thou art God, and man cannot prevail against Thee!\n\n\u201cGod of our fathers! Remember Thy bounteous mercy and loving-kindness which are from of old; turn not Thy face from us, but be gracious to our unworthiness, and in Thy great goodness and Thy many mercies regard not our transgressions and iniquities! Create in us a clean heart and renew a right spirit within us, strengthen us all in Thy faith, fortify our hope, inspire us with true love one for another, arm us with unity of spirit in the righteous defense of the heritage Thou gavest to us and to our fathers, and let not the scepter of the wicked be exalted against the destiny of those Thou hast sanctified.\n\n\u201cO Lord our God, in whom we believe and in whom we put our trust, let us not be confounded in our hope of Thy mercy, and give us a token of Thy blessing, that those who hate us and our Orthodox faith may see it and be put to shame and perish, and may all the nations know that Thou art the Lord and we are Thy people. Show Thy mercy upon us this day, O Lord, and grant us Thy salvation; make the hearts of Thy servants to rejoice in Thy mercy; smite down our enemies and destroy them swiftly beneath the feet of Thy faithful servants! For Thou art the defense, the succor, and the victory of them that put their trust in Thee, and to Thee be all glory, to Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, now and forever, world without end. Amen.\u201d\n\nIn Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s receptive condition of soul this prayer affected her strongly. She listened to every word about the victory of Moses over Amalek, of Gideon over Midian, and of David over Goliath, and about the destruction of \u201cThy Jerusalem,\u201d and she prayed to God with the tenderness and emotion with which her heart was overflowing, but without fully understanding what she was asking of God in that prayer. She shared with all her heart in the prayer for the spirit of righteousness, for the strengthening of the heart by faith and hope, and its animation by love. But she could not pray that her enemies might be trampled under foot when but a few minutes before she had been wishing she had more of them that she might pray for them. But neither could she doubt the righteousness of the prayer that was being read on bended knees. She felt in her heart a devout and tremulous awe at the thought of the punishment that overtakes men for their sins, and especially of her own sins, and she prayed to God to forgive them all, and her too, and to give them all, and her too, peace and happiness. And it seemed to her that God heard her prayer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nFrom the day when Pierre, after leaving the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 with Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s grateful look fresh in his mind, had gazed at the comet that seemed to be fixed in the sky and felt that something new was appearing on his own horizon\u2014from that day the problem of the vanity and uselessness of all earthly things, that had incessantly tormented him, no longer presented itself. That terrible question \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWherefore?\u201d which had come to him amid every occupation, was now replaced, not by another question or by a reply to the former question, but by her image. When he listened to, or himself took part in, trivial conversations, when he read or heard of human baseness or folly, he was not horrified as formerly, and did not ask himself why men struggled so about these things when all is so transient and incomprehensible\u2014but he remembered her as he had last seen her, and all his doubts vanished\u2014not because she had answered the questions that had haunted him, but because his conception of her transferred him instantly to another, a brighter, realm of spiritual activity in which no one could be justified or guilty\u2014a realm of beauty and love which it was worth living for. Whatever worldly baseness presented itself to him, he said to himself:\n\n\u201cWell, supposing N. N. has swindled the country and the Tsar, and the country and the Tsar confer honors upon him, what does that matter? She smiled at me yesterday and asked me to come again, and I love her, and no one will ever know it.\u201d And his soul felt calm and peaceful.\n\nPierre still went into society, drank as much and led the same idle and dissipated life, because besides the hours he spent at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 there were other hours he had to spend somehow, and the habits and acquaintances he had made in Moscow formed a current that bore him along irresistibly. But latterly, when more and more disquieting reports came from the seat of war and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s health began to improve and she no longer aroused in him the former feeling of careful pity, an ever-increasing restlessness, which he could not explain, took possession of him. He felt that the condition he was in could not continue long, that a catastrophe was coming which would change his whole life, and he impatiently sought everywhere for signs of that approaching catastrophe. One of his brother Masons had revealed to Pierre the following prophecy concerning Napoleon, drawn from the Revelation of St. John.\n\nIn chapter 13, verse 18, of the Apocalypse, it is said:\n\nHere is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his number is Six hundred threescore and six.\n\nAnd in the fifth verse of the same chapter:\n\nAnd there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty and two months.\n\n\nThe French alphabet, written out with the same numerical values as the Hebrew, in which the first nine letters denote units and the others tens, will have the following significance:\n\n\n      a   b   c   d   e   f   g   h   i   k\n      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10\n       l    m    n    o    p    q    r    s\n      20   30   40   50   60   70   80   90\n             t    u    v    w    x    y\n            100  110  120  130  140  150\n                        z\n                       160\n\n\nWriting the words L\u2019Empereur Napol\u00e9on in numbers, it appears that the sum of them is 666, and that Napoleon was therefore the beast foretold in the Apocalypse. Moreover, by applying the same system to the words quarante-deux, which was the term allowed to the beast that \u201cspoke great things and blasphemies,\u201d the same number 666 was obtained; from which it followed that the limit fixed for Napoleon\u2019s power had come in the year 1812 when the French emperor was forty-two. This prophecy pleased Pierre very much and he often asked himself what would put an end to the power of the beast, that is, of Napoleon, and tried by the same system of using letters as numbers and adding them up, to find an answer to the question that engrossed him. He wrote the words L\u2019Empereur Alexandre, La nation russe and added up their numbers, but the sums were either more or less than 666. Once when making such calculations he wrote down his own name in French, Comte Pierre Besouhoff, but the sum of the numbers did not come right. Then he changed the spelling, substituting a z for the s and adding de and the article le, still without obtaining the desired result. Then it occurred to him: if the answer to the question were contained in his name, his nationality would also be given in the answer. So he wrote Le russe Besuhof and adding up the numbers got 671. This was only five too much, and five was represented by e, the very letter elided from the article le before the word Empereur. By omitting the e, though incorrectly, Pierre got the answer he sought. L\u2019russe Besuhof made 666. This discovery excited him. How, or by what means, he was connected with the great event foretold in the Apocalypse he did not know, but he did not doubt that connection for a moment. His love for Nat\u00e1sha, Antichrist, Napoleon, the invasion, the comet, 666, L\u2019Empereur Napol\u00e9on, and L\u2019russe Besuhof\u2014all this had to mature and culminate, to lift him out of that spellbound, petty sphere of Moscow habits in which he felt himself held captive and lead him to a great achievement and great happiness.\n\nOn the eve of the Sunday when the special prayer was read, Pierre had promised the Rost\u00f3vs to bring them, from Count Rostopch\u00edn whom he knew well, both the appeal to the people and the news from the army. In the morning, when he went to call at Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s he met there a courier fresh from the army, an acquaintance of his own, who often danced at Moscow balls.\n\n\u201cDo, please, for heaven\u2019s sake, relieve me of something!\u201d said the courier. \u201cI have a sackful of letters to parents.\u201d\n\nAmong these letters was one from Nicholas Rost\u00f3v to his father. Pierre took that letter, and Rostopch\u00edn also gave him the Emperor\u2019s appeal to Moscow, which had just been printed, the last army orders, and his own most recent bulletin. Glancing through the army orders, Pierre found in one of them, in the lists of killed, wounded, and rewarded, the name of Nicholas Rost\u00f3v, awarded a St. George\u2019s Cross of the Fourth Class for courage shown in the Ostr\u00f3vna affair, and in the same order the name of Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski, appointed to the command of a regiment of Chasseurs. Though he did not want to remind the Rost\u00f3vs of Bolk\u00f3nski, Pierre could not refrain from making them happy by the news of their son\u2019s having received a decoration, so he sent that printed army order and Nicholas\u2019 letter to the Rost\u00f3vs, keeping the appeal, the bulletin, and the other orders to take with him when he went to dinner.\n\nHis conversation with Count Rostopch\u00edn and the latter\u2019s tone of anxious hurry, the meeting with the courier who talked casually of how badly things were going in the army, the rumors of the discovery of spies in Moscow and of a leaflet in circulation stating that Napoleon promised to be in both the Russian capitals by the autumn, and the talk of the Emperor\u2019s being expected to arrive next day\u2014all aroused with fresh force that feeling of agitation and expectation in Pierre which he had been conscious of ever since the appearance of the comet, and especially since the beginning of the war.\n\nHe had long been thinking of entering the army and would have done so had he not been hindered, first, by his membership of the Society of Freemasons to which he was bound by oath and which preached perpetual peace and the abolition of war, and secondly, by the fact that when he saw the great mass of Muscovites who had donned uniform and were talking patriotism, he somehow felt ashamed to take the step. But the chief reason for not carrying out his intention to enter the army lay in the vague idea that he was L\u2019russe Besuhof who had the number of the beast, 666; that his part in the great affair of setting a limit to the power of the beast that spoke great and blasphemous things had been predestined from eternity, and that therefore he ought not to undertake anything, but wait for what was bound to come to pass.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nA few intimate friends were dining with the Rost\u00f3vs that day, as usual on Sundays.\n\nPierre came early so as to find them alone.\n\nHe had grown so stout this year that he would have been abnormal had he not been so tall, so broad of limb, and so strong that he carried his bulk with evident ease.\n\nHe went up the stairs, puffing and muttering something. His coachman did not even ask whether he was to wait. He knew that when his master was at the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 he stayed till midnight. The Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 footman rushed eagerly forward to help him off with his cloak and take his hat and stick. Pierre, from club habit, always left both hat and stick in the anteroom.\n\nThe first person he saw in the house was Nat\u00e1sha. Even before he saw her, while taking off his cloak, he heard her. She was practicing solfa exercises in the music room. He knew that she had not sung since her illness, and so the sound of her voice surprised and delighted him. He opened the door softly and saw her, in the lilac dress she had worn at church, walking about the room singing. She had her back to him when he opened the door, but when, turning quickly, she saw his broad, surprised face, she blushed and came rapidly up to him.\n\n\u201cI want to try to sing again,\u201d she said, adding as if by way of excuse, \u201cit is, at least, something to do.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s capital!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow glad I am you\u2019ve come! I am so happy today,\u201d she said, with the old animation Pierre had not seen in her for a long time. \u201cYou know Nicholas has received a St. George\u2019s Cross? I am so proud of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I sent that announcement. But I don\u2019t want to interrupt you,\u201d he added, and was about to go to the drawing room.\n\nNat\u00e1sha stopped him.\n\n\u201cCount, is it wrong of me to sing?\u201d she said blushing, and fixing her eyes inquiringly on him.\n\n\u201cNo... Why should it be? On the contrary... But why do you ask me?\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know myself,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha answered quickly, \u201cbut I should not like to do anything you disapproved of. I believe in you completely. You don\u2019t know how important you are to me, how much you\u2019ve done for me....\u201d She spoke rapidly and did not notice how Pierre flushed at her words. \u201cI saw in that same army order that he, Bolk\u00f3nski\u201d (she whispered the name hastily), \u201cis in Russia, and in the army again. What do you think?\u201d\u2014she was speaking hurriedly, evidently afraid her strength might fail her\u2014\u201cWill he ever forgive me? Will he not always have a bitter feeling toward me? What do you think? What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI think...\u201d Pierre replied, \u201cthat he has nothing to forgive.... If I were in his place...\u201d\n\nBy association of ideas, Pierre was at once carried back to the day when, trying to comfort her, he had said that if he were not himself but the best man in the world and free, he would ask on his knees for her hand; and the same feeling of pity, tenderness, and love took possession of him and the same words rose to his lips. But she did not give him time to say them.\n\n\u201cYes, you... you...\u201d she said, uttering the word you rapturously\u2014\u201cthat\u2019s a different thing. I know no one kinder, more generous, or better than you; nobody could be! Had you not been there then, and now too, I don\u2019t know what would have become of me, because...\u201d\n\nTears suddenly rose in her eyes, she turned away, lifted her music before her eyes, began singing again, and again began walking up and down the room.\n\nJust then P\u00e9tya came running in from the drawing room.\n\nP\u00e9tya was now a handsome rosy lad of fifteen with full red lips and resembled Nat\u00e1sha. He was preparing to enter the university, but he and his friend Obol\u00e9nski had lately, in secret, agreed to join the hussars.\n\nP\u00e9tya had come rushing out to talk to his namesake about this affair. He had asked Pierre to find out whether he would be accepted in the hussars.\n\nPierre walked up and down the drawing room, not listening to what P\u00e9tya was saying.\n\nP\u00e9tya pulled him by the arm to attract his attention.\n\n\u201cWell, what about my plan? Peter Kir\u00edlych, for heaven\u2019s sake! You are my only hope,\u201d said P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cOh yes, your plan. To join the hussars? I\u2019ll mention it, I\u2019ll bring it all up today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, mon cher, have you got the manifesto?\u201d asked the old count. \u201cThe countess has been to Mass at the Razum\u00f3vskis\u2019 and heard the new prayer. She says it\u2019s very fine.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ve got it,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cThe Emperor is to be here tomorrow... there\u2019s to be an Extraordinary Meeting of the nobility, and they are talking of a levy of ten men per thousand. Oh yes, let me congratulate you!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, thank God! Well, and what news from the army?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are again retreating. They say we\u2019re already near Smol\u00e9nsk,\u201d replied Pierre.\n\n\u201cO Lord, O Lord!\u201d exclaimed the count. \u201cWhere is the manifesto?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Emperor\u2019s appeal? Oh yes!\u201d\n\nPierre began feeling in his pockets for the papers, but could not find them. Still slapping his pockets, he kissed the hand of the countess who entered the room and glanced uneasily around, evidently expecting Nat\u00e1sha, who had left off singing but had not yet come into the drawing room.\n\n\u201cOn my word, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019ve done with it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThere he is, always losing everything!\u201d remarked the countess.\n\nNat\u00e1sha entered with a softened and agitated expression of face and sat down looking silently at Pierre. As soon as she entered, Pierre\u2019s features, which had been gloomy, suddenly lighted up, and while still searching for the papers he glanced at her several times.\n\n\u201cNo, really! I\u2019ll drive home, I must have left them there. I\u2019ll certainly...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you\u2019ll be late for dinner.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh! And my coachman has gone.\u201d\n\nBut S\u00f3nya, who had gone to look for the papers in the anteroom, had found them in Pierre\u2019s hat, where he had carefully tucked them under the lining. Pierre was about to begin reading.\n\n\u201cNo, after dinner,\u201d said the old count, evidently expecting much enjoyment from that reading.\n\nAt dinner, at which champagne was drunk to the health of the new chevalier of St. George, Shinsh\u00edn told them the town news, of the illness of the old Georgian princess, of M\u00e9tivier\u2019s disappearance from Moscow, and of how some German fellow had been brought to Rostopch\u00edn and accused of being a French \u201cspyer\u201d (so Count Rostopch\u00edn had told the story), and how Rostopch\u00edn let him go and assured the people that he was \u201cnot a spire at all, but only an old German ruin.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople are being arrested...\u201d said the count. \u201cI\u2019ve told the countess she should not speak French so much. It\u2019s not the time for it now.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd have you heard?\u201d Shinsh\u00edn asked. \u201cPrince Gol\u00edtsyn has engaged a master to teach him Russian. It is becoming dangerous to speak French in the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how about you, Count Peter Kir\u00edlych? If they call up the militia, you too will have to mount a horse,\u201d remarked the old count, addressing Pierre.\n\nPierre had been silent and preoccupied all through dinner, seeming not to grasp what was said. He looked at the count.\n\n\u201cOh yes, the war,\u201d he said. \u201cNo! What sort of warrior should I make? And yet everything is so strange, so strange! I can\u2019t make it out. I don\u2019t know, I am very far from having military tastes, but in these times no one can answer for himself.\u201d\n\nAfter dinner the count settled himself comfortably in an easy chair and with a serious face asked S\u00f3nya, who was considered an excellent reader, to read the appeal.\n\n\u201cTo Moscow, our ancient Capital!\n\n\u201cThe enemy has entered the borders of Russia with immense forces. He comes to despoil our beloved country.\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya read painstakingly in her high-pitched voice. The count listened with closed eyes, heaving abrupt sighs at certain passages.\n\nNat\u00e1sha sat erect, gazing with a searching look now at her father and now at Pierre.\n\nPierre felt her eyes on him and tried not to look round. The countess shook her head disapprovingly and angrily at every solemn expression in the manifesto. In all these words she saw only that the danger threatening her son would not soon be over. Shinsh\u00edn, with a sarcastic smile on his lips, was evidently preparing to make fun of anything that gave him the opportunity: S\u00f3nya\u2019s reading, any remark of the count\u2019s, or even the manifesto itself should no better pretext present itself.\n\nAfter reading about the dangers that threatened Russia, the hopes the Emperor placed on Moscow and especially on its illustrious nobility, S\u00f3nya, with a quiver in her voice due chiefly to the attention that was being paid to her, read the last words:\n\n\u201cWe ourselves will not delay to appear among our people in that Capital and in other parts of our realm for consultation, and for the direction of all our levies, both those now barring the enemy\u2019s path and those freshly formed to defeat him wherever he may appear. May the ruin he hopes to bring upon us recoil on his own head, and may Europe delivered from bondage glorify the name of Russia!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it!\u201d cried the count, opening his moist eyes and sniffing repeatedly, as if a strong vinaigrette had been held to his nose; and he added, \u201cLet the Emperor but say the word and we\u2019ll sacrifice everything and begrudge nothing.\u201d\n\nBefore Shinsh\u00edn had time to utter the joke he was ready to make on the count\u2019s patriotism, Nat\u00e1sha jumped up from her place and ran to her father.\n\n\u201cWhat a darling our Papa is!\u201d she cried, kissing him, and she again looked at Pierre with the unconscious coquetry that had returned to her with her better spirits.\n\n\u201cThere! Here\u2019s a patriot for you!\u201d said Shinsh\u00edn.\n\n\u201cNot a patriot at all, but simply...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha replied in an injured tone. \u201cEverything seems funny to you, but this isn\u2019t at all a joke....\u201d\n\n\u201cA joke indeed!\u201d put in the count. \u201cLet him but say the word and we\u2019ll all go.... We\u2019re not Germans!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut did you notice, it says, \u2018for consultation\u2019?\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cNever mind what it\u2019s for....\u201d\n\nAt this moment, P\u00e9tya, to whom nobody was paying any attention, came up to his father with a very flushed face and said in his breaking voice that was now deep and now shrill:\n\n\u201cWell, Papa, I tell you definitely, and Mamma too, it\u2019s as you please, but I say definitely that you must let me enter the army, because I can\u2019t... that\u2019s all....\u201d\n\nThe countess, in dismay, looked up to heaven, clasped her hands, and turned angrily to her husband.\n\n\u201cThat comes of your talking!\u201d said she.\n\nBut the count had already recovered from his excitement.\n\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d said he. \u201cHere\u2019s a fine warrior! No! Nonsense! You must study.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not nonsense, Papa. F\u00e9dya Obol\u00e9nski is younger than I, and he\u2019s going too. Besides, all the same I can\u2019t study now when...\u201d P\u00e9tya stopped short, flushed till he perspired, but still got out the words, \u201cwhen our Fatherland is in danger.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll do, that\u2019ll do\u2014nonsense....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you said yourself that we would sacrifice everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cP\u00e9tya! Be quiet, I tell you!\u201d cried the count, with a glance at his wife, who had turned pale and was staring fixedly at her son.\n\n\u201cAnd I tell you\u2014Peter Kir\u00edlych here will also tell you...\u201d\n\n\u201cNonsense, I tell you. Your mother\u2019s milk has hardly dried on your lips and you want to go into the army! There, there, I tell you,\u201d and the count moved to go out of the room, taking the papers, probably to reread them in his study before having a nap.\n\n\u201cWell, Peter Kir\u00edlych, let\u2019s go and have a smoke,\u201d he said.\n\nPierre was agitated and undecided. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s unwontedly brilliant eyes, continually glancing at him with a more than cordial look, had reduced him to this condition.\n\n\u201cNo, I think I\u2019ll go home.\u201d\n\n\u201cHome? Why, you meant to spend the evening with us.... You don\u2019t often come nowadays as it is, and this girl of mine,\u201d said the count good-naturedly, pointing to Nat\u00e1sha, \u201conly brightens up when you\u2019re here.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I had forgotten... I really must go home... business...\u201d said Pierre hurriedly.\n\n\u201cWell, then, au revoir!\u201d said the count, and went out of the room.\n\n\u201cWhy are you going? Why are you upset?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, and she looked challengingly into Pierre\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cBecause I love you!\u201d was what he wanted to say, but he did not say it, and only blushed till the tears came, and lowered his eyes.\n\n\u201cBecause it is better for me to come less often... because... No, simply I have business....\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? No, tell me!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began resolutely and suddenly stopped.\n\nThey looked at each other with dismayed and embarrassed faces. He tried to smile but could not: his smile expressed suffering, and he silently kissed her hand and went out.\n\nPierre made up his mind not to go to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 any more.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nAfter the definite refusal he had received, P\u00e9tya went to his room and there locked himself in and wept bitterly. When he came in to tea, silent, morose, and with tear-stained face, everybody pretended not to notice anything.\n\nNext day the Emperor arrived in Moscow, and several of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 domestic serfs begged permission to go to have a look at him. That morning P\u00e9tya was a long time dressing and arranging his hair and collar to look like a grown-up man. He frowned before his looking glass, gesticulated, shrugged his shoulders, and finally, without saying a word to anyone, took his cap and left the house by the back door, trying to avoid notice. P\u00e9tya decided to go straight to where the Emperor was and to explain frankly to some gentleman-in-waiting (he imagined the Emperor to be always surrounded by gentlemen-in-waiting) that he, Count Rost\u00f3v, in spite of his youth wished to serve his country; that youth could be no hindrance to loyalty, and that he was ready to... While dressing, P\u00e9tya had prepared many fine things he meant to say to the gentleman-in-waiting.\n\nIt was on the very fact of being so young that P\u00e9tya counted for success in reaching the Emperor\u2014he even thought how surprised everyone would be at his youthfulness\u2014and yet in the arrangement of his collar and hair and by his sedate deliberate walk he wished to appear a grown-up man. But the farther he went and the more his attention was diverted by the ever-increasing crowds moving toward the Kr\u00e9mlin, the less he remembered to walk with the sedateness and deliberation of a man. As he approached the Kr\u00e9mlin he even began to avoid being crushed and resolutely stuck out his elbows in a menacing way. But within the Trinity Gateway he was so pressed to the wall by people who probably were unaware of the patriotic intentions with which he had come that in spite of all his determination he had to give in, and stop while carriages passed in, rumbling beneath the archway. Beside P\u00e9tya stood a peasant woman, a footman, two tradesmen, and a discharged soldier. After standing some time in the gateway, P\u00e9tya tried to move forward in front of the others without waiting for all the carriages to pass, and he began resolutely working his way with his elbows, but the woman just in front of him, who was the first against whom he directed his efforts, angrily shouted at him:\n\n\u201cWhat are you shoving for, young lordling? Don\u2019t you see we\u2019re all standing still? Then why push?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnybody can shove,\u201d said the footman, and also began working his elbows to such effect that he pushed P\u00e9tya into a very filthy corner of the gateway.\n\nP\u00e9tya wiped his perspiring face with his hands and pulled up the damp collar which he had arranged so well at home to seem like a man\u2019s.\n\nHe felt that he no longer looked presentable, and feared that if he were now to approach the gentlemen-in-waiting in that plight he would not be admitted to the Emperor. But it was impossible to smarten oneself up or move to another place, because of the crowd. One of the generals who drove past was an acquaintance of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, and P\u00e9tya thought of asking his help, but came to the conclusion that that would not be a manly thing to do. When the carriages had all passed in, the crowd, carrying P\u00e9tya with it, streamed forward into the Kr\u00e9mlin Square which was already full of people. There were people not only in the square, but everywhere\u2014on the slopes and on the roofs. As soon as P\u00e9tya found himself in the square he clearly heard the sound of bells and the joyous voices of the crowd that filled the whole Kr\u00e9mlin.\n\nFor a while the crowd was less dense, but suddenly all heads were bared, and everyone rushed forward in one direction. P\u00e9tya was being pressed so that he could scarcely breathe, and everybody shouted, \u201cHurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\u201d P\u00e9tya stood on tiptoe and pushed and pinched, but could see nothing except the people about him.\n\nAll the faces bore the same expression of excitement and enthusiasm. A tradesman\u2019s wife standing beside P\u00e9tya sobbed, and the tears ran down her cheeks.\n\n\u201cFather! Angel! Dear one!\u201d she kept repeating, wiping away her tears with her fingers.\n\n\u201cHurrah!\u201d was heard on all sides.\n\nFor a moment the crowd stood still, but then it made another rush forward.\n\nQuite beside himself, P\u00e9tya, clinching his teeth and rolling his eyes ferociously, pushed forward, elbowing his way and shouting \u201churrah!\u201d as if he were prepared that instant to kill himself and everyone else, but on both sides of him other people with similarly ferocious faces pushed forward and everybody shouted \u201churrah!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is what the Emperor is!\u201d thought P\u00e9tya. \u201cNo, I can\u2019t petition him myself\u2014that would be too bold.\u201d But in spite of this he continued to struggle desperately forward, and from between the backs of those in front he caught glimpses of an open space with a strip of red cloth spread out on it; but just then the crowd swayed back\u2014the police in front were pushing back those who had pressed too close to the procession: the Emperor was passing from the palace to the Cathedral of the Assumption\u2014and P\u00e9tya unexpectedly received such a blow on his side and ribs and was squeezed so hard that suddenly everything grew dim before his eyes and he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, a man of clerical appearance with a tuft of gray hair at the back of his head and wearing a shabby blue cassock\u2014probably a church clerk and chanter\u2014was holding him under the arm with one hand while warding off the pressure of the crowd with the other.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve crushed the young gentleman!\u201d said the clerk. \u201cWhat are you up to? Gently!... They\u2019ve crushed him, crushed him!\u201d\n\nThe Emperor entered the Cathedral of the Assumption. The crowd spread out again more evenly, and the clerk led P\u00e9tya\u2014pale and breathless\u2014to the Tsar-cannon. Several people were sorry for P\u00e9tya, and suddenly a crowd turned toward him and pressed round him. Those who stood nearest him attended to him, unbuttoned his coat, seated him on the raised platform of the cannon, and reproached those others (whoever they might be) who had crushed him.\n\n\u201cOne might easily get killed that way! What do they mean by it? Killing people! Poor dear, he\u2019s as white as a sheet!\u201d\u2014various voices were heard saying.\n\nP\u00e9tya soon came to himself, the color returned to his face, the pain had passed, and at the cost of that temporary unpleasantness he had obtained a place by the cannon from where he hoped to see the Emperor who would be returning that way. P\u00e9tya no longer thought of presenting his petition. If he could only see the Emperor he would be happy!\n\nWhile the service was proceeding in the Cathedral of the Assumption\u2014it was a combined service of prayer on the occasion of the Emperor\u2019s arrival and of thanksgiving for the conclusion of peace with the Turks\u2014the crowd outside spread out and hawkers appeared, selling kvass, gingerbread, and poppyseed sweets (of which P\u00e9tya was particularly fond), and ordinary conversation could again be heard. A tradesman\u2019s wife was showing a rent in her shawl and telling how much the shawl had cost; another was saying that all silk goods had now got dear. The clerk who had rescued P\u00e9tya was talking to a functionary about the priests who were officiating that day with the bishop. The clerk several times used the word \u201cplenary\u201d (of the service), a word P\u00e9tya did not understand. Two young citizens were joking with some serf girls who were cracking nuts. All these conversations, especially the joking with the girls, were such as might have had a particular charm for P\u00e9tya at his age, but they did not interest him now. He sat on his elevation\u2014the pedestal of the cannon\u2014still agitated as before by the thought of the Emperor and by his love for him. The feeling of pain and fear he had experienced when he was being crushed, together with that of rapture, still further intensified his sense of the importance of the occasion.\n\nSuddenly the sound of a firing of cannon was heard from the embankment, to celebrate the signing of peace with the Turks, and the crowd rushed impetuously toward the embankment to watch the firing. P\u00e9tya too would have run there, but the clerk who had taken the young gentleman under his protection stopped him. The firing was still proceeding when officers, generals, and gentlemen-in-waiting came running out of the cathedral, and after them others in a more leisurely manner: caps were again raised, and those who had run to look at the cannon ran back again. At last four men in uniforms and sashes emerged from the cathedral doors. \u201cHurrah! hurrah!\u201d shouted the crowd again.\n\n\u201cWhich is he? Which?\u201d asked P\u00e9tya in a tearful voice, of those around him, but no one answered him, everybody was too excited; and P\u00e9tya, fixing on one of those four men, whom he could not clearly see for the tears of joy that filled his eyes, concentrated all his enthusiasm on him\u2014though it happened not to be the Emperor\u2014frantically shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d and resolved that tomorrow, come what might, he would join the army.\n\nThe crowd ran after the Emperor, followed him to the palace, and began to disperse. It was already late, and P\u00e9tya had not eaten anything and was drenched with perspiration, yet he did not go home but stood with that diminishing, but still considerable, crowd before the palace while the Emperor dined\u2014looking in at the palace windows, expecting he knew not what, and envying alike the notables he saw arriving at the entrance to dine with the Emperor and the court footmen who served at table, glimpses of whom could be seen through the windows.\n\nWhile the Emperor was dining, Val\u00faev, looking out of the window, said:\n\n\u201cThe people are still hoping to see Your Majesty again.\u201d\n\nThe dinner was nearly over, and the Emperor, munching a biscuit, rose and went out onto the balcony. The people, with P\u00e9tya among them, rushed toward the balcony.\n\n\u201cAngel! Dear one! Hurrah! Father!...\u201d cried the crowd, and P\u00e9tya with it, and again the women and men of weaker mold, P\u00e9tya among them, wept with joy.\n\nA largish piece of the biscuit the Emperor was holding in his hand broke off, fell on the balcony parapet, and then to the ground. A coachman in a jerkin, who stood nearest, sprang forward and snatched it up. Several people in the crowd rushed at the coachman. Seeing this the Emperor had a plateful of biscuits brought him and began throwing them down from the balcony. P\u00e9tya\u2019s eyes grew bloodshot, and still more excited by the danger of being crushed, he rushed at the biscuits. He did not know why, but he had to have a biscuit from the Tsar\u2019s hand and he felt that he must not give way. He sprang forward and upset an old woman who was catching at a biscuit; the old woman did not consider herself defeated though she was lying on the ground\u2014she grabbed at some biscuits but her hand did not reach them. P\u00e9tya pushed her hand away with his knee, seized a biscuit, and as if fearing to be too late, again shouted \u201cHurrah!\u201d with a voice already hoarse.\n\nThe Emperor went in, and after that the greater part of the crowd began to disperse.\n\n\u201cThere! I said if only we waited\u2014and so it was!\u201d was being joyfully said by various people.\n\nHappy as P\u00e9tya was, he felt sad at having to go home knowing that all the enjoyment of that day was over. He did not go straight home from the Kr\u00e9mlin, but called on his friend Obol\u00e9nski, who was fifteen and was also entering the regiment. On returning home P\u00e9tya announced resolutely and firmly that if he was not allowed to enter the service he would run away. And next day, Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v\u2014though he had not yet quite yielded\u2014went to inquire how he could arrange for P\u00e9tya to serve where there would be least danger.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nTwo days later, on the fifteenth of July, an immense number of carriages were standing outside the Slob\u00f3da Palace.\n\nThe great halls were full. In the first were the nobility and gentry in their uniforms, in the second bearded merchants in full-skirted coats of blue cloth and wearing medals. In the noblemen\u2019s hall there was an incessant movement and buzz of voices. The chief magnates sat on high-backed chairs at a large table under the portrait of the Emperor, but most of the gentry were strolling about the room.\n\nAll these nobles, whom Pierre met every day at the Club or in their own houses, were in uniform\u2014some in that of Catherine\u2019s day, others in that of Emperor Paul, others again in the new uniforms of Alexander\u2019s time or the ordinary uniform of the nobility, and the general characteristic of being in uniform imparted something strange and fantastic to these diverse and familiar personalities, both old and young. The old men, dim-eyed, toothless, bald, sallow, and bloated, or gaunt and wrinkled, were especially striking. For the most part they sat quietly in their places and were silent, or, if they walked about and talked, attached themselves to someone younger. On all these faces, as on the faces of the crowd P\u00e9tya had seen in the Square, there was a striking contradiction: the general expectation of a solemn event, and at the same time the everyday interests in a boston card party, Peter the cook, Zina\u00edda Dm\u00edtrievna\u2019s health, and so on.\n\nPierre was there too, buttoned up since early morning in a nobleman\u2019s uniform that had become too tight for him. He was agitated; this extraordinary gathering not only of nobles but also of the merchant-class\u2014les \u00e9tats g\u00e9n\u00e9raux (States-General)\u2014evoked in him a whole series of ideas he had long laid aside but which were deeply graven in his soul: thoughts of the Contrat Social and the French Revolution. The words that had struck him in the Emperor\u2019s appeal\u2014that the sovereign was coming to the capital for consultation with his people\u2014strengthened this idea. And imagining that in this direction something important which he had long awaited was drawing near, he strolled about watching and listening to conversations, but nowhere finding any confirmation of the ideas that occupied him.\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s manifesto was read, evoking enthusiasm, and then all moved about discussing it. Besides the ordinary topics of conversation, Pierre heard questions of where the marshals of the nobility were to stand when the Emperor entered, when a ball should be given in the Emperor\u2019s honor, whether they should group themselves by districts or by whole provinces... and so on; but as soon as the war was touched on, or what the nobility had been convened for, the talk became undecided and indefinite. Then all preferred listening to speaking.\n\nA middle-aged man, handsome and virile, in the uniform of a retired naval officer, was speaking in one of the rooms, and a small crowd was pressing round him. Pierre went up to the circle that had formed round the speaker and listened. Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, in a military uniform of Catherine\u2019s time, was sauntering with a pleasant smile among the crowd, with all of whom he was acquainted. He too approached that group and listened with a kindly smile and nods of approval, as he always did, to what the speaker was saying. The retired naval man was speaking very boldly, as was evident from the expression on the faces of the listeners and from the fact that some people Pierre knew as the meekest and quietest of men walked away disapprovingly or expressed disagreement with him. Pierre pushed his way into the middle of the group, listened, and convinced himself that the man was indeed a liberal, but of views quite different from his own. The naval officer spoke in a particularly sonorous, musical, and aristocratic baritone voice, pleasantly swallowing his r\u2019s and generally slurring his consonants: the voice of a man calling out to his servant, \u201cHeah! Bwing me my pipe!\u201d It was indicative of dissipation and the exercise of authority.\n\n\u201cWhat if the Smol\u00e9nsk people have offahd to waise militia for the Empewah? Ah we to take Smol\u00e9nsk as our patte\u2019n? If the noble awistocwacy of the pwovince of Moscow thinks fit, it can show its loyalty to our sov\u2019weign the Empewah in other ways. Have we fo\u2019gotten the waising of the militia in the yeah \u2018seven? All that did was to enwich the pwiests\u2019 sons and thieves and wobbahs....\u201d\n\nCount Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v smiled blandly and nodded approval.\n\n\u201cAnd was our militia of any use to the Empia? Not at all! It only wuined our farming! Bettah have another conscwiption... o\u2019 ou\u2019 men will wetu\u2019n neithah soldiers no\u2019 peasants, and we\u2019ll get only depwavity fwom them. The nobility don\u2019t gwudge theah lives\u2014evewy one of us will go and bwing in more wecwuits, and the sov\u2019weign\u201d (that was the way he referred to the Emperor) \u201cneed only say the word and we\u2019ll all die fo\u2019 him!\u201d added the orator with animation.\n\nCount Rost\u00f3v\u2019s mouth watered with pleasure and he nudged Pierre, but Pierre wanted to speak himself. He pushed forward, feeling stirred, but not yet sure what stirred him or what he would say. Scarcely had he opened his mouth when one of the senators, a man without a tooth in his head, with a shrewd though angry expression, standing near the first speaker, interrupted him. Evidently accustomed to managing debates and to maintaining an argument, he began in low but distinct tones:\n\n\u201cI imagine, sir,\u201d said he, mumbling with his toothless mouth, \u201cthat we have been summoned here not to discuss whether it\u2019s best for the empire at the present moment to adopt conscription or to call out the militia. We have been summoned to reply to the appeal with which our sovereign the Emperor has honored us. But to judge what is best\u2014conscription or the militia\u2014we can leave to the supreme authority....\u201d\n\nPierre suddenly saw an outlet for his excitement. He hardened his heart against the senator who was introducing this set and narrow attitude into the deliberations of the nobility. Pierre stepped forward and interrupted him. He himself did not yet know what he would say, but he began to speak eagerly, occasionally lapsing into French or expressing himself in bookish Russian.\n\n\u201cExcuse me, your excellency,\u201d he began. (He was well acquainted with the senator, but thought it necessary on this occasion to address him formally.) \u201cThough I don\u2019t agree with the gentleman...\u201d (he hesitated: he wished to say, \u201cMon tr\u00e8s honorable pr\u00e9opinant\u201d\u2014\u201cMy very honorable opponent\u201d) \u201cwith the gentleman... whom I have not the honor of knowing, I suppose that the nobility have been summoned not merely to express their sympathy and enthusiasm but also to consider the means by which we can assist our Fatherland! I imagine,\u201d he went on, warming to his subject, \u201cthat the Emperor himself would not be satisfied to find in us merely owners of serfs whom we are willing to devote to his service, and chair \u00e0 canon we are ready to make of ourselves\u2014and not to obtain from us any co-co-counsel.\u201d\n\nMany persons withdrew from the circle, noticing the senator\u2019s sarcastic smile and the freedom of Pierre\u2019s remarks. Only Count Rost\u00f3v was pleased with them as he had been pleased with those of the naval officer, the senator, and in general with whatever speech he had last heard.\n\n\u201cI think that before discussing these questions,\u201d Pierre continued, \u201cwe should ask the Emperor\u2014most respectfully ask His Majesty\u2014to let us know the number of our troops and the position in which our army and our forces now are, and then...\u201d\n\nBut scarcely had Pierre uttered these words before he was attacked from three sides. The most vigorous attack came from an old acquaintance, a boston player who had always been well disposed toward him, Step\u00e1n Step\u00e1novich Adr\u00e1ksin. Adr\u00e1ksin was in uniform, and whether as a result of the uniform or from some other cause Pierre saw before him quite a different man. With a sudden expression of malevolence on his aged face, Adr\u00e1ksin shouted at Pierre:\n\n\u201cIn the first place, I tell you we have no right to question the Emperor about that, and secondly, if the Russian nobility had that right, the Emperor could not answer such a question. The troops are moved according to the enemy\u2019s movements and the number of men increases and decreases....\u201d\n\nAnother voice, that of a nobleman of medium height and about forty years of age, whom Pierre had formerly met at the gypsies\u2019 and knew as a bad cardplayer, and who, also transformed by his uniform, came up to Pierre, interrupted Adr\u00e1ksin.\n\n\u201cYes, and this is not a time for discussing,\u201d he continued, \u201cbut for acting: there is war in Russia! The enemy is advancing to destroy Russia, to desecrate the tombs of our fathers, to carry off our wives and children.\u201d The nobleman smote his breast. \u201cWe will all arise, everyone of us will go, for our father the Tsar!\u201d he shouted, rolling his bloodshot eyes. Several approving voices were heard in the crowd. \u201cWe are Russians and will not grudge our blood in defense of our faith, the throne, and the Fatherland! We must cease raving if we are sons of our Fatherland! We will show Europe how Russia rises to the defense of Russia!\u201d\n\nPierre wished to reply, but could not get in a word. He felt that his words, apart from what meaning they conveyed, were less audible than the sound of his opponent\u2019s voice.\n\nCount Rost\u00f3v at the back of the crowd was expressing approval; several persons, briskly turning a shoulder to the orator at the end of a phrase, said:\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, quite right! Just so!\u201d\n\nPierre wished to say that he was ready to sacrifice his money, his serfs, or himself, only one ought to know the state of affairs in order to be able to improve it, but he was unable to speak. Many voices shouted and talked at the same time, so that Count Rost\u00f3v had not time to signify his approval of them all, and the group increased, dispersed, re-formed, and then moved with a hum of talk into the largest hall and to the big table. Not only was Pierre\u2019s attempt to speak unsuccessful, but he was rudely interrupted, pushed aside, and people turned away from him as from a common enemy. This happened not because they were displeased by the substance of his speech, which had even been forgotten after the many subsequent speeches, but to animate it the crowd needed a tangible object to love and a tangible object to hate. Pierre became the latter. Many other orators spoke after the excited nobleman, and all in the same tone. Many spoke eloquently and with originality.\n\nGl\u00ednka, the editor of the Russian Messenger, who was recognized (cries of \u201cauthor! author!\u201d were heard in the crowd), said that \u201chell must be repulsed by hell,\u201d and that he had seen a child smiling at lightning flashes and thunderclaps, but \u201cwe will not be that child.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, at thunderclaps!\u201d was repeated approvingly in the back rows of the crowd.\n\nThe crowd drew up to the large table, at which sat gray-haired or bald seventy-year-old magnates, uniformed and besashed, almost all of whom Pierre had seen in their own homes with their buffoons, or playing boston at the clubs. With an incessant hum of voices the crowd advanced to the table. Pressed by the throng against the high backs of the chairs, the orators spoke one after another and sometimes two together. Those standing behind noticed what a speaker omitted to say and hastened to supply it. Others in that heat and crush racked their brains to find some thought and hastened to utter it. The old magnates, whom Pierre knew, sat and turned to look first at one and then at another, and their faces for the most part only expressed the fact that they found it very hot. Pierre, however, felt excited, and the general desire to show that they were ready to go to all lengths\u2014which found expression in the tones and looks more than in the substance of the speeches\u2014infected him too. He did not renounce his opinions, but felt himself in some way to blame and wished to justify himself.\n\n\u201cI only said that it would be more to the purpose to make sacrifices when we know what is needed!\u201d said he, trying to be heard above the other voices.\n\nOne of the old men nearest to him looked round, but his attention was immediately diverted by an exclamation at the other side of the table.\n\n\u201cYes, Moscow will be surrendered! She will be our expiation!\u201d shouted one man.\n\n\u201cHe is the enemy of mankind!\u201d cried another. \u201cAllow me to speak....\u201d \u201cGentlemen, you are crushing me!...\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nAt that moment Count Rostopch\u00edn with his protruding chin and alert eyes, wearing the uniform of a general with sash over his shoulder, entered the room, stepping briskly to the front of the crowd of gentry.\n\n\u201cOur sovereign the Emperor will be here in a moment,\u201d said Rostopch\u00edn. \u201cI am straight from the palace. Seeing the position we are in, I think there is little need for discussion. The Emperor has deigned to summon us and the merchants. Millions will pour forth from there\u201d\u2014he pointed to the merchants\u2019 hall\u2014\u201cbut our business is to supply men and not spare ourselves.... That is the least we can do!\u201d\n\nA conference took place confined to the magnates sitting at the table. The whole consultation passed more than quietly. After all the preceding noise the sound of their old voices saying one after another, \u201cI agree,\u201d or for variety, \u201cI too am of that opinion,\u201d and so on had even a mournful effect.\n\nThe secretary was told to write down the resolution of the Moscow nobility and gentry, that they would furnish ten men, fully equipped, out of every thousand serfs, as the Smol\u00e9nsk gentry had done. Their chairs made a scraping noise as the gentlemen who had conferred rose with apparent relief, and began walking up and down, arm in arm, to stretch their legs and converse in couples.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor! The Emperor!\u201d a sudden cry resounded through the halls and the whole throng hurried to the entrance.\n\nThe Emperor entered the hall through a broad path between two lines of nobles. Every face expressed respectful, awe-struck curiosity. Pierre stood rather far off and could not hear all that the Emperor said. From what he did hear he understood that the Emperor spoke of the danger threatening the empire and of the hopes he placed on the Moscow nobility. He was answered by a voice which informed him of the resolution just arrived at.\n\n\u201cGentlemen!\u201d said the Emperor with a quivering voice.\n\nThere was a rustling among the crowd and it again subsided, so that Pierre distinctly heard the pleasantly human voice of the Emperor saying with emotion:\n\n\u201cI never doubted the devotion of the Russian nobles, but today it has surpassed my expectations. I thank you in the name of the Fatherland! Gentlemen, let us act! Time is most precious....\u201d\n\nThe Emperor ceased speaking, the crowd began pressing round him, and rapturous exclamations were heard from all sides.\n\n\u201cYes, most precious... a royal word,\u201d said Count Rost\u00f3v, with a sob. He stood at the back, and, though he had heard hardly anything, understood everything in his own way.\n\nFrom the hall of the nobility the Emperor went to that of the merchants. There he remained about ten minutes. Pierre was among those who saw him come out from the merchants\u2019 hall with tears of emotion in his eyes. As became known later, he had scarcely begun to address the merchants before tears gushed from his eyes and he concluded in a trembling voice. When Pierre saw the Emperor he was coming out accompanied by two merchants, one of whom Pierre knew, a fat otkupshch\u00edk. The other was the mayor, a man with a thin sallow face and narrow beard. Both were weeping. Tears filled the thin man\u2019s eyes, and the fat otkupshch\u00edk sobbed outright like a child and kept repeating:\n\n\u201cOur lives and property\u2014take them, Your Majesty!\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s one feeling at the moment was a desire to show that he was ready to go all lengths and was prepared to sacrifice everything. He now felt ashamed of his speech with its constitutional tendency and sought an opportunity of effacing it. Having heard that Count Mam\u00f3nov was furnishing a regiment, Bez\u00fakhov at once informed Rostopch\u00edn that he would give a thousand men and their maintenance.\n\nOld Rost\u00f3v could not tell his wife of what had passed without tears, and at once consented to P\u00e9tya\u2019s request and went himself to enter his name.\n\nNext day the Emperor left Moscow. The assembled nobles all took off their uniforms and settled down again in their homes and clubs, and not without some groans gave orders to their stewards about the enrollment, feeling amazed themselves at what they had done.\n\n\n\nBOOK TEN: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nNapoleon began the war with Russia because he could not resist going to Dresden, could not help having his head turned by the homage he received, could not help donning a Polish uniform and yielding to the stimulating influence of a June morning, and could not refrain from bursts of anger in the presence of Kur\u00e1kin and then of Balash\u00ebv.\n\nAlexander refused negotiations because he felt himself to be personally insulted. Barclay de Tolly tried to command the army in the best way, because he wished to fulfill his duty and earn fame as a great commander. Rost\u00f3v charged the French because he could not restrain his wish for a gallop across a level field; and in the same way the innumerable people who took part in the war acted in accord with their personal characteristics, habits, circumstances, and aims. They were moved by fear or vanity, rejoiced or were indignant, reasoned, imagining that they knew what they were doing and did it of their own free will, but they all were involuntary tools of history, carrying on a work concealed from them but comprehensible to us. Such is the inevitable fate of men of action, and the higher they stand in the social hierarchy the less are they free.\n\nThe actors of 1812 have long since left the stage, their personal interests have vanished leaving no trace, and nothing remains of that time but its historic results.\n\nProvidence compelled all these men, striving to attain personal aims, to further the accomplishment of a stupendous result no one of them at all expected\u2014neither Napoleon, nor Alexander, nor still less any of those who did the actual fighting.\n\nThe cause of the destruction of the French army in 1812 is clear to us now. No one will deny that that cause was, on the one hand, its advance into the heart of Russia late in the season without any preparation for a winter campaign and, on the other, the character given to the war by the burning of Russian towns and the hatred of the foe this aroused among the Russian people. But no one at the time foresaw (what now seems so evident) that this was the only way an army of eight hundred thousand men\u2014the best in the world and led by the best general\u2014could be destroyed in conflict with a raw army of half its numerical strength, and led by inexperienced commanders as the Russian army was. Not only did no one see this, but on the Russian side every effort was made to hinder the only thing that could save Russia, while on the French side, despite Napoleon\u2019s experience and so-called military genius, every effort was directed to pushing on to Moscow at the end of the summer, that is, to doing the very thing that was bound to lead to destruction.\n\nIn historical works on the year 1812 French writers are very fond of saying that Napoleon felt the danger of extending his line, that he sought a battle and that his marshals advised him to stop at Smol\u00e9nsk, and of making similar statements to show that the danger of the campaign was even then understood. Russian authors are still fonder of telling us that from the commencement of the campaign a Scythian war plan was adopted to lure Napoleon into the depths of Russia, and this plan some of them attribute to Pfuel, others to a certain Frenchman, others to Toll, and others again to Alexander himself\u2014pointing to notes, projects, and letters which contain hints of such a line of action. But all these hints at what happened, both from the French side and the Russian, are advanced only because they fit in with the event. Had that event not occurred these hints would have been forgotten, as we have forgotten the thousands and millions of hints and expectations to the contrary which were current then but have now been forgotten because the event falsified them. There are always so many conjectures as to the issue of any event that however it may end there will always be people to say: \u201cI said then that it would be so,\u201d quite forgetting that amid their innumerable conjectures many were to quite the contrary effect.\n\nConjectures as to Napoleon\u2019s awareness of the danger of extending his line, and (on the Russian side) as to luring the enemy into the depths of Russia, are evidently of that kind, and only by much straining can historians attribute such conceptions to Napoleon and his marshals, or such plans to the Russian commanders. All the facts are in flat contradiction to such conjectures. During the whole period of the war not only was there no wish on the Russian side to draw the French into the heart of the country, but from their first entry into Russia everything was done to stop them. And not only was Napoleon not afraid to extend his line, but he welcomed every step forward as a triumph and did not seek battle as eagerly as in former campaigns, but very lazily.\n\nAt the very beginning of the war our armies were divided, and our sole aim was to unite them, though uniting the armies was no advantage if we meant to retire and lure the enemy into the depths of the country. Our Emperor joined the army to encourage it to defend every inch of Russian soil and not to retreat. The enormous Drissa camp was formed on Pfuel\u2019s plan, and there was no intention of retiring farther. The Emperor reproached the commanders in chief for every step they retired. He could not bear the idea of letting the enemy even reach Smol\u00e9nsk, still less could he contemplate the burning of Moscow, and when our armies did unite he was displeased that Smol\u00e9nsk was abandoned and burned without a general engagement having been fought under its walls.\n\nSo thought the Emperor, and the Russian commanders and people were still more provoked at the thought that our forces were retreating into the depths of the country.\n\nNapoleon having cut our armies apart advanced far into the country and missed several chances of forcing an engagement. In August he was at Smol\u00e9nsk and thought only of how to advance farther, though as we now see that advance was evidently ruinous to him.\n\nThe facts clearly show that Napoleon did not foresee the danger of the advance on Moscow, nor did Alexander and the Russian commanders then think of luring Napoleon on, but quite the contrary. The luring of Napoleon into the depths of the country was not the result of any plan, for no one believed it to be possible; it resulted from a most complex interplay of intrigues, aims, and wishes among those who took part in the war and had no perception whatever of the inevitable, or of the one way of saving Russia. Everything came about fortuitously. The armies were divided at the commencement of the campaign. We tried to unite them, with the evident intention of giving battle and checking the enemy\u2019s advance, and by this effort to unite them while avoiding battle with a much stronger enemy, and necessarily withdrawing the armies at an acute angle\u2014we led the French on to Smol\u00e9nsk. But we withdrew at an acute angle not only because the French advanced between our two armies; the angle became still more acute and we withdrew still farther, because Barclay de Tolly was an unpopular foreigner disliked by Bagrati\u00f3n (who would come under his command), and Bagrati\u00f3n\u2014being in command of the second army\u2014tried to postpone joining up and coming under Barclay\u2019s command as long as he could. Bagrati\u00f3n was slow in effecting the junction\u2014though that was the chief aim of all at headquarters\u2014because, as he alleged, he exposed his army to danger on this march, and it was best for him to retire more to the left and more to the south, worrying the enemy from flank and rear and securing from the Ukraine recruits for his army; and it looks as if he planned this in order not to come under the command of the detested foreigner Barclay, whose rank was inferior to his own.\n\nThe Emperor was with the army to encourage it, but his presence and ignorance of what steps to take, and the enormous number of advisers and plans, destroyed the first army\u2019s energy and it retired.\n\nThe intention was to make a stand at the Drissa camp, but Paulucci, aiming at becoming commander in chief, unexpectedly employed his energy to influence Alexander, and Pfuel\u2019s whole plan was abandoned and the command entrusted to Barclay. But as Barclay did not inspire confidence his power was limited. The armies were divided, there was no unity of command, and Barclay was unpopular; but from this confusion, division, and the unpopularity of the foreign commander in chief, there resulted on the one hand indecision and the avoidance of a battle (which we could not have refrained from had the armies been united and had someone else, instead of Barclay, been in command) and on the other an ever-increasing indignation against the foreigners and an increase in patriotic zeal.\n\nAt last the Emperor left the army, and as the most convenient and indeed the only pretext for his departure it was decided that it was necessary for him to inspire the people in the capitals and arouse the nation in general to a patriotic war. And by this visit of the Emperor to Moscow the strength of the Russian army was trebled.\n\nHe left in order not to obstruct the commander in chief\u2019s undivided control of the army, and hoping that more decisive action would then be taken, but the command of the armies became still more confused and enfeebled. Bennigsen, the Tsar\u00e9vich, and a swarm of adjutants general remained with the army to keep the commander in chief under observation and arouse his energy, and Barclay, feeling less free than ever under the observation of all these \u201ceyes of the Emperor,\u201d became still more cautious of undertaking any decisive action and avoided giving battle.\n\nBarclay stood for caution. The Tsar\u00e9vich hinted at treachery and demanded a general engagement. Lubom\u00edrski, Bronn\u00edtski, Wlocki, and the others of that group stirred up so much trouble that Barclay, under pretext of sending papers to the Emperor, dispatched these Polish adjutants general to Petersburg and plunged into an open struggle with Bennigsen and the Tsar\u00e9vich.\n\nAt Smol\u00e9nsk the armies at last reunited, much as Bagrati\u00f3n disliked it.\n\nBagrati\u00f3n drove up in a carriage to the house occupied by Barclay. Barclay donned his sash and came out to meet and report to his senior officer Bagrati\u00f3n.\n\nDespite his seniority in rank Bagrati\u00f3n, in this contest of magnanimity, took his orders from Barclay, but, having submitted, agreed with him less than ever. By the Emperor\u2019s orders Bagrati\u00f3n reported direct to him. He wrote to Arakch\u00e9ev, the Emperor\u2019s confidant: \u201cIt must be as my sovereign pleases, but I cannot work with the Minister (meaning Barclay). For God\u2019s sake send me somewhere else if only in command of a regiment. I cannot stand it here. Headquarters are so full of Germans that a Russian cannot exist and there is no sense in anything. I thought I was really serving my sovereign and the Fatherland, but it turns out that I am serving Barclay. I confess I do not want to.\u201d\n\nThe swarm of Bronn\u00edtskis and Wintzingerodes and their like still further embittered the relations between the commanders in chief, and even less unity resulted. Preparations were made to fight the French before Smol\u00e9nsk. A general was sent to survey the position. This general, hating Barclay, rode to visit a friend of his own, a corps commander, and, having spent the day with him, returned to Barclay and condemned, as unsuitable from every point of view, the battleground he had not seen.\n\nWhile disputes and intrigues were going on about the future field of battle, and while we were looking for the French\u2014having lost touch with them\u2014the French stumbled upon Nev\u00e9rovski\u2019s division and reached the walls of Smol\u00e9nsk.\n\nIt was necessary to fight an unexpected battle at Smol\u00e9nsk to save our lines of communication. The battle was fought and thousands were killed on both sides.\n\nSmol\u00e9nsk was abandoned contrary to the wishes of the Emperor and of the whole people. But Smol\u00e9nsk was burned by its own inhabitants who had been misled by their governor. And these ruined inhabitants, setting an example to other Russians, went to Moscow thinking only of their own losses but kindling hatred of the foe. Napoleon advanced farther and we retired, thus arriving at the very result which caused his destruction.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe day after his son had left, Prince Nicholas sent for Princess Mary to come to his study.\n\n\u201cWell? Are you satisfied now?\u201d said he. \u201cYou\u2019ve made me quarrel with my son! Satisfied, are you? That\u2019s all you wanted! Satisfied?... It hurts me, it hurts. I\u2019m old and weak and this is what you wanted. Well then, gloat over it! Gloat over it!\u201d\n\nAfter that Princess Mary did not see her father for a whole week. He was ill and did not leave his study.\n\nPrincess Mary noticed to her surprise that during this illness the old prince not only excluded her from his room, but did not admit Mademoiselle Bourienne either. T\u00edkhon alone attended him.\n\nAt the end of the week the prince reappeared and resumed his former way of life, devoting himself with special activity to building operations and the arrangement of the gardens and completely breaking off his relations with Mademoiselle Bourienne. His looks and cold tone to his daughter seemed to say: \u201cThere, you see? You plotted against me, you lied to Prince Andrew about my relations with that Frenchwoman and made me quarrel with him, but you see I need neither her nor you!\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary spent half of every day with little Nicholas, watching his lessons, teaching him Russian and music herself, and talking to Dessalles; the rest of the day she spent over her books, with her old nurse, or with \u201cGod\u2019s folk\u201d who sometimes came by the back door to see her.\n\nOf the war Princess Mary thought as women do think about wars. She feared for her brother who was in it, was horrified by and amazed at the strange cruelty that impels men to kill one another, but she did not understand the significance of this war, which seemed to her like all previous wars. She did not realize the significance of this war, though Dessalles with whom she constantly conversed was passionately interested in its progress and tried to explain his own conception of it to her, and though the \u201cGod\u2019s folk\u201d who came to see her reported, in their own way, the rumors current among the people of an invasion by Antichrist, and though Julie (now Princess Drubetsk\u00e1ya), who had resumed correspondence with her, wrote patriotic letters from Moscow.\n\n\u201cI write you in Russian, my good friend,\u201d wrote Julie in her Frenchified Russian, \u201cbecause I have a detestation for all the French, and the same for their language which I cannot support to hear spoken.... We in Moscow are elated by enthusiasm for our adored Emperor.\n\n\u201cMy poor husband is enduring pains and hunger in Jewish taverns, but the news which I have inspires me yet more.\n\n\u201cYou heard probably of the heroic exploit of Ra\u00e9vski, embracing his two sons and saying: \u2018I will perish with them but we will not be shaken!\u2019 And truly though the enemy was twice stronger than we, we were unshakable. We pass the time as we can, but in war as in war! The princesses Aline and Sophie sit whole days with me, and we, unhappy widows of live men, make beautiful conversations over our charpie, only you, my friend, are missing...\u201d and so on.\n\nThe chief reason Princess Mary did not realize the full significance of this war was that the old prince never spoke of it, did not recognize it, and laughed at Dessalles when he mentioned it at dinner. The prince\u2019s tone was so calm and confident that Princess Mary unhesitatingly believed him.\n\nAll that July the old prince was exceedingly active and even animated. He planned another garden and began a new building for the domestic serfs. The only thing that made Princess Mary anxious about him was that he slept very little and, instead of sleeping in his study as usual, changed his sleeping place every day. One day he would order his camp bed to be set up in the glass gallery, another day he remained on the couch or on the lounge chair in the drawing room and dozed there without undressing, while\u2014instead of Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2014a serf boy read to him. Then again he would spend a night in the dining room.\n\nOn August 1, a second letter was received from Prince Andrew. In his first letter which came soon after he had left home, Prince Andrew had dutifully asked his father\u2019s forgiveness for what he had allowed himself to say and begged to be restored to his favor. To this letter the old prince had replied affectionately, and from that time had kept the Frenchwoman at a distance. Prince Andrew\u2019s second letter, written ne", "sequence": 17}, {"offset": 1800000, "text": "ar V\u00edtebsk after the French had occupied that town, gave a brief account of the whole campaign, enclosed for them a plan he had drawn and forecasts as to the further progress of the war. In this letter Prince Andrew pointed out to his father the danger of staying at Bald Hills, so near the theater of war and on the army\u2019s direct line of march, and advised him to move to Moscow.\n\nAt dinner that day, on Dessalles\u2019 mentioning that the French were said to have already entered V\u00edtebsk, the old prince remembered his son\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cThere was a letter from Prince Andrew today,\u201d he said to Princess Mary\u2014\u201cHaven\u2019t you read it?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Father,\u201d she replied in a frightened voice.\n\nShe could not have read the letter as she did not even know it had arrived.\n\n\u201cHe writes about this war,\u201d said the prince, with the ironic smile that had become habitual to him in speaking of the present war.\n\n\u201cThat must be very interesting,\u201d said Dessalles. \u201cPrince Andrew is in a position to know...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, very interesting!\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\n\u201cGo and get it for me,\u201d said the old prince to Mademoiselle Bourienne. \u201cYou know\u2014under the paperweight on the little table.\u201d\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne jumped up eagerly.\n\n\u201cNo, don\u2019t!\u201d he exclaimed with a frown. \u201cYou go, Michael Iv\u00e1novich.\u201d\n\nMichael Iv\u00e1novich rose and went to the study. But as soon as he had left the room the old prince, looking uneasily round, threw down his napkin and went himself.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t do anything... always make some muddle,\u201d he muttered.\n\nWhile he was away Princess Mary, Dessalles, Mademoiselle Bourienne, and even little Nicholas exchanged looks in silence. The old prince returned with quick steps, accompanied by Michael Iv\u00e1novich, bringing the letter and a plan. These he put down beside him\u2014not letting anyone read them at dinner.\n\nOn moving to the drawing room he handed the letter to Princess Mary and, spreading out before him the plan of the new building and fixing his eyes upon it, told her to read the letter aloud. When she had done so Princess Mary looked inquiringly at her father. He was examining the plan, evidently engrossed in his own ideas.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of it, Prince?\u201d Dessalles ventured to ask.\n\n\u201cI? I?...\u201d said the prince as if unpleasantly awakened, and not taking his eyes from the plan of the building.\n\n\u201cVery possibly the theater of war will move so near to us that...\u201d\n\n\u201cHa ha ha! The theater of war!\u201d said the prince. \u201cI have said and still say that the theater of war is Poland and the enemy will never get beyond the Niemen.\u201d\n\nDessalles looked in amazement at the prince, who was talking of the Niemen when the enemy was already at the Dnieper, but Princess Mary, forgetting the geographical position of the Niemen, thought that what her father was saying was correct.\n\n\u201cWhen the snow melts they\u2019ll sink in the Polish swamps. Only they could fail to see it,\u201d the prince continued, evidently thinking of the campaign of 1807 which seemed to him so recent. \u201cBennigsen should have advanced into Prussia sooner, then things would have taken a different turn...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, Prince,\u201d Dessalles began timidly, \u201cthe letter mentions V\u00edtebsk....\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, the letter? Yes...\u201d replied the prince peevishly. \u201cYes... yes...\u201d His face suddenly took on a morose expression. He paused. \u201cYes, he writes that the French were beaten at... at... what river is it?\u201d\n\nDessalles dropped his eyes.\n\n\u201cThe prince says nothing about that,\u201d he remarked gently.\n\n\u201cDoesn\u2019t he? But I didn\u2019t invent it myself.\u201d\n\nNo one spoke for a long time.\n\n\u201cYes... yes... Well, Michael Iv\u00e1novich,\u201d he suddenly went on, raising his head and pointing to the plan of the building, \u201ctell me how you mean to alter it....\u201d\n\nMichael Iv\u00e1novich went up to the plan, and the prince after speaking to him about the building looked angrily at Princess Mary and Dessalles and went to his own room.\n\nPrincess Mary saw Dessalles\u2019 embarrassed and astonished look fixed on her father, noticed his silence, and was struck by the fact that her father had forgotten his son\u2019s letter on the drawing room table; but she was not only afraid to speak of it and ask Dessalles the reason of his confusion and silence, but was afraid even to think about it.\n\nIn the evening Michael Iv\u00e1novich, sent by the prince, came to Princess Mary for Prince Andrew\u2019s letter which had been forgotten in the drawing room. She gave it to him and, unpleasant as it was to her to do so, ventured to ask him what her father was doing.\n\n\u201cAlways busy,\u201d replied Michael Iv\u00e1novich with a respectfully ironic smile which caused Princess Mary to turn pale. \u201cHe\u2019s worrying very much about the new building. He has been reading a little, but now\u201d\u2014Michael Iv\u00e1novich went on, lowering his voice\u2014\u201cnow he\u2019s at his desk, busy with his will, I expect.\u201d (One of the prince\u2019s favorite occupations of late had been the preparation of some papers he meant to leave at his death and which he called his \u201cwill.\u201d)\n\n\u201cAnd Alp\u00e1tych is being sent to Smol\u00e9nsk?\u201d asked Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, he has been waiting to start for some time.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhen Michael Iv\u00e1novich returned to the study with the letter, the old prince, with spectacles on and a shade over his eyes, was sitting at his open bureau with screened candles, holding a paper in his outstretched hand, and in a somewhat dramatic attitude was reading his manuscript\u2014his \u201cRemarks\u201d as he termed it\u2014which was to be transmitted to the Emperor after his death.\n\nWhen Michael Iv\u00e1novich went in there were tears in the prince\u2019s eyes evoked by the memory of the time when the paper he was now reading had been written. He took the letter from Michael Iv\u00e1novich\u2019s hand, put it in his pocket, folded up his papers, and called in Alp\u00e1tych who had long been waiting.\n\nThe prince had a list of things to be bought in Smol\u00e9nsk and, walking up and down the room past Alp\u00e1tych who stood by the door, he gave his instructions.\n\n\u201cFirst, notepaper\u2014do you hear? Eight quires, like this sample, gilt-edged... it must be exactly like the sample. Varnish, sealing wax, as in Michael Iv\u00e1novich\u2019s list.\u201d\n\nHe paced up and down for a while and glanced at his notes.\n\n\u201cThen hand to the governor in person a letter about the deed.\u201d\n\nNext, bolts for the doors of the new building were wanted and had to be of a special shape the prince had himself designed, and a leather case had to be ordered to keep the \u201cwill\u201d in.\n\nThe instructions to Alp\u00e1tych took over two hours and still the prince did not let him go. He sat down, sank into thought, closed his eyes, and dozed off. Alp\u00e1tych made a slight movement.\n\n\u201cWell, go, go! If anything more is wanted I\u2019ll send after you.\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych went out. The prince again went to his bureau, glanced into it, fingered his papers, closed the bureau again, and sat down at the table to write to the governor.\n\nIt was already late when he rose after sealing the letter. He wished to sleep, but he knew he would not be able to and that most depressing thoughts came to him in bed. So he called T\u00edkhon and went through the rooms with him to show him where to set up the bed for that night.\n\nHe went about looking at every corner. Every place seemed unsatisfactory, but worst of all was his customary couch in the study. That couch was dreadful to him, probably because of the oppressive thoughts he had had when lying there. It was unsatisfactory everywhere, but the corner behind the piano in the sitting room was better than other places: he had never slept there yet.\n\nWith the help of a footman T\u00edkhon brought in the bedstead and began putting it up.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not right! That\u2019s not right!\u201d cried the prince, and himself pushed it a few inches from the corner and then closer in again.\n\n\u201cWell, at last I\u2019ve finished, now I\u2019ll rest,\u201d thought the prince, and let T\u00edkhon undress him.\n\nFrowning with vexation at the effort necessary to divest himself of his coat and trousers, the prince undressed, sat down heavily on the bed, and appeared to be meditating as he looked contemptuously at his withered yellow legs. He was not meditating, but only deferring the moment of making the effort to lift those legs up and turn over on the bed. \u201cUgh, how hard it is! Oh, that this toil might end and you would release me!\u201d thought he. Pressing his lips together he made that effort for the twenty-thousandth time and lay down. But hardly had he done so before he felt the bed rocking backwards and forwards beneath him as if it were breathing heavily and jolting. This happened to him almost every night. He opened his eyes as they were closing.\n\n\u201cNo peace, damn them!\u201d he muttered, angry he knew not with whom. \u201cAh yes, there was something else important, very important, that I was keeping till I should be in bed. The bolts? No, I told him about them. No, it was something, something in the drawing room. Princess Mary talked some nonsense. Dessalles, that fool, said something. Something in my pocket\u2014can\u2019t remember....\u201d\n\n\u201cT\u00edkhon, what did we talk about at dinner?\u201d\n\n\u201cAbout Prince Michael...\u201d\n\n\u201cBe quiet, quiet!\u201d The prince slapped his hand on the table. \u201cYes, I know, Prince Andrew\u2019s letter! Princess Mary read it. Dessalles said something about V\u00edtebsk. Now I\u2019ll read it.\u201d\n\nHe had the letter taken from his pocket and the table\u2014on which stood a glass of lemonade and a spiral wax candle\u2014moved close to the bed, and putting on his spectacles he began reading. Only now in the stillness of the night, reading it by the faint light under the green shade, did he grasp its meaning for a moment.\n\n\u201cThe French at V\u00edtebsk, in four days\u2019 march they may be at Smol\u00e9nsk; perhaps are already there! T\u00edkhon!\u201d T\u00edkhon jumped up. \u201cNo, no, I don\u2019t want anything!\u201d he shouted.\n\nHe put the letter under the candlestick and closed his eyes. And there rose before him the Danube at bright noonday: reeds, the Russian camp, and himself a young general without a wrinkle on his ruddy face, vigorous and alert, entering Pot\u00ebmkin\u2019s gaily colored tent, and a burning sense of jealousy of \u201cthe favorite\u201d agitated him now as strongly as it had done then. He recalled all the words spoken at that first meeting with Pot\u00ebmkin. And he saw before him a plump, rather sallow-faced, short, stout woman, the Empress Mother, with her smile and her words at her first gracious reception of him, and then that same face on the catafalque, and the encounter he had with Z\u00fabov over her coffin about his right to kiss her hand.\n\n\u201cOh, quicker, quicker! To get back to that time and have done with all the present! Quicker, quicker\u2014and that they should leave me in peace!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBald Hills, Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s estate, lay forty miles east from Smol\u00e9nsk and two miles from the main road to Moscow.\n\nThe same evening that the prince gave his instructions to Alp\u00e1tych, Dessalles, having asked to see Princess Mary, told her that, as the prince was not very well and was taking no steps to secure his safety, though from Prince Andrew\u2019s letter it was evident that to remain at Bald Hills might be dangerous, he respectfully advised her to send a letter by Alp\u00e1tych to the Provincial Governor at Smol\u00e9nsk, asking him to let her know the state of affairs and the extent of the danger to which Bald Hills was exposed. Dessalles wrote this letter to the Governor for Princess Mary, she signed it, and it was given to Alp\u00e1tych with instructions to hand it to the Governor and to come back as quickly as possible if there was danger.\n\nHaving received all his orders Alp\u00e1tych, wearing a white beaver hat\u2014a present from the prince\u2014and carrying a stick as the prince did, went out accompanied by his family. Three well-fed roans stood ready harnessed to a small conveyance with a leather hood.\n\nThe larger bell was muffled and the little bells on the harness stuffed with paper. The prince allowed no one at Bald Hills to drive with ringing bells; but on a long journey Alp\u00e1tych liked to have them. His satellites\u2014the senior clerk, a countinghouse clerk, a scullery maid, a cook, two old women, a little pageboy, the coachman, and various domestic serfs\u2014were seeing him off.\n\nHis daughter placed chintz-covered down cushions for him to sit on and behind his back. His old sister-in-law popped in a small bundle, and one of the coachmen helped him into the vehicle.\n\n\u201cThere! There! Women\u2019s fuss! Women, women!\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych, puffing and speaking rapidly just as the prince did, and he climbed into the trap.\n\nAfter giving the clerk orders about the work to be done, Alp\u00e1tych, not trying to imitate the prince now, lifted the hat from his bald head and crossed himself three times.\n\n\u201cIf there is anything... come back, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych! For Christ\u2019s sake think of us!\u201d cried his wife, referring to the rumors of war and the enemy.\n\n\u201cWomen, women! Women\u2019s fuss!\u201d muttered Alp\u00e1tych to himself and started on his journey, looking round at the fields of yellow rye and the still-green, thickly growing oats, and at other quite black fields just being plowed a second time.\n\nAs he went along he looked with pleasure at the year\u2019s splendid crop of corn, scrutinized the strips of ryefield which here and there were already being reaped, made his calculations as to the sowing and the harvest, and asked himself whether he had not forgotten any of the prince\u2019s orders.\n\nHaving baited the horses twice on the way, he arrived at the town toward evening on the fourth of August.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych kept meeting and overtaking baggage trains and troops on the road. As he approached Smol\u00e9nsk he heard the sounds of distant firing, but these did not impress him. What struck him most was the sight of a splendid field of oats in which a camp had been pitched and which was being mown down by the soldiers, evidently for fodder. This fact impressed Alp\u00e1tych, but in thinking about his own business he soon forgot it.\n\nAll the interests of his life for more than thirty years had been bounded by the will of the prince, and he never went beyond that limit. Everything not connected with the execution of the prince\u2019s orders did not interest and did not even exist for Alp\u00e1tych.\n\nOn reaching Smol\u00e9nsk on the evening of the fourth of August he put up in the G\u00e1china suburb across the Dnieper, at the inn kept by Ferap\u00f3ntov, where he had been in the habit of putting up for the last thirty years. Some thirty years ago Ferap\u00f3ntov, by Alp\u00e1tych\u2019s advice, had bought a wood from the prince, had begun to trade, and now had a house, an inn, and a corn dealer\u2019s shop in that province. He was a stout, dark, red-faced peasant in the forties, with thick lips, a broad knob of a nose, similar knobs over his black frowning brows, and a round belly.\n\nWearing a waistcoat over his cotton shirt, Ferap\u00f3ntov was standing before his shop which opened onto the street. On seeing Alp\u00e1tych he went up to him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re welcome, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych. Folks are leaving the town, but you have come to it,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cWhy are they leaving the town?\u201d asked Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what I say. Folks are foolish! Always afraid of the French.\u201d\n\n\u201cWomen\u2019s fuss, women\u2019s fuss!\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cJust what I think, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych. What I say is: orders have been given not to let them in, so that must be right. And the peasants are asking three rubles for carting\u2014it isn\u2019t Christian!\u201d\n\nY\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych heard without heeding. He asked for a samovar and for hay for his horses, and when he had had his tea he went to bed.\n\nAll night long troops were moving past the inn. Next morning Alp\u00e1tych donned a jacket he wore only in town and went out on business. It was a sunny morning and by eight o\u2019clock it was already hot. \u201cA good day for harvesting,\u201d thought Alp\u00e1tych.\n\nFrom beyond the town firing had been heard since early morning. At eight o\u2019clock the booming of cannon was added to the sound of musketry. Many people were hurrying through the streets and there were many soldiers, but cabs were still driving about, tradesmen stood at their shops, and service was being held in the churches as usual. Alp\u00e1tych went to the shops, to government offices, to the post office, and to the Governor\u2019s. In the offices and shops and at the post office everyone was talking about the army and about the enemy who was already attacking the town, everybody was asking what should be done, and all were trying to calm one another.\n\nIn front of the Governor\u2019s house Alp\u00e1tych found a large number of people, Cossacks, and a traveling carriage of the Governor\u2019s. At the porch he met two of the landed gentry, one of whom he knew. This man, an ex-captain of police, was saying angrily:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no joke, you know! It\u2019s all very well if you\u2019re single. \u2018One man though undone is but one,\u2019 as the proverb says, but with thirteen in your family and all the property... They\u2019ve brought us to utter ruin! What sort of governors are they to do that? They ought to be hanged\u2014the brigands!...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh come, that\u2019s enough!\u201d said the other.\n\n\u201cWhat do I care? Let him hear! We\u2019re not dogs,\u201d said the ex-captain of police, and looking round he noticed Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cOh, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych! What have you come for?\u201d\n\n\u201cTo see the Governor by his excellency\u2019s order,\u201d answered Alp\u00e1tych, lifting his head and proudly thrusting his hand into the bosom of his coat as he always did when he mentioned the prince.... \u201cHe has ordered me to inquire into the position of affairs,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cYes, go and find out!\u201d shouted the angry gentleman. \u201cThey\u2019ve brought things to such a pass that there are no carts or anything!... There it is again, do you hear?\u201d said he, pointing in the direction whence came the sounds of firing.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve brought us all to ruin... the brigands!\u201d he repeated, and descended the porch steps.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych swayed his head and went upstairs. In the waiting room were tradesmen, women, and officials, looking silently at one another. The door of the Governor\u2019s room opened and they all rose and moved forward. An official ran out, said some words to a merchant, called a stout official with a cross hanging on his neck to follow him, and vanished again, evidently wishing to avoid the inquiring looks and questions addressed to him. Alp\u00e1tych moved forward and next time the official came out addressed him, one hand placed in the breast of his buttoned coat, and handed him two letters.\n\n\u201cTo his Honor Baron Asch, from General-in-Chief Prince Bolk\u00f3nski,\u201d he announced with such solemnity and significance that the official turned to him and took the letters.\n\nA few minutes later the Governor received Alp\u00e1tych and hurriedly said to him:\n\n\u201cInform the prince and princess that I knew nothing: I acted on the highest instructions\u2014here...\u201d and he handed a paper to Alp\u00e1tych. \u201cStill, as the prince is unwell my advice is that they should go to Moscow. I am just starting myself. Inform them...\u201d\n\nBut the Governor did not finish: a dusty perspiring officer ran into the room and began to say something in French. The Governor\u2019s face expressed terror.\n\n\u201cGo,\u201d he said, nodding his head to Alp\u00e1tych, and began questioning the officer.\n\nEager, frightened, helpless glances were turned on Alp\u00e1tych when he came out of the Governor\u2019s room. Involuntarily listening now to the firing, which had drawn nearer and was increasing in strength, Alp\u00e1tych hurried to his inn. The paper handed to him by the Governor said this:\n\n\u201cI assure you that the town of Smol\u00e9nsk is not in the slightest danger as yet and it is unlikely that it will be threatened with any. I from the one side and Prince Bagrati\u00f3n from the other are marching to unite our forces before Smol\u00e9nsk, which junction will be effected on the 22nd instant, and both armies with their united forces will defend our compatriots of the province entrusted to your care till our efforts shall have beaten back the enemies of our Fatherland, or till the last warrior in our valiant ranks has perished. From this you will see that you have a perfect right to reassure the inhabitants of Smol\u00e9nsk, for those defended by two such brave armies may feel assured of victory.\u201d (Instructions from Barclay de Tolly to Baron Asch, the civil governor of Smol\u00e9nsk, 1812.)\n\nPeople were anxiously roaming about the streets.\n\nCarts piled high with household utensils, chairs, and cupboards kept emerging from the gates of the yards and moving along the streets. Loaded carts stood at the house next to Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s and women were wailing and lamenting as they said good-by. A small watchdog ran round barking in front of the harnessed horses.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych entered the innyard at a quicker pace than usual and went straight to the shed where his horses and trap were. The coachman was asleep. He woke him up, told him to harness, and went into the passage. From the host\u2019s room came the sounds of a child crying, the despairing sobs of a woman, and the hoarse angry shouting of Ferap\u00f3ntov. The cook began running hither and thither in the passage like a frightened hen, just as Alp\u00e1tych entered.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s done her to death. Killed the mistress!... Beat her... dragged her about so!...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat for?\u201d asked Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cShe kept begging to go away. She\u2019s a woman! \u2018Take me away,\u2019 says she, \u2018don\u2019t let me perish with my little children! Folks,\u2019 she says, \u2018are all gone, so why,\u2019 she says, \u2018don\u2019t we go?\u2019 And he began beating and pulling her about so!\u201d\n\nAt these words Alp\u00e1tych nodded as if in approval, and not wishing to hear more went to the door of the room opposite the innkeeper\u2019s, where he had left his purchases.\n\n\u201cYou brute, you murderer!\u201d screamed a thin, pale woman who, with a baby in her arms and her kerchief torn from her head, burst through the door at that moment and down the steps into the yard.\n\nFerap\u00f3ntov came out after her, but on seeing Alp\u00e1tych adjusted his waistcoat, smoothed his hair, yawned, and followed Alp\u00e1tych into the opposite room.\n\n\u201cGoing already?\u201d said he.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych, without answering or looking at his host, sorted his packages and asked how much he owed.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll reckon up! Well, have you been to the Governor\u2019s?\u201d asked Ferap\u00f3ntov. \u201cWhat has been decided?\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych replied that the Governor had not told him anything definite.\n\n\u201cWith our business, how can we get away?\u201d said Ferap\u00f3ntov. \u201cWe\u2019d have to pay seven rubles a cartload to Dorogob\u00fazh and I tell them they\u2019re not Christians to ask it! Seliv\u00e1nov, now, did a good stroke last Thursday\u2014sold flour to the army at nine rubles a sack. Will you have some tea?\u201d he added.\n\nWhile the horses were being harnessed Alp\u00e1tych and Ferap\u00f3ntov over their tea talked of the price of corn, the crops, and the good weather for harvesting.\n\n\u201cWell, it seems to be getting quieter,\u201d remarked Ferap\u00f3ntov, finishing his third cup of tea and getting up. \u201cOurs must have got the best of it. The orders were not to let them in. So we\u2019re in force, it seems.... They say the other day Matthew Iv\u00e1nych Pl\u00e1tov drove them into the river M\u00e1rina and drowned some eighteen thousand in one day.\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych collected his parcels, handed them to the coachman who had come in, and settled up with the innkeeper. The noise of wheels, hoofs, and bells was heard from the gateway as a little trap passed out.\n\nIt was by now late in the afternoon. Half the street was in shadow, the other half brightly lit by the sun. Alp\u00e1tych looked out of the window and went to the door. Suddenly the strange sound of a far-off whistling and thud was heard, followed by a boom of cannon blending into a dull roar that set the windows rattling.\n\nHe went out into the street: two men were running past toward the bridge. From different sides came whistling sounds and the thud of cannon balls and bursting shells falling on the town. But these sounds were hardly heard in comparison with the noise of the firing outside the town and attracted little attention from the inhabitants. The town was being bombarded by a hundred and thirty guns which Napoleon had ordered up after four o\u2019clock. The people did not at once realize the meaning of this bombardment.\n\nAt first the noise of the falling bombs and shells only aroused curiosity. Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s wife, who till then had not ceased wailing under the shed, became quiet and with the baby in her arms went to the gate, listening to the sounds and looking in silence at the people.\n\nThe cook and a shop assistant came to the gate. With lively curiosity everyone tried to get a glimpse of the projectiles as they flew over their heads. Several people came round the corner talking eagerly.\n\n\u201cWhat force!\u201d remarked one. \u201cKnocked the roof and ceiling all to splinters!\u201d\n\n\u201cRouted up the earth like a pig,\u201d said another.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s grand, it bucks one up!\u201d laughed the first. \u201cLucky you jumped aside, or it would have wiped you out!\u201d\n\nOthers joined those men and stopped and told how cannon balls had fallen on a house close to them. Meanwhile still more projectiles, now with the swift sinister whistle of a cannon ball, now with the agreeable intermittent whistle of a shell, flew over people\u2019s heads incessantly, but not one fell close by, they all flew over. Alp\u00e1tych was getting into his trap. The innkeeper stood at the gate.\n\n\u201cWhat are you staring at?\u201d he shouted to the cook, who in her red skirt, with sleeves rolled up, swinging her bare elbows, had stepped to the corner to listen to what was being said.\n\n\u201cWhat marvels!\u201d she exclaimed, but hearing her master\u2019s voice she turned back, pulling down her tucked-up skirt.\n\nOnce more something whistled, but this time quite close, swooping downwards like a little bird; a flame flashed in the middle of the street, something exploded, and the street was shrouded in smoke.\n\n\u201cScoundrel, what are you doing?\u201d shouted the innkeeper, rushing to the cook.\n\nAt that moment the pitiful wailing of women was heard from different sides, the frightened baby began to cry, and people crowded silently with pale faces round the cook. The loudest sound in that crowd was her wailing.\n\n\u201cOh-h-h! Dear souls, dear kind souls! Don\u2019t let me die! My good souls!...\u201d\n\nFive minutes later no one remained in the street. The cook, with her thigh broken by a shell splinter, had been carried into the kitchen. Alp\u00e1tych, his coachman, Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s wife and children and the house porter were all sitting in the cellar, listening. The roar of guns, the whistling of projectiles, and the piteous moaning of the cook, which rose above the other sounds, did not cease for a moment. The mistress rocked and hushed her baby and when anyone came into the cellar asked in a pathetic whisper what had become of her husband who had remained in the street. A shopman who entered told her that her husband had gone with others to the cathedral, whence they were fetching the wonder-working icon of Smol\u00e9nsk.\n\nToward dusk the cannonade began to subside. Alp\u00e1tych left the cellar and stopped in the doorway. The evening sky that had been so clear was clouded with smoke, through which, high up, the sickle of the new moon shone strangely. Now that the terrible din of the guns had ceased a hush seemed to reign over the town, broken only by the rustle of footsteps, the moaning, the distant cries, and the crackle of fires which seemed widespread everywhere. The cook\u2019s moans had now subsided. On two sides black curling clouds of smoke rose and spread from the fires. Through the streets soldiers in various uniforms walked or ran confusedly in different directions like ants from a ruined ant-hill. Several of them ran into Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s yard before Alp\u00e1tych\u2019s eyes. Alp\u00e1tych went out to the gate. A retreating regiment, thronging and hurrying, blocked the street.\n\nNoticing him, an officer said: \u201cThe town is being abandoned. Get away, get away!\u201d and then, turning to the soldiers, shouted:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll teach you to run into the yards!\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych went back to the house, called the coachman, and told him to set off. Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s whole household came out too, following Alp\u00e1tych and the coachman. The women, who had been silent till then, suddenly began to wail as they looked at the fires\u2014the smoke and even the flames of which could be seen in the failing twilight\u2014and as if in reply the same kind of lamentation was heard from other parts of the street. Inside the shed Alp\u00e1tych and the coachman arranged the tangled reins and traces of their horses with trembling hands.\n\nAs Alp\u00e1tych was driving out of the gate he saw some ten soldiers in Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s open shop, talking loudly and filling their bags and knapsacks with flour and sunflower seeds. Just then Ferap\u00f3ntov returned and entered his shop. On seeing the soldiers he was about to shout at them, but suddenly stopped and, clutching at his hair, burst into sobs and laughter:\n\n\u201cLoot everything, lads! Don\u2019t let those devils get it!\u201d he cried, taking some bags of flour himself and throwing them into the street.\n\nSome of the soldiers were frightened and ran away, others went on filling their bags. On seeing Alp\u00e1tych, Ferap\u00f3ntov turned to him:\n\n\u201cRussia is done for!\u201d he cried. \u201cAlp\u00e1tych, I\u2019ll set the place on fire myself. We\u2019re done for!...\u201d and Ferap\u00f3ntov ran into the yard.\n\nSoldiers were passing in a constant stream along the street blocking it completely, so that Alp\u00e1tych could not pass out and had to wait. Ferap\u00f3ntov\u2019s wife and children were also sitting in a cart waiting till it was possible to drive out.\n\nNight had come. There were stars in the sky and the new moon shone out amid the smoke that screened it. On the sloping descent to the Dnieper Alp\u00e1tych\u2019s cart and that of the innkeeper\u2019s wife, which were slowly moving amid the rows of soldiers and of other vehicles, had to stop. In a side street near the crossroads where the vehicles had stopped, a house and some shops were on fire. This fire was already burning itself out. The flames now died down and were lost in the black smoke, now suddenly flared up again brightly, lighting up with strange distinctness the faces of the people crowding at the crossroads. Black figures flitted about before the fire, and through the incessant crackling of the flames talking and shouting could be heard. Seeing that his trap would not be able to move on for some time, Alp\u00e1tych got down and turned into the side street to look at the fire. Soldiers were continually rushing backwards and forwards near it, and he saw two of them and a man in a frieze coat dragging burning beams into another yard across the street, while others carried bundles of hay.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych went up to a large crowd standing before a high barn which was blazing briskly. The walls were all on fire and the back wall had fallen in, the wooden roof was collapsing, and the rafters were alight. The crowd was evidently watching for the roof to fall in, and Alp\u00e1tych watched for it too.\n\n\u201cAlp\u00e1tych!\u201d a familiar voice suddenly hailed the old man.\n\n\u201cMercy on us! Your excellency!\u201d answered Alp\u00e1tych, immediately recognizing the voice of his young prince.\n\nPrince Andrew in his riding cloak, mounted on a black horse, was looking at Alp\u00e1tych from the back of the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYour... your excellency,\u201d stammered Alp\u00e1tych and broke into sobs. \u201cAre we really lost? Master!...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d Prince Andrew repeated.\n\nAt that moment the flames flared up and showed his young master\u2019s pale worn face. Alp\u00e1tych told how he had been sent there and how difficult it was to get away.\n\n\u201cAre we really quite lost, your excellency?\u201d he asked again.\n\nPrince Andrew without replying took out a notebook and raising his knee began writing in pencil on a page he tore out. He wrote to his sister:\n\n\u201cSmol\u00e9nsk is being abandoned. Bald Hills will be occupied by the enemy within a week. Set off immediately for Moscow. Let me know at once when you will start. Send by special messenger to Usvy\u00e1zh.\u201d\n\nHaving written this and given the paper to Alp\u00e1tych, he told him how to arrange for departure of the prince, the princess, his son, and the boy\u2019s tutor, and how and where to let him know immediately. Before he had had time to finish giving these instructions, a chief of staff followed by a suite galloped up to him.\n\n\u201cYou are a colonel?\u201d shouted the chief of staff with a German accent, in a voice familiar to Prince Andrew. \u201cHouses are set on fire in your presence and you stand by! What does this mean? You will answer for it!\u201d shouted Berg, who was now assistant to the chief of staff of the commander of the left flank of the infantry of the first army, a place, as Berg said, \u201cvery agreeable and well en \u00e9vidence.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew looked at him and without replying went on speaking to Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cSo tell them that I shall await a reply till the tenth, and if by the tenth I don\u2019t receive news that they have all got away I shall have to throw up everything and come myself to Bald Hills.\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince,\u201d said Berg, recognizing Prince Andrew, \u201cI only spoke because I have to obey orders, because I always do obey exactly.... You must please excuse me,\u201d he went on apologetically.\n\nSomething cracked in the flames. The fire died down for a moment and wreaths of black smoke rolled from under the roof. There was another terrible crash and something huge collapsed.\n\n\u201cOu-rou-rou!\u201d yelled the crowd, echoing the crash of the collapsing roof of the barn, the burning grain in which diffused a cakelike aroma all around. The flames flared up again, lighting the animated, delighted, exhausted faces of the spectators.\n\nThe man in the frieze coat raised his arms and shouted:\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fine, lads! Now it\u2019s raging... It\u2019s fine!\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the owner himself,\u201d cried several voices.\n\n\u201cWell then,\u201d continued Prince Andrew to Alp\u00e1tych, \u201creport to them as I have told you\u201d; and not replying a word to Berg who was now mute beside him, he touched his horse and rode down the side street.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nFrom Smol\u00e9nsk the troops continued to retreat, followed by the enemy. On the tenth of August the regiment Prince Andrew commanded was marching along the highroad past the avenue leading to Bald Hills. Heat and drought had continued for more than three weeks. Each day fleecy clouds floated across the sky and occasionally veiled the sun, but toward evening the sky cleared again and the sun set in reddish-brown mist. Heavy night dews alone refreshed the earth. The unreaped corn was scorched and shed its grain. The marshes dried up. The cattle lowed from hunger, finding no food on the sun-parched meadows. Only at night and in the forests while the dew lasted was there any freshness. But on the road, the highroad along which the troops marched, there was no such freshness even at night or when the road passed through the forest; the dew was imperceptible on the sandy dust churned up more than six inches deep. As soon as day dawned the march began. The artillery and baggage wagons moved noiselessly through the deep dust that rose to the very hubs of the wheels, and the infantry sank ankle-deep in that soft, choking, hot dust that never cooled even at night. Some of this dust was kneaded by the feet and wheels, while the rest rose and hung like a cloud over the troops, settling in eyes, ears, hair, and nostrils, and worst of all in the lungs of the men and beasts as they moved along that road. The higher the sun rose the higher rose that cloud of dust, and through the screen of its hot fine particles one could look with naked eye at the sun, which showed like a huge crimson ball in the unclouded sky. There was no wind, and the men choked in that motionless atmosphere. They marched with handkerchiefs tied over their noses and mouths. When they passed through a village they all rushed to the wells and fought for the water and drank it down to the mud.\n\nPrince Andrew was in command of a regiment, and the management of that regiment, the welfare of the men and the necessity of receiving and giving orders, engrossed him. The burning of Smol\u00e9nsk and its abandonment made an epoch in his life. A novel feeling of anger against the foe made him forget his own sorrow. He was entirely devoted to the affairs of his regiment and was considerate and kind to his men and officers. In the regiment they called him \u201cour prince,\u201d were proud of him and loved him. But he was kind and gentle only to those of his regiment, to Tim\u00f3khin and the like\u2014people quite new to him, belonging to a different world and who could not know and understand his past. As soon as he came across a former acquaintance or anyone from the staff, he bristled up immediately and grew spiteful, ironical, and contemptuous. Everything that reminded him of his past was repugnant to him, and so in his relations with that former circle he confined himself to trying to do his duty and not to be unfair.\n\nIn truth everything presented itself in a dark and gloomy light to Prince Andrew, especially after the abandonment of Smol\u00e9nsk on the sixth of August (he considered that it could and should have been defended) and after his sick father had had to flee to Moscow, abandoning to pillage his dearly beloved Bald Hills which he had built and peopled. But despite this, thanks to his regiment, Prince Andrew had something to think about entirely apart from general questions. Two days previously he had received news that his father, son, and sister had left for Moscow; and though there was nothing for him to do at Bald Hills, Prince Andrew with a characteristic desire to foment his own grief decided that he must ride there.\n\nHe ordered his horse to be saddled and, leaving his regiment on the march, rode to his father\u2019s estate where he had been born and spent his childhood. Riding past the pond where there used always to be dozens of women chattering as they rinsed their linen or beat it with wooden beetles, Prince Andrew noticed that there was not a soul about and that the little washing wharf, torn from its place and half submerged, was floating on its side in the middle of the pond. He rode to the keeper\u2019s lodge. No one was at the stone entrance gates of the drive and the door stood open. Grass had already begun to grow on the garden paths, and horses and calves were straying in the English park. Prince Andrew rode up to the hothouse; some of the glass panes were broken, and of the trees in tubs some were overturned and others dried up. He called for Tar\u00e1s the gardener, but no one replied. Having gone round the corner of the hothouse to the ornamental garden, he saw that the carved garden fence was broken and branches of the plum trees had been torn off with the fruit. An old peasant whom Prince Andrew in his childhood had often seen at the gate was sitting on a green garden seat, plaiting a bast shoe.\n\nHe was deaf and did not hear Prince Andrew ride up. He was sitting on the seat the old prince used to like to sit on, and beside him strips of bast were hanging on the broken and withered branch of a magnolia.\n\nPrince Andrew rode up to the house. Several limes in the old garden had been cut down and a piebald mare and her foal were wandering in front of the house among the rosebushes. The shutters were all closed, except at one window which was open. A little serf boy, seeing Prince Andrew, ran into the house. Alp\u00e1tych, having sent his family away, was alone at Bald Hills and was sitting indoors reading the Lives of the Saints. On hearing that Prince Andrew had come, he went out with his spectacles on his nose, buttoning his coat, and, hastily stepping up, without a word began weeping and kissing Prince Andrew\u2019s knee.\n\nThen, vexed at his own weakness, he turned away and began to report on the position of affairs. Everything precious and valuable had been removed to Boguch\u00e1rovo. Seventy quarters of grain had also been carted away. The hay and the spring corn, of which Alp\u00e1tych said there had been a remarkable crop that year, had been commandeered by the troops and mown down while still green. The peasants were ruined; some of them too had gone to Boguch\u00e1rovo, only a few remained.\n\nWithout waiting to hear him out, Prince Andrew asked:\n\n\u201cWhen did my father and sister leave?\u201d meaning when did they leave for Moscow.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych, understanding the question to refer to their departure for Boguch\u00e1rovo, replied that they had left on the seventh and again went into details concerning the estate management, asking for instructions.\n\n\u201cAm I to let the troops have the oats, and to take a receipt for them? We have still six hundred quarters left,\u201d he inquired.\n\n\u201cWhat am I to say to him?\u201d thought Prince Andrew, looking down on the old man\u2019s bald head shining in the sun and seeing by the expression on his face that the old man himself understood how untimely such questions were and only asked them to allay his grief.\n\n\u201cYes, let them have it,\u201d replied Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cIf you noticed some disorder in the garden,\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych, \u201cit was impossible to prevent it. Three regiments have been here and spent the night, dragoons mostly. I took down the name and rank of their commanding officer, to hand in a complaint about it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and what are you going to do? Will you stay here if the enemy occupies the place?\u201d asked Prince Andrew.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych turned his face to Prince Andrew, looked at him, and suddenly with a solemn gesture raised his arm.\n\n\u201cHe is my refuge! His will be done!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nA group of bareheaded peasants was approaching across the meadow toward the prince.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by!\u201d said Prince Andrew, bending over to Alp\u00e1tych. \u201cYou must go away too, take away what you can and tell the serfs to go to the Ryaz\u00e1n estate or to the one near Moscow.\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych clung to Prince Andrew\u2019s leg and burst into sobs. Gently disengaging himself, the prince spurred his horse and rode down the avenue at a gallop.\n\nThe old man was still sitting in the ornamental garden, like a fly impassive on the face of a loved one who is dead, tapping the last on which he was making the bast shoe, and two little girls, running out from the hot house carrying in their skirts plums they had plucked from the trees there, came upon Prince Andrew. On seeing the young master, the elder one with frightened look clutched her younger companion by the hand and hid with her behind a birch tree, not stopping to pick up some green plums they had dropped.\n\nPrince Andrew turned away with startled haste, unwilling to let them see that they had been observed. He was sorry for the pretty frightened little girl, was afraid of looking at her, and yet felt an irresistible desire to do so. A new sensation of comfort and relief came over him when, seeing these girls, he realized the existence of other human interests entirely aloof from his own and just as legitimate as those that occupied him. Evidently these girls passionately desired one thing\u2014to carry away and eat those green plums without being caught\u2014and Prince Andrew shared their wish for the success of their enterprise. He could not resist looking at them once more. Believing their danger past, they sprang from their ambush and, chirruping something in their shrill little voices and holding up their skirts, their bare little sunburned feet scampered merrily and quickly across the meadow grass.\n\nPrince Andrew was somewhat refreshed by having ridden off the dusty highroad along which the troops were moving. But not far from Bald Hills he again came out on the road and overtook his regiment at its halting place by the dam of a small pond. It was past one o\u2019clock. The sun, a red ball through the dust, burned and scorched his back intolerably through his black coat. The dust always hung motionless above the buzz of talk that came from the resting troops. There was no wind. As he crossed the dam Prince Andrew smelled the ooze and freshness of the pond. He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter. The small, muddy, green pond had risen visibly more than a foot, flooding the dam, because it was full of the naked white bodies of soldiers with brick-red hands, necks, and faces, who were splashing about in it. All this naked white human flesh, laughing and shrieking, floundered about in that dirty pool like carp stuffed into a watering can, and the suggestion of merriment in that floundering mass rendered it specially pathetic.\n\nOne fair-haired young soldier of the third company, whom Prince Andrew knew and who had a strap round the calf of one leg, crossed himself, stepped back to get a good run, and plunged into the water; another, a dark noncommissioned officer who was always shaggy, stood up to his waist in the water joyfully wriggling his muscular figure and snorted with satisfaction as he poured the water over his head with hands blackened to the wrists. There were sounds of men slapping one another, yelling, and puffing.\n\nEverywhere on the bank, on the dam, and in the pond, there was healthy, white, muscular flesh. The officer, Tim\u00f3khin, with his red little nose, standing on the dam wiping himself with a towel, felt confused at seeing the prince, but made up his mind to address him nevertheless.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very nice, your excellency! Wouldn\u2019t you like to?\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s dirty,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, making a grimace.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll clear it out for you in a minute,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin, and, still undressed, ran off to clear the men out of the pond.\n\n\u201cThe prince wants to bathe.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat prince? Ours?\u201d said many voices, and the men were in such haste to clear out that the prince could hardly stop them. He decided that he would rather wash himself with water in the barn.\n\n\u201cFlesh, bodies, cannon fodder!\u201d he thought, and he looked at his own naked body and shuddered, not from cold but from a sense of disgust and horror he did not himself understand, aroused by the sight of that immense number of bodies splashing about in the dirty pond.\n\n\nOn the seventh of August Prince Bagrati\u00f3n wrote as follows from his quarters at Mikh\u00e1ylovna on the Smol\u00e9nsk road:\n\nDear Count Al\u00e9xis Andr\u00e9evich\u2014(He was writing to Arakch\u00e9ev but knew that his letter would be read by the Emperor, and therefore weighed every word in it to the best of his ability.)\n\nI expect the Minister (Barclay de Tolly) has already reported the abandonment of Smol\u00e9nsk to the enemy. It is pitiable and sad, and the whole army is in despair that this most important place has been wantonly abandoned. I, for my part, begged him personally most urgently and finally wrote him, but nothing would induce him to consent. I swear to you on my honor that Napoleon was in such a fix as never before and might have lost half his army but could not have taken Smol\u00e9nsk. Our troops fought, and are fighting, as never before. With fifteen thousand men I held the enemy at bay for thirty-five hours and beat him; but he would not hold out even for fourteen hours. It is disgraceful, a stain on our army, and as for him, he ought, it seems to me, not to live. If he reports that our losses were great, it is not true; perhaps about four thousand, not more, and not even that; but even were they ten thousand, that\u2019s war! But the enemy has lost masses....\n\nWhat would it have cost him to hold out for another two days? They would have had to retire of their own accord, for they had no water for men or horses. He gave me his word he would not retreat, but suddenly sent instructions that he was retiring that night. We cannot fight in this way, or we may soon bring the enemy to Moscow....\n\nThere is a rumor that you are thinking of peace. God forbid that you should make peace after all our sacrifices and such insane retreats! You would set all Russia against you and everyone of us would feel ashamed to wear the uniform. If it has come to this\u2014we must fight as long as Russia can and as long as there are men able to stand....\n\nOne man ought to be in command, and not two. Your Minister may perhaps be good as a Minister, but as a general he is not merely bad but execrable, yet to him is entrusted the fate of our whole country.... I am really frantic with vexation; forgive my writing boldly. It is clear that the man who advocates the conclusion of a peace, and that the Minister should command the army, does not love our sovereign and desires the ruin of us all. So I write you frankly: call out the militia. For the Minister is leading these visitors after him to Moscow in a most masterly way. The whole army feels great suspicion of the Imperial aide-de-camp Wolzogen. He is said to be more Napoleon\u2019s man than ours, and he is always advising the Minister. I am not merely civil to him but obey him like a corporal, though I am his senior. This is painful, but, loving my benefactor and sovereign, I submit. Only I am sorry for the Emperor that he entrusts our fine army to such as he. Consider that on our retreat we have lost by fatigue and left in the hospital more than fifteen thousand men, and had we attacked this would not have happened. Tell me, for God\u2019s sake, what will Russia, our mother Russia, say to our being so frightened, and why are we abandoning our good and gallant Fatherland to such rabble and implanting feelings of hatred and shame in all our subjects? What are we scared at and of whom are we afraid? I am not to blame that the Minister is vacillating, a coward, dense, dilatory, and has all bad qualities. The whole army bewails it and calls down curses upon him....\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAmong the innumerable categories applicable to the phenomena of human life one may discriminate between those in which substance prevails and those in which form prevails. To the latter\u2014as distinguished from village, country, provincial, or even Moscow life\u2014we may allot Petersburg life, and especially the life of its salons. That life of the salons is unchanging. Since the year 1805 we had made peace and had again quarreled with Bonaparte and had made constitutions and unmade them again, but the salons of Anna P\u00e1vlovna and H\u00e9l\u00e8ne remained just as they had been\u2014the one seven and the other five years before. At Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s they talked with perplexity of Bonaparte\u2019s successes just as before and saw in them and in the subservience shown to him by the European sovereigns a malicious conspiracy, the sole object of which was to cause unpleasantness and anxiety to the court circle of which Anna P\u00e1vlovna was the representative. And in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s salon, which Rumy\u00e1ntsev himself honored with his visits, regarding H\u00e9l\u00e8ne as a remarkably intelligent woman, they talked with the same ecstasy in 1812 as in 1808 of the \u201cgreat nation\u201d and the \u201cgreat man,\u201d and regretted our rupture with France, a rupture which, according to them, ought to be promptly terminated by peace.\n\nOf late, since the Emperor\u2019s return from the army, there had been some excitement in these conflicting salon circles and some demonstrations of hostility to one another, but each camp retained its own tendency. In Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s circle only those Frenchmen were admitted who were deep-rooted legitimists, and patriotic views were expressed to the effect that one ought not to go to the French theater and that to maintain the French troupe was costing the government as much as a whole army corps. The progress of the war was eagerly followed, and only the reports most flattering to our army were circulated. In the French circle of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and Rumy\u00e1ntsev the reports of the cruelty of the enemy and of the war were contradicted and all Napoleon\u2019s attempts at conciliation were discussed. In that circle they discountenanced those who advised hurried preparations for a removal to Kaz\u00e1n of the court and the girls\u2019 educational establishments under the patronage of the Dowager Empress. In H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s circle the war in general was regarded as a series of formal demonstrations which would very soon end in peace, and the view prevailed expressed by Bil\u00edbin\u2014who now in Petersburg was quite at home in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s house, which every clever man was obliged to visit\u2014that not by gunpowder but by those who invented it would matters be settled. In that circle the Moscow enthusiasm\u2014news of which had reached Petersburg simultaneously with the Emperor\u2019s return\u2014was ridiculed sarcastically and very cleverly, though with much caution.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s circle on the contrary was enraptured by this enthusiasm and spoke of it as Plutarch speaks of the deeds of the ancients. Prince Vas\u00edli, who still occupied his former important posts, formed a connecting link between these two circles. He visited his \u201cgood friend Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u201d as well as his daughter\u2019s \u201cdiplomatic salon,\u201d and often in his constant comings and goings between the two camps became confused and said at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s what he should have said at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s and vice versa.\n\nSoon after the Emperor\u2019s return Prince Vas\u00edli in a conversation about the war at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s severely condemned Barclay de Tolly, but was undecided as to who ought to be appointed commander in chief. One of the visitors, usually spoken of as \u201ca man of great merit,\u201d having described how he had that day seen Kut\u00fazov, the newly chosen chief of the Petersburg militia, presiding over the enrollment of recruits at the Treasury, cautiously ventured to suggest that Kut\u00fazov would be the man to satisfy all requirements.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna remarked with a melancholy smile that Kut\u00fazov had done nothing but cause the Emperor annoyance.\n\n\u201cI have talked and talked at the Assembly of the Nobility,\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli interrupted, \u201cbut they did not listen to me. I told them his election as chief of the militia would not please the Emperor. They did not listen to me.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all this mania for opposition,\u201d he went on. \u201cAnd who for? It is all because we want to ape the foolish enthusiasm of those Muscovites,\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli continued, forgetting for a moment that though at H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s one had to ridicule the Moscow enthusiasm, at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s one had to be ecstatic about it. But he retrieved his mistake at once. \u201cNow, is it suitable that Count Kut\u00fazov, the oldest general in Russia, should preside at that tribunal? He will get nothing for his pains! How could they make a man commander in chief who cannot mount a horse, who drops asleep at a council, and has the very worst morals! A good reputation he made for himself at Bucharest! I don\u2019t speak of his capacity as a general, but at a time like this how they appoint a decrepit, blind old man, positively blind? A fine idea to have a blind general! He can\u2019t see anything. To play blindman\u2019s buff? He can\u2019t see at all!\u201d\n\nNo one replied to his remarks.\n\nThis was quite correct on the twenty-fourth of July. But on the twenty-ninth of July Kut\u00fazov received the title of Prince. This might indicate a wish to get rid of him, and therefore Prince Vas\u00edli\u2019s opinion continued to be correct though he was not now in any hurry to express it. But on the eighth of August a committee, consisting of Field Marshal Saltyk\u00f3v, Arakch\u00e9ev, Vyazm\u00edtinov, Lopukh\u00edn, and Kochub\u00e9y met to consider the progress of the war. This committee came to the conclusion that our failures were due to a want of unity in the command and though the members of the committee were aware of the Emperor\u2019s dislike of Kut\u00fazov, after a short deliberation they agreed to advise his appointment as commander in chief. That same day Kut\u00fazov was appointed commander in chief with full powers over the armies and over the whole region occupied by them.\n\nOn the ninth of August Prince Vas\u00edli at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s again met the \u201cman of great merit.\u201d The latter was very attentive to Anna P\u00e1vlovna because he wanted to be appointed director of one of the educational establishments for young ladies. Prince Vas\u00edli entered the room with the air of a happy conqueror who has attained the object of his desires.\n\n\u201cWell, have you heard the great news? Prince Kut\u00fazov is field marshal! All dissensions are at an end! I am so glad, so delighted! At last we have a man!\u201d said he, glancing sternly and significantly round at everyone in the drawing room.\n\nThe \u201cman of great merit,\u201d despite his desire to obtain the post of director, could not refrain from reminding Prince Vas\u00edli of his former opinion. Though this was impolite to Prince Vas\u00edli in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s drawing room, and also to Anna P\u00e1vlovna herself who had received the news with delight, he could not resist the temptation.\n\n\u201cBut, Prince, they say he is blind!\u201d said he, reminding Prince Vas\u00edli of his own words.\n\n\u201cEh? Nonsense! He sees well enough,\u201d said Prince Vas\u00edli rapidly, in a deep voice and with a slight cough\u2014the voice and cough with which he was wont to dispose of all difficulties.\n\n\u201cHe sees well enough,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd what I am so pleased about,\u201d he went on, \u201cis that our sovereign has given him full powers over all the armies and the whole region\u2014powers no commander in chief ever had before. He is a second autocrat,\u201d he concluded with a victorious smile.\n\n\u201cGod grant it! God grant it!\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nThe \u201cman of great merit,\u201d who was still a novice in court circles, wishing to flatter Anna P\u00e1vlovna by defending her former position on this question, observed:\n\n\u201cIt is said that the Emperor was reluctant to give Kut\u00fazov those powers. They say he blushed like a girl to whom Joconde is read, when he said to Kut\u00fazov: \u2018Your Emperor and the Fatherland award you this honor.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cPerhaps the heart took no part in that speech,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\n\u201cOh, no, no!\u201d warmly rejoined Prince Vas\u00edli, who would not now yield Kut\u00fazov to anyone; in his opinion Kut\u00fazov was not only admirable himself, but was adored by everybody. \u201cNo, that\u2019s impossible,\u201d said he, \u201cfor our sovereign appreciated him so highly before.\u201d\n\n\u201cGod grant only that Prince Kut\u00fazov assumes real power and does not allow anyone to put a spoke in his wheel,\u201d observed Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nUnderstanding at once to whom she alluded, Prince Vas\u00edli said in a whisper:\n\n\u201cI know for a fact that Kut\u00fazov made it an absolute condition that the Tsar\u00e9vich should not be with the army. Do you know what he said to the Emperor?\u201d\n\nAnd Prince Vas\u00edli repeated the words supposed to have been spoken by Kut\u00fazov to the Emperor. \u201cI can neither punish him if he does wrong nor reward him if he does right.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, a very wise man is Prince Kut\u00fazov! I have known him a long time!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey even say,\u201d remarked the \u201cman of great merit\u201d who did not yet possess courtly tact, \u201cthat his excellency made it an express condition that the sovereign himself should not be with the army.\u201d\n\nAs soon as he said this both Prince Vas\u00edli and Anna P\u00e1vlovna turned away from him and glanced sadly at one another with a sigh at his na\u00efvet\u00e9.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhile this was taking place in Petersburg the French had already passed Smol\u00e9nsk and were drawing nearer and nearer to Moscow. Napoleon\u2019s historian Thiers, like other of his historians, trying to justify his hero says that he was drawn to the walls of Moscow against his will. He is as right as other historians who look for the explanation of historic events in the will of one man; he is as right as the Russian historians who maintain that Napoleon was drawn to Moscow by the skill of the Russian commanders. Here besides the law of retrospection, which regards all the past as a preparation for events that subsequently occur, the law of reciprocity comes in, confusing the whole matter. A good chessplayer having lost a game is sincerely convinced that his loss resulted from a mistake he made and looks for that mistake in the opening, but forgets that at each stage of the game there were similar mistakes and that none of his moves were perfect. He only notices the mistake to which he pays attention, because his opponent took advantage of it. How much more complex than this is the game of war, which occurs under certain limits of time, and where it is not one will that manipulates lifeless objects, but everything results from innumerable conflicts of various wills!\n\nAfter Smol\u00e9nsk Napoleon sought a battle beyond Dorogob\u00fazh at Vy\u00e1zma, and then at Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche, but it happened that owing to a conjunction of innumerable circumstances the Russians could not give battle till they reached Borodin\u00f3, seventy miles from Moscow. From Vy\u00e1zma Napoleon ordered a direct advance on Moscow.\n\nMoscou, la capitale asiatique de ce grand empire, la ville sacr\u00e9e des peuples d\u2019Alexandre, Moscou avec ses innombrables \u00e9glises en forme de pagodes chinoises, this Moscow gave Napoleon\u2019s imagination no rest. On the march from Vy\u00e1zma to Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche he rode his light bay bobtailed ambler accompanied by his Guards, his bodyguard, his pages, and aides-de-camp. Berthier, his chief of staff, dropped behind to question a Russian prisoner captured by the cavalry. Followed by Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, an interpreter, he overtook Napoleon at a gallop and reined in his horse with an amused expression.\n\n\u201cWell?\u201d asked Napoleon.\n\n\u201cOne of Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s Cossacks says that Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s corps is joining up with the main army and that Kut\u00fazov has been appointed commander in chief. He is a very shrewd and garrulous fellow.\u201d\n\nNapoleon smiled and told them to give the Cossack a horse and bring the man to him. He wished to talk to him himself. Several adjutants galloped off, and an hour later, Lavr\u00fashka, the serf Den\u00edsov had handed over to Rost\u00f3v, rode up to Napoleon in an orderly\u2019s jacket and on a French cavalry saddle, with a merry, and tipsy face. Napoleon told him to ride by his side and began questioning him.\n\n\u201cYou are a Cossack?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, a Cossack, your Honor.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cossack, not knowing in what company he was, for Napoleon\u2019s plain appearance had nothing about it that would reveal to an Oriental mind the presence of a monarch, talked with extreme familiarity of the incidents of the war,\u201d says Thiers, narrating this episode. In reality Lavr\u00fashka, having got drunk the day before and left his master dinnerless, had been whipped and sent to the village in quest of chickens, where he engaged in looting till the French took him prisoner. Lavr\u00fashka was one of those coarse, bare-faced lackeys who have seen all sorts of things, consider it necessary to do everything in a mean and cunning way, are ready to render any sort of service to their master, and are keen at guessing their master\u2019s baser impulses, especially those prompted by vanity and pettiness.\n\nFinding himself in the company of Napoleon, whose identity he had easily and surely recognized, Lavr\u00fashka was not in the least abashed but merely did his utmost to gain his new master\u2019s favor.\n\nHe knew very well that this was Napoleon, but Napoleon\u2019s presence could no more intimidate him than Rost\u00f3v\u2019s, or a sergeant major\u2019s with the rods, would have done, for he had nothing that either the sergeant major or Napoleon could deprive him of.\n\nSo he rattled on, telling all the gossip he had heard among the orderlies. Much of it true. But when Napoleon asked him whether the Russians thought they would beat Bonaparte or not, Lavr\u00fashka screwed up his eyes and considered.\n\nIn this question he saw subtle cunning, as men of his type see cunning in everything, so he frowned and did not answer immediately.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like this,\u201d he said thoughtfully, \u201cif there\u2019s a battle soon, yours will win. That\u2019s right. But if three days pass, then after that, well, then that same battle will not soon be over.\u201d\n\nLelorgne d\u2019Ideville smilingly interpreted this speech to Napoleon thus: \u201cIf a battle takes place within the next three days the French will win, but if later, God knows what will happen.\u201d Napoleon did not smile, though he was evidently in high good humor, and he ordered these words to be repeated.\n\nLavr\u00fashka noticed this and to entertain him further, pretending not to know who Napoleon was, added:\n\n\u201cWe know that you have Bonaparte and that he has beaten everybody in the world, but we are a different matter...\u201d\u2014without knowing why or how this bit of boastful patriotism slipped out at the end.\n\nThe interpreter translated these words without the last phrase, and Bonaparte smiled. \u201cThe young Cossack made his mighty interlocutor smile,\u201d says Thiers. After riding a few paces in silence, Napoleon turned to Berthier and said he wished to see how the news that he was talking to the Emperor himself, to that very Emperor who had written his immortally victorious name on the Pyramids, would affect this enfant du Don.\n\nThe fact was accordingly conveyed to Lavr\u00fashka.\n\nLavr\u00fashka, understanding that this was done to perplex him and that Napoleon expected him to be frightened, to gratify his new masters promptly pretended to be astonished and awe-struck, opened his eyes wide, and assumed the expression he usually put on when taken to be whipped. \u201cAs soon as Napoleon\u2019s interpreter had spoken,\u201d says Thiers, \u201cthe Cossack, seized by amazement, did not utter another word, but rode on, his eyes fixed on the conqueror whose fame had reached him across the steppes of the East. All his loquacity was suddenly arrested and replaced by a na\u00efve and silent feeling of admiration. Napoleon, after making the Cossack a present, had him set free like a bird restored to its native fields.\u201d\n\nNapoleon rode on, dreaming of the Moscow that so appealed to his imagination, and \u201cthe bird restored to its native fields\u201d galloped to our outposts, inventing on the way all that had not taken place but that he meant to relate to his comrades. What had really taken place he did not wish to relate because it seemed to him not worth telling. He found the Cossacks, inquired for the regiment operating with Pl\u00e1tov\u2019s detachment and by evening found his master, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v, quartered at Yank\u00f3vo. Rost\u00f3v was just mounting to go for a ride round the neighboring villages with Ily\u00edn; he let Lavr\u00fashka have another horse and took him along with him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nPrincess Mary was not in Moscow and out of danger as Prince Andrew supposed.\n\nAfter the return of Alp\u00e1tych from Smol\u00e9nsk the old prince suddenly seemed to awake as from a dream. He ordered the militiamen to be called up from the villages and armed, and wrote a letter to the commander in chief informing him that he had resolved to remain at Bald Hills to the last extremity and to defend it, leaving to the commander in chief\u2019s discretion to take measures or not for the defense of Bald Hills, where one of Russia\u2019s oldest generals would be captured or killed, and he announced to his household that he would remain at Bald Hills.\n\nBut while himself remaining, he gave instructions for the departure of the princess and Dessalles with the little prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo and thence to Moscow. Princess Mary, alarmed by her father\u2019s feverish and sleepless activity after his previous apathy, could not bring herself to leave him alone and for the first time in her life ventured to disobey him. She refused to go away and her father\u2019s fury broke over her in a terrible storm. He repeated every injustice he had ever inflicted on her. Trying to convict her, he told her she had worn him out, had caused his quarrel with his son, had harbored nasty suspicions of him, making it the object of her life to poison his existence, and he drove her from his study telling her that if she did not go away it was all the same to him. He declared that he did not wish to remember her existence and warned her not to dare to let him see her. The fact that he did not, as she had feared, order her to be carried away by force but only told her not to let him see her cheered Princess Mary. She knew it was a proof that in the depth of his soul he was glad she was remaining at home and had not gone away.\n\nThe morning after little Nicholas had left, the old prince donned his full uniform and prepared to visit the commander in chief. His cal\u00e8che was already at the door. Princess Mary saw him walk out of the house in his uniform wearing all his orders and go down the garden to review his armed peasants and domestic serfs. She sat by the window listening to his voice which reached her from the garden. Suddenly several men came running up the avenue with frightened faces.\n\nPrincess Mary ran out to the porch, down the flower-bordered path, and into the avenue. A large crowd of militiamen and domestics were moving toward her, and in their midst several men were supporting by the armpits and dragging along a little old man in a uniform and decorations. She ran up to him and, in the play of the sunlight that fell in small round spots through the shade of the lime-tree avenue, could not be sure what change there was in his face. All she could see was that his former stern and determined expression had altered to one of timidity and submission. On seeing his daughter he moved his helpless lips and made a hoarse sound. It was impossible to make out what he wanted. He was lifted up, carried to his study, and laid on the very couch he had so feared of late.\n\nThe doctor, who was fetched that same night, bled him and said that the prince had had a seizure paralyzing his right side.\n\nIt was becoming more and more dangerous to remain at Bald Hills, and next day they moved the prince to Boguch\u00e1rovo, the doctor accompanying him.\n\nBy the time they reached Boguch\u00e1rovo, Dessalles and the little prince had already left for Moscow.\n\nFor three weeks the old prince lay stricken by paralysis in the new house Prince Andrew had built at Boguch\u00e1rovo, ever in the same state, getting neither better nor worse. He was unconscious and lay like a distorted corpse. He muttered unceasingly, his eyebrows and lips twitching, and it was impossible to tell whether he understood what was going on around him or not. One thing was certain\u2014that he was suffering and wished to say something. But what it was, no one could tell: it might be some caprice of a sick and half-crazy man, or it might relate to public affairs, or possibly to family concerns.\n\nThe doctor said this restlessness did not mean anything and was due to physical causes; but Princess Mary thought he wished to tell her something, and the fact that her presence always increased his restlessness confirmed her opinion.\n\nHe was evidently suffering both physically and mentally. There was no hope of recovery. It was impossible for him to travel, it would not do to let him die on the road. \u201cWould it not be better if the end did come, the very end?\u201d Princess Mary sometimes thought. Night and day, hardly sleeping at all, she watched him and, terrible to say, often watched him not with hope of finding signs of improvement but wishing to find symptoms of the approach of the end.\n\nStrange as it was to her to acknowledge this feeling in herself, yet there it was. And what seemed still more terrible to her was that since her father\u2019s illness began (perhaps even sooner, when she stayed with him expecting something to happen), all the personal desires and hopes that had been forgotten or sleeping within her had awakened. Thoughts that had not entered her mind for years\u2014thoughts of a life free from the fear of her father, and even the possibility of love and of family happiness\u2014floated continually in her imagination like temptations of the devil. Thrust them aside as she would, questions continually recurred to her as to how she would order her life now, after that. These were temptations of the devil and Princess Mary knew it. She knew that the sole weapon against him was prayer, and she tried to pray. She assumed an attitude of prayer, looked at the icons, repeated the words of a prayer, but she could not pray. She felt that a different world had now taken possession of her\u2014the life of a world of strenuous and free activity, quite opposed to the spiritual world in which till now she had been confined and in which her greatest comfort had been prayer. She could not pray, could not weep, and worldly cares took possession of her.\n\nIt was becoming dangerous to remain in Boguch\u00e1rovo. News of the approach of the French came from all sides, and in one village, ten miles from Boguch\u00e1rovo, a homestead had been looted by French marauders.\n\nThe doctor insisted on the necessity of moving the prince; the provincial Marshal of the Nobility sent an official to Princess Mary to persuade her to get away as quickly as possible, and the head of the rural police having come to Boguch\u00e1rovo urged the same thing, saying that the French were only some twenty-five miles away, that French proclamations were circulating in the villages, and that if the princess did not take her father away before the fifteenth, he could not answer for the consequences.\n\nThe princess decided to leave on the fifteenth. The cares of preparation and giving orders, for which everyone came to her, occupied her all day. She spent the night of the fourteenth as usual, without undressing, in the room next to the one where the prince lay. Several times, waking up, she heard his groans and muttering, the creak of his bed, and the steps of T\u00edkhon and the doctor when they turned him over. Several times she listened at the door, and it seemed to her that his mutterings were louder than usual and that they turned him over oftener. She could not sleep and several times went to the door and listened, wishing to enter but not deciding to do so. Though he did not speak, Princess Mary saw and knew how unpleasant every sign of anxiety on his account was to him. She had noticed with what dissatisfaction he turned from the look she sometimes involuntarily fixed on him. She knew that her going in during the night at an unusual hour would irritate him.\n\nBut never had she felt so grieved for him or so much afraid of losing him. She recalled all her life with him and in every word and act of his found an expression of his love of her. Occasionally amid these memories temptations of the devil would surge into her imagination: thoughts of how things would be after his death, and how her new, liberated life would be ordered. But she drove these thoughts away with disgust. Toward morning he became quiet and she fell asleep.\n\nShe woke late. That sincerity which often comes with waking showed her clearly what chiefly concerned her about her father\u2019s illness. On waking she listened to what was going on behind the door and, hearing him groan, said to herself with a sigh that things were still the same.\n\n\u201cBut what could have happened? What did I want? I want his death!\u201d she cried with a feeling of loathing for herself.\n\nShe washed, dressed, said her prayers, and went out to the porch. In front of it stood carriages without horses and things were being packed into the vehicles.\n\nIt was a warm, gray morning. Princess Mary stopped at the porch, still horrified by her spiritual baseness and trying to arrange her thoughts before going to her father. The doctor came downstairs and went out to her.\n\n\u201cHe is a little better today,\u201d said he. \u201cI was looking for you. One can make out something of what he is saying. His head is clearer. Come in, he is asking for you....\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary\u2019s heart beat so violently at this news that she grew pale and leaned against the wall to keep from falling. To see him, talk to him, feel his eyes on her now that her whole soul was overflowing with those dreadful, wicked temptations, was a torment of joy and terror.\n\n\u201cCome,\u201d said the doctor.\n\nPrincess Mary entered her father\u2019s room and went up to his bed. He was lying on his back propped up high, and his small bony hands with their knotted purple veins were lying on the quilt; his left eye gazed straight before him, his right eye was awry, and his brows and lips motionless. He seemed altogether so thin, small, and pathetic. His face seemed to have shriveled or melted; his features had grown smaller. Princess Mary went up and kissed his hand. His left hand pressed hers so that she understood that he had long been waiting for her to come. He twitched her hand, and his brows and lips quivered angrily.\n\nShe looked at him in dismay trying to guess what he wanted of her. When she changed her position so that his left eye could see her face he calmed down, not taking his eyes off her for some seconds. Then his lips and tongue moved, sounds came, and he began to speak, gazing timidly and imploringly at her, evidently afraid that she might not understand.\n\nStraining all her faculties Princess Mary looked at him. The comic efforts with which he moved his tongue made her drop her eyes and with difficulty repress the sobs that rose to her throat. He said something, repeating the same words several times. She could not understand them, but tried to guess what he was saying and inquiringly repeated the words he uttered.\n\n\u201cMmm...ar...ate...ate...\u201d he repeated several times.\n\nIt was quite impossible to understand these sounds. The doctor thought he had guessed them, and inquiringly repeated: \u201cMary, are you afraid?\u201d The prince shook his head, again repeated the same sounds.\n\n\u201cMy mind, my mind aches?\u201d questioned Princess Mary.\n\nHe made a mumbling sound in confirmation of this, took her hand, and began pressing it to different parts of his breast as if trying to find the right place for it.\n\n\u201cAlways thoughts... about you... thoughts...\u201d he then uttered much more clearly than he had done before, now that he was sure of being understood.\n\nPrincess Mary pressed her head against his hand, trying to hide her sobs and tears.\n\nHe moved his hand over her hair.\n\n\u201cI have been calling you all night...\u201d he brought out.\n\n\u201cIf only I had known...\u201d she said through her tears. \u201cI was afraid to come in.\u201d\n\nHe pressed her hand.\n\n\u201cWeren\u2019t you asleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I did not sleep,\u201d said Princess Mary, shaking her head.\n\nUnconsciously imitating her father, she now tried to express herself as he did, as much as possible by signs, and her tongue too seemed to move with difficulty.\n\n\u201cDear one... Dearest...\u201d Princess Mary could not quite make out what he had said, but from his look it was clear that he had uttered a tender caressing word such as he had never used to her before. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you come in?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I was wishing for his death!\u201d thought Princess Mary.\n\nHe was silent awhile.\n\n\u201cThank you... daughter dear!... for all, for all... forgive!... thank you!... forgive!... thank you!...\u201d and tears began to flow from his eyes. \u201cCall Andrew!\u201d he said suddenly, and a childish, timid expression of doubt showed itself on his face as he spoke.\n\nHe himself seemed aware that his demand was meaningless. So at least it seemed to Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cI have a letter from him,\u201d she replied.\n\nHe glanced at her with timid surprise.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s with the army, Father, at Smol\u00e9nsk.\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes and remained silent a long time. Then as if in answer to his doubts and to confirm the fact that now he understood and remembered everything, he nodded his head and reopened his eyes.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d he said, softly and distinctly. \u201cRussia has perished. They\u2019ve destroyed her.\u201d\n\nAnd he began to sob, and again tears flowed from his eyes. Princess Mary could no longer restrain herself and wept while she gazed at his face.\n\nAgain he closed his eyes. His sobs ceased, he pointed to his eyes, and T\u00edkhon, understanding him, wiped away the tears.\n\nThen he again opened his eyes and said something none of them could understand for a long time, till at last T\u00edkhon understood and repeated it. Princess Mary had sought the meaning of his words in the mood in which he had just been speaking. She thought he was speaking of Russia, or Prince Andrew, of herself, of his grandson, or of his own death, and so she could not guess his words.\n\n\u201cPut on your white dress. I like it,\u201d was what he said.\n\nHaving understood this Princess Mary sobbed still louder, and the doctor taking her arm led her out to the veranda, soothing her and trying to persuade her to prepare for her journey. When she had left the room the prince again began speaking about his son, about the war, and about the Emperor, angrily twitching his brows and raising his hoarse voice, and then he had a second and final stroke.\n\nPrincess Mary stayed on the veranda. The day had cleared, it was hot and sunny. She could understand nothing, think of nothing and feel nothing, except passionate love for her father, love such as she thought she had never felt till that moment. She ran out sobbing into the garden and as far as the pond, along the avenues of young lime trees Prince Andrew had planted.\n\n\u201cYes... I... I... I wished for his death! Yes, I wanted it to end quicker.... I wished to be at peace.... And what will become of me? What use will peace be when he is no longer here?\u201d Princess Mary murmured, pacing the garden with hurried steps and pressing her hands to her bosom which heaved with convulsive sobs.\n\nWhen she had completed the tour of the garden, which brought her again to the house, she saw Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2014who had remained at Boguch\u00e1rovo and did not wish to leave it\u2014coming toward her with a stranger. This was the Marshal of the Nobility of the district, who had come personally to point out to the princess the necessity for her prompt departure. Princess Mary listened without understanding him; she led him to the house, offered him lunch, and sat down with him. Then, excusing herself, she went to the door of the old prince\u2019s room. The doctor came out with an agitated face and said she could not enter.\n\n\u201cGo away, Princess! Go away... go away!\u201d\n\nShe returned to the garden and sat down on the grass at the foot of the slope by the pond, where no one could see her. She did not know how long she had been there when she was aroused by the sound of a woman\u2019s footsteps running along the path. She rose and saw Duny\u00e1sha her maid, who was evidently looking for her, and who stopped suddenly as if in alarm on seeing her mistress.\n\n\u201cPlease come, Princess... The Prince,\u201d said Duny\u00e1sha in a breaking voice.\n\n\u201cImmediately, I\u2019m coming, I\u2019m coming!\u201d replied the princess hurriedly, not giving Duny\u00e1sha time to finish what she was saying, and trying to avoid seeing the girl she ran toward the house.\n\n\u201cPrincess, it\u2019s God\u2019s will! You must be prepared for everything,\u201d said the Marshal, meeting her at the house door.\n\n\u201cLet me alone; it\u2019s not true!\u201d she cried angrily to him.\n\nThe doctor tried to stop her. She pushed him aside and ran to her father\u2019s door. \u201cWhy are these people with frightened faces stopping me? I don\u2019t want any of them! And what are they doing here?\u201d she thought. She opened the door and the bright daylight in that previously darkened room startled her. In the room were her nurse and other women. They all drew back from the bed, making way for her. He was still lying on the bed as before, but the stern expression of his quiet face made Princess Mary stop short on the threshold.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s not dead\u2014it\u2019s impossible!\u201d she told herself and approached him, and repressing the terror that seized her, she pressed her lips to his cheek. But she stepped back immediately. All the force of the tenderness she had been feeling for him vanished instantly and was replaced by a feeling of horror at what lay there before her. \u201cNo, he is no more! He is not, but here where he was is something unfamiliar and hostile, some dreadful, terrifying, and repellent mystery!\u201d And hiding her face in her hands, Princess Mary sank into the arms of the doctor, who held her up.\n\n\nIn the presence of T\u00edkhon and the doctor the women washed what had been the prince, tied his head up with a handkerchief that the mouth should not stiffen while open, and with another handkerchief tied together the legs that were already spreading apart. Then they dressed him in uniform with his decorations and placed his shriveled little body on a table. Heaven only knows who arranged all this and when, but it all got done as if of its own accord. Toward night candles were burning round his coffin, a pall was spread over it, the floor was strewn with sprays of juniper, a printed band was tucked in under his shriveled head, and in a corner of the room sat a chanter reading the psalms.\n\nJust as horses shy and snort and gather about a dead horse, so the inmates of the house and strangers crowded into the drawing room round the coffin\u2014the Marshal, the village Elder, peasant women\u2014and all with fixed and frightened eyes, crossing themselves, bowed and kissed the old prince\u2019s cold and stiffened hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nUntil Prince Andrew settled in Boguch\u00e1rovo its owners had always been absentees, and its peasants were of quite a different character from those of Bald Hills. They differed from them in speech, dress, and disposition. They were called steppe peasants. The old prince used to approve of them for their endurance at work when they came to Bald Hills to help with the harvest. or to dig ponds and ditches, but he disliked them for their boorishness.\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s last stay at Boguch\u00e1rovo, when he introduced hospitals and schools and reduced the quitrent the peasants had to pay, had not softened their disposition but had on the contrary strengthened in them the traits of character the old prince called boorishness. Various obscure rumors were always current among them: at one time a rumor that they would all be enrolled as Cossacks; at another of a new religion to which they were all to be converted; then of some proclamation of the Tsar\u2019s and of an oath to the Tsar Paul in 1797 (in connection with which it was rumored that freedom had been granted them but the landowners had stopped it), then of Peter F\u00ebdorovich\u2019s return to the throne in seven years\u2019 time, when everything would be made free and so \u201csimple\u201d that there would be no restrictions. Rumors of the war with Bonaparte and his invasion were connected in their minds with the same sort of vague notions of Antichrist, the end of the world, and \u201cpure freedom.\u201d\n\nIn the vicinity of Boguch\u00e1rovo were large villages belonging to the crown or to owners whose serfs paid quitrent and could work where they pleased. There were very few resident landlords in the neighborhood and also very few domestic or literate serfs, and in the lives of the peasantry of those parts the mysterious undercurrents in the life of the Russian people, the causes and meaning of which are so baffling to contemporaries, were more clearly and strongly noticeable than among others. One instance, which had occurred some twenty years before, was a movement among the peasants to emigrate to some unknown \u201cwarm rivers.\u201d Hundreds of peasants, among them the Boguch\u00e1rovo folk, suddenly began selling their cattle and moving in whole families toward the southeast. As birds migrate to somewhere beyond the sea, so these men with their wives and children streamed to the southeast, to parts where none of them had ever been. They set off in caravans, bought their freedom one by one or ran away, and drove or walked toward the \u201cwarm rivers.\u201d Many of them were punished, some sent to Siberia, many died of cold and hunger on the road, many returned of their own accord, and the movement died down of itself just as it had sprung up, without apparent reason. But such undercurrents still existed among the people and gathered new forces ready to manifest themselves just as strangely, unexpectedly, and at the same time simply, naturally, and forcibly. Now in 1812, to anyone living in close touch with these people it was apparent that these undercurrents were acting strongly and nearing an eruption.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych, who had reached Boguch\u00e1rovo shortly before the old prince\u2019s death, noticed an agitation among the peasants, and that contrary to what was happening in the Bald Hills district, where over a radius of forty miles all the peasants were moving away and leaving their villages to be devastated by the Cossacks, the peasants in the steppe region round Boguch\u00e1rovo were, it was rumored, in touch with the French, received leaflets from them that passed from hand to hand, and did not migrate. He learned from domestic serfs loyal to him that the peasant Karp, who possessed great influence in the village commune and had recently been away driving a government transport, had returned with news that the Cossacks were destroying deserted villages, but that the French did not harm them. Alp\u00e1tych also knew that on the previous day another peasant had even brought from the village of Vislo\u00fakhovo, which was occupied by the French, a proclamation by a French general that no harm would be done to the inhabitants, and if they remained they would be paid for anything taken from them. As proof of this the peasant had brought from Vislo\u00fakhovo a hundred rubles in notes (he did not know that they were false) paid to him in advance for hay.\n\nMore important still, Alp\u00e1tych learned that on the morning of the very day he gave the village Elder orders to collect carts to move the princess\u2019 luggage from Boguch\u00e1rovo, there had been a village meeting at which it had been decided not to move but to wait. Yet there was no time to waste. On the fifteenth, the day of the old prince\u2019s death, the Marshal had insisted on Princess Mary\u2019s leaving at once, as it was becoming dangerous. He had told her that after the sixteenth he could not be responsible for what might happen. On the evening of the day the old prince died the Marshal went away, promising to return next day for the funeral. But this he was unable to do, for he received tidings that the French had unexpectedly advanced, and had barely time to remove his own family and valuables from his estate.\n\nFor some thirty years Boguch\u00e1rovo had been managed by the village Elder, Dron, whom the old prince called by the diminutive \u201cDr\u00f3nushka.\u201d\n\nDron was one of those physically and mentally vigorous peasants who grow big beards as soon as they are of age and go on unchanged till they are sixty or seventy, without a gray hair or the loss of a tooth, as straight and strong at sixty as at thirty.\n\nSoon after the migration to the \u201cwarm rivers,\u201d in which he had taken part like the rest, Dron was made village Elder and overseer of Boguch\u00e1rovo, and had since filled that post irreproachably for twenty-three years. The peasants feared him more than they did their master. The masters, both the old prince and the young, and the steward respected him and jestingly called him \u201cthe Minister.\u201d During the whole time of his service Dron had never been drunk or ill, never after sleepless nights or the hardest tasks had he shown the least fatigue, and though he could not read he had never forgotten a single money account or the number of quarters of flour in any of the endless cartloads he sold for the prince, nor a single shock of the whole corn crop on any single acre of the Boguch\u00e1rovo fields.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych, arriving from the devastated Bald Hills estate, sent for his Dron on the day of the prince\u2019s funeral and told him to have twelve horses got ready for the princess\u2019 carriages and eighteen carts for the things to be removed from Boguch\u00e1rovo. Though the peasants paid quitrent, Alp\u00e1tych thought no difficulty would be made about complying with this order, for there were two hundred and thirty households at work in Boguch\u00e1rovo and the peasants were well to do. But on hearing the order Dron lowered his eyes and remained silent. Alp\u00e1tych named certain peasants he knew, from whom he told him to take the carts.\n\nDron replied that the horses of these peasants were away carting. Alp\u00e1tych named others, but they too, according to Dron, had no horses available: some horses were carting for the government, others were too weak, and others had died for want of fodder. It seemed that no horses could be had even for the carriages, much less for the carting.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych looked intently at Dron and frowned. Just as Dron was a model village Elder, so Alp\u00e1tych had not managed the prince\u2019s estates for twenty years in vain. He was a model steward, possessing in the highest degree the faculty of divining the needs and instincts of those he dealt with. Having glanced at Dron he at once understood that his answers did not express his personal views but the general mood of the Boguch\u00e1rovo commune, by which the Elder had already been carried away. But he also knew that Dron, who had acquired property and was hated by the commune, must be hesitating between the two camps: the masters\u2019 and the serfs\u2019. He noticed this hesitation in Dron\u2019s look and therefore frowned and moved closer up to him.\n\n\u201cNow just listen, Dr\u00f3nushka,\u201d said he. \u201cDon\u2019t talk nonsense to me. His excellency Prince Andrew himself gave me orders to move all the people away and not leave them with the enemy, and there is an order from the Tsar about it too. Anyone who stays is a traitor to the Tsar. Do you hear?\u201d\n\n\u201cI hear,\u201d Dron answered without lifting his eyes.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych was not satisfied with this reply.\n\n\u201cEh, Dron, it will turn out badly!\u201d he said, shaking his head.\n\n\u201cThe power is in your hands,\u201d Dron rejoined sadly.\n\n\u201cEh, Dron, drop it!\u201d Alp\u00e1tych repeated, withdrawing his hand from his bosom and solemnly pointing to the floor at Dron\u2019s feet. \u201cI can see through you and three yards into the ground under you,\u201d he continued, gazing at the floor in front of Dron.\n\nDron was disconcerted, glanced furtively at Alp\u00e1tych and again lowered his eyes.\n\n\u201cYou drop this nonsense and tell the people to get ready to leave their homes and go to Moscow and to get carts ready for tomorrow morning for the princess\u2019 things. And don\u2019t go to any meeting yourself, do you hear?\u201d\n\nDron suddenly fell on his knees.\n\n\u201cY\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych, discharge me! Take the keys from me and discharge me, for Christ\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\n\u201cStop that!\u201d cried Alp\u00e1tych sternly. \u201cI see through you and three yards under you,\u201d he repeated, knowing that his skill in beekeeping, his knowledge of the right time to sow the oats, and the fact that he had been able to retain the old prince\u2019s favor for twenty years had long since gained him the reputation of being a wizard, and that the power of seeing three yards under a man is considered an attribute of wizards.\n\nDron got up and was about to say something, but Alp\u00e1tych interrupted him.\n\n\u201cWhat is it you have got into your heads, eh?... What are you thinking of, eh?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat am I to do with the people?\u201d said Dron. \u201cThey\u2019re quite beside themselves; I have already told them...\u201d\n\n\u201c\u2018Told them,\u2019 I dare say!\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych. \u201cAre they drinking?\u201d he asked abruptly.\n\n\u201cQuite beside themselves, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych; they\u2019ve fetched another barrel.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, listen! I\u2019ll go to the police officer, and you tell them so, and that they must stop this and the carts must be got ready.\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand.\u201d\n\nAlp\u00e1tych did not insist further. He had managed people for a long time and knew that the chief way to make them obey is to show no suspicion that they can possibly disobey. Having wrung a submissive \u201cI understand\u201d from Dron, Alp\u00e1tych contented himself with that, though he not only doubted but felt almost certain that without the help of troops the carts would not be forthcoming.\n\nAnd so it was, for when evening came no carts had been provided. In the village, outside the drink shop, another meeting was being held, which decided that the horses should be driven out into the woods and the carts should not be provided. Without saying anything of this to the princess, Alp\u00e1tych had his own belongings taken out of the carts which had arrived from Bald Hills and had those horses got ready for the princess\u2019 carriages. Meanwhile he went himself to the police authorities.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nAfter her father\u2019s funeral Princess Mary shut herself up in her room and did not admit anyone. A maid came to the door to say that Alp\u00e1tych was asking for orders about their departure. (This was before his talk with Dron.) Princess Mary raised herself on the sofa on which she had been lying and replied through the closed door that she did not mean to go away and begged to be left in peace.\n\nThe windows of the room in which she was lying looked westward. She lay on the sofa with her face to the wall, fingering the buttons of the leather cushion and seeing nothing but that cushion, and her confused thoughts were centered on one subject\u2014the irrevocability of death and her own spiritual baseness, which she had not suspected, but which had shown itself during her father\u2019s illness. She wished to pray but did not dare to, dared not in her present state of mind address herself to God. She lay for a long time in that position.\n\nThe sun had reached the other side of the house, and its slanting rays shone into the open window, lighting up the room and part of the morocco cushion at which Princess Mary was looking. The flow of her thoughts suddenly stopped. Unconsciously she sat up, smoothed her hair, got up, and went to the window, involuntarily inhaling the freshness of the clear but windy evening.\n\n\u201cYes, you can well enjoy the evening now! He is gone and no one will hinder you,\u201d she said to herself, and sinking into a chair she let her head fall on the window sill.\n\nSomeone spoke her name in a soft and tender voice from the garden and kissed her head. She looked up. It was Mademoiselle Bourienne in a black dress and weepers. She softly approached Princess Mary, sighed, kissed her, and immediately began to cry. The princess looked up at her. All their former disharmony and her own jealousy recurred to her mind. But she remembered too how he had changed of late toward Mademoiselle Bourienne and could not bear to see her, thereby showing how unjust were the reproaches Princess Mary had mentally addressed to her. \u201cBesides, is it for me, for me who desired his death, to condemn anyone?\u201d she thought.\n\nPrincess Mary vividly pictured to herself the position of Mademoiselle Bourienne, whom she had of late kept at a distance, but who yet was dependent on her and living in her house. She felt sorry for her and held out her hand with a glance of gentle inquiry. Mademoiselle Bourienne at once began crying again and kissed that hand, speaking of the princess\u2019 sorrow and making herself a partner in it. She said her only consolation was the fact that the princess allowed her to share her sorrow, that all the old misunderstandings should sink into nothing but this great grief; that she felt herself blameless in regard to everyone, and that he, from above, saw her affection and gratitude. The princess heard her, not heeding her words but occasionally looking up at her and listening to the sound of her voice.\n\n\u201cYour position is doubly terrible, dear princess,\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne after a pause. \u201cI understand that you could not, and cannot, think of yourself, but with my love for you I must do so.... Has Alp\u00e1tych been to you? Has he spoken to you of going away?\u201d she asked.\n\nPrincess Mary did not answer. She did not understand who was to go or where to. \u201cIs it possible to plan or think of anything now? Is it not all the same?\u201d she thought, and did not reply.\n\n\u201cYou know, ch\u00e8re Marie,\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, \u201cthat we are in danger\u2014are surrounded by the French. It would be dangerous to move now. If we go we are almost sure to be taken prisoners, and God knows...\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary looked at her companion without understanding what she was talking about.\n\n\u201cOh, if anyone knew how little anything matters to me now,\u201d she said. \u201cOf course I would on no account wish to go away from him.... Alp\u00e1tych did say something about going.... Speak to him; I can do nothing, nothing, and don\u2019t want to....\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve spoken to him. He hopes we should be in time to get away tomorrow, but I think it would now be better to stay here,\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne. \u201cBecause, you will agree, ch\u00e8re Marie, to fall into the hands of the soldiers or of riotous peasants would be terrible.\u201d\n\nMademoiselle Bourienne took from her reticule a proclamation (not printed on ordinary Russian paper) of General Rameau\u2019s, telling people not to leave their homes and that the French authorities would afford them proper protection. She handed this to the princess.\n\n\u201cI think it would be best to appeal to that general,\u201d she continued, \u201cand I am sure that all due respect would be shown you.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary read the paper, and her face began to quiver with stifled sobs.\n\n\u201cFrom whom did you get this?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThey probably recognized that I am French, by my name,\u201d replied Mademoiselle Bourienne blushing.\n\nPrincess Mary, with the paper in her hand, rose from the window and with a pale face went out of the room and into what had been Prince Andrew\u2019s study.\n\n\u201cDuny\u00e1sha, send Alp\u00e1tych, or Dr\u00f3nushka, or somebody to me!\u201d she said, \u201cand tell Mademoiselle Bourienne not to come to me,\u201d she added, hearing Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s voice. \u201cWe must go at once, at once!\u201d she said, appalled at the thought of being left in the hands of the French.\n\n\u201cIf Prince Andrew heard that I was in the power of the French! That I, the daughter of Prince Nich", "sequence": 18}, {"offset": 1900000, "text": "olas Bolk\u00f3nski, asked General Rameau for protection and accepted his favor!\u201d This idea horrified her, made her shudder, blush, and feel such a rush of anger and pride as she had never experienced before. All that was distressing, and especially all that was humiliating, in her position rose vividly to her mind. \u201cThey, the French, would settle in this house: M. le G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Rameau would occupy Prince Andrew\u2019s study and amuse himself by looking through and reading his letters and papers. Mademoiselle Bourienne would do the honors of Boguch\u00e1rovo for him. I should be given a small room as a favor, the soldiers would violate my father\u2019s newly dug grave to steal his crosses and stars, they would tell me of their victories over the Russians, and would pretend to sympathize with my sorrow...\u201d thought Princess Mary, not thinking her own thoughts but feeling bound to think like her father and her brother. For herself she did not care where she remained or what happened to her, but she felt herself the representative of her dead father and of Prince Andrew. Involuntarily she thought their thoughts and felt their feelings. What they would have said and what they would have done she felt bound to say and do. She went into Prince Andrew\u2019s study, trying to enter completely into his ideas, and considered her position.\n\nThe demands of life, which had seemed to her annihilated by her father\u2019s death, all at once rose before her with a new, previously unknown force and took possession of her.\n\nAgitated and flushed she paced the room, sending now for Michael Iv\u00e1novich and now for T\u00edkhon or Dron. Duny\u00e1sha, the nurse, and the other maids could not say in how far Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s statement was correct. Alp\u00e1tych was not at home, he had gone to the police. Neither could the architect Michael Iv\u00e1novich, who on being sent for came in with sleepy eyes, tell Princess Mary anything. With just the same smile of agreement with which for fifteen years he had been accustomed to answer the old prince without expressing views of his own, he now replied to Princess Mary, so that nothing definite could be got from his answers. The old valet T\u00edkhon, with sunken, emaciated face that bore the stamp of inconsolable grief, replied: \u201cYes, Princess\u201d to all Princess Mary\u2019s questions and hardly refrained from sobbing as he looked at her.\n\nAt length Dron, the village Elder, entered the room and with a deep bow to Princess Mary came to a halt by the doorpost.\n\nPrincess Mary walked up and down the room and stopped in front of him.\n\n\u201cDr\u00f3nushka,\u201d she said, regarding as a sure friend this Dr\u00f3nushka who always used to bring a special kind of gingerbread from his visit to the fair at Vy\u00e1zma every year and smilingly offer it to her, \u201cDr\u00f3nushka, now since our misfortune...\u201d she began, but could not go on.\n\n\u201cWe are all in God\u2019s hands,\u201d said he, with a sigh.\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\u201cDr\u00f3nushka, Alp\u00e1tych has gone off somewhere and I have no one to turn to. Is it true, as they tell me, that I can\u2019t even go away?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t you go away, your excellency? You can go,\u201d said Dron.\n\n\u201cI was told it would be dangerous because of the enemy. Dear friend, I can do nothing. I understand nothing. I have nobody! I want to go away tonight or early tomorrow morning.\u201d\n\nDron paused. He looked askance at Princess Mary and said: \u201cThere are no horses; I told Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych so.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are there none?\u201d asked the princess.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all God\u2019s scourge,\u201d said Dron. \u201cWhat horses we had have been taken for the army or have died\u2014this is such a year! It\u2019s not a case of feeding horses\u2014we may die of hunger ourselves! As it is, some go three days without eating. We\u2019ve nothing, we\u2019ve been ruined.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary listened attentively to what he told her.\n\n\u201cThe peasants are ruined? They have no bread?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re dying of hunger,\u201d said Dron. \u201cIt\u2019s not a case of carting.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut why didn\u2019t you tell me, Dr\u00f3nushka? Isn\u2019t it possible to help them? I\u2019ll do all I can....\u201d\n\nTo Princess Mary it was strange that now, at a moment when such sorrow was filling her soul, there could be rich people and poor, and the rich could refrain from helping the poor. She had heard vaguely that there was such a thing as \u201clandlord\u2019s corn\u201d which was sometimes given to the peasants. She also knew that neither her father nor her brother would refuse to help the peasants in need, she only feared to make some mistake in speaking about the distribution of the grain she wished to give. She was glad such cares presented themselves, enabling her without scruple to forget her own grief. She began asking Dron about the peasants\u2019 needs and what there was in Boguch\u00e1rovo that belonged to the landlord.\n\n\u201cBut we have grain belonging to my brother?\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThe landlord\u2019s grain is all safe,\u201d replied Dron proudly. \u201cOur prince did not order it to be sold.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it to the peasants, let them have all they need; I give you leave in my brother\u2019s name,\u201d said she.\n\nDron made no answer but sighed deeply.\n\n\u201cGive them that corn if there is enough of it. Distribute it all. I give this order in my brother\u2019s name; and tell them that what is ours is theirs. We do not grudge them anything. Tell them so.\u201d\n\nDron looked intently at the princess while she was speaking.\n\n\u201cDischarge me, little mother, for God\u2019s sake! Order the keys to be taken from me,\u201d said he. \u201cI have served twenty-three years and have done no wrong. Discharge me, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary did not understand what he wanted of her or why he was asking to be discharged. She replied that she had never doubted his devotion and that she was ready to do anything for him and for the peasants.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nAn hour later Duny\u00e1sha came to tell the princess that Dron had come, and all the peasants had assembled at the barn by the princess\u2019 order and wished to have word with their mistress.\n\n\u201cBut I never told them to come,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI only told Dron to let them have the grain.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly, for God\u2019s sake, Princess dear, have them sent away and don\u2019t go out to them. It\u2019s all a trick,\u201d said Duny\u00e1sha, \u201cand when Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych returns let us get away... and please don\u2019t...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is a trick?\u201d asked Princess Mary in surprise.\n\n\u201cI know it is, only listen to me for God\u2019s sake! Ask nurse too. They say they don\u2019t agree to leave Boguch\u00e1rovo as you ordered.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re making some mistake. I never ordered them to go away,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cCall Dr\u00f3nushka.\u201d\n\nDron came and confirmed Duny\u00e1sha\u2019s words; the peasants had come by the princess\u2019 order.\n\n\u201cBut I never sent for them,\u201d declared the princess. \u201cYou must have given my message wrong. I only said that you were to give them the grain.\u201d\n\nDron only sighed in reply.\n\n\u201cIf you order it they will go away,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cNo, no. I\u2019ll go out to them,\u201d said Princess Mary, and in spite of the nurse\u2019s and Duny\u00e1sha\u2019s protests she went out into the porch; Dron, Duny\u00e1sha, the nurse, and Michael Iv\u00e1novich following her.\n\n\u201cThey probably think I am offering them the grain to bribe them to remain here, while I myself go away leaving them to the mercy of the French,\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cI will offer them monthly rations and housing at our Moscow estate. I am sure Andrew would do even more in my place,\u201d she thought as she went out in the twilight toward the crowd standing on the pasture by the barn.\n\nThe men crowded closer together, stirred, and rapidly took off their hats. Princess Mary lowered her eyes and, tripping over her skirt, came close up to them. So many different eyes, old and young, were fixed on her, and there were so many different faces, that she could not distinguish any of them and, feeling that she must speak to them all at once, did not know how to do it. But again the sense that she represented her father and her brother gave her courage, and she boldly began her speech.\n\n\u201cI am very glad you have come,\u201d she said without raising her eyes, and feeling her heart beating quickly and violently. \u201cDr\u00f3nushka tells me that the war has ruined you. That is our common misfortune, and I shall grudge nothing to help you. I am myself going away because it is dangerous here... the enemy is near... because... I am giving you everything, my friends, and I beg you to take everything, all our grain, so that you may not suffer want! And if you have been told that I am giving you the grain to keep you here\u2014that is not true. On the contrary, I ask you to go with all your belongings to our estate near Moscow, and I promise you I will see to it that there you shall want for nothing. You shall be given food and lodging.\u201d\n\nThe princess stopped. Sighs were the only sound heard in the crowd.\n\n\u201cI am not doing this on my own account,\u201d she continued, \u201cI do it in the name of my dead father, who was a good master to you, and of my brother and his son.\u201d\n\nAgain she paused. No one broke the silence.\n\n\u201cOurs is a common misfortune and we will share it together. All that is mine is yours,\u201d she concluded, scanning the faces before her.\n\nAll eyes were gazing at her with one and the same expression. She could not fathom whether it was curiosity, devotion, gratitude, or apprehension and distrust\u2014but the expression on all the faces was identical.\n\n\u201cWe are all very thankful for your bounty, but it won\u2019t do for us to take the landlord\u2019s grain,\u201d said a voice at the back of the crowd.\n\n\u201cBut why not?\u201d asked the princess.\n\nNo one replied and Princess Mary, looking round at the crowd, found that every eye she met now was immediately dropped.\n\n\u201cBut why don\u2019t you want to take it?\u201d she asked again.\n\nNo one answered.\n\nThe silence began to oppress the princess and she tried to catch someone\u2019s eye.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you speak?\u201d she inquired of a very old man who stood just in front of her leaning on his stick. \u201cIf you think something more is wanted, tell me! I will do anything,\u201d said she, catching his eye.\n\nBut as if this angered him, he bent his head quite low and muttered:\n\n\u201cWhy should we agree? We don\u2019t want the grain.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy should we give up everything? We don\u2019t agree. Don\u2019t agree.... We are sorry for you, but we\u2019re not willing. Go away yourself, alone...\u201d came from various sides of the crowd.\n\nAnd again all the faces in that crowd bore an identical expression, though now it was certainly not an expression of curiosity or gratitude, but of angry resolve.\n\n\u201cBut you can\u2019t have understood me,\u201d said Princess Mary with a sad smile. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you want to go? I promise to house and feed you, while here the enemy would ruin you....\u201d\n\nBut her voice was drowned by the voices of the crowd.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not willing. Let them ruin us! We won\u2019t take your grain. We don\u2019t agree.\u201d\n\nAgain Princess Mary tried to catch someone\u2019s eye, but not a single eye in the crowd was turned to her; evidently they were all trying to avoid her look. She felt strange and awkward.\n\n\u201cOh yes, an artful tale! Follow her into slavery! Pull down your houses and go into bondage! I dare say! \u2018I\u2019ll give you grain, indeed!\u2019 she says,\u201d voices in the crowd were heard saying.\n\nWith drooping head Princess Mary left the crowd and went back to the house. Having repeated her order to Dron to have horses ready for her departure next morning, she went to her room and remained alone with her own thoughts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFor a long time that night Princess Mary sat by the open window of her room hearing the sound of the peasants\u2019 voices that reached her from the village, but it was not of them she was thinking. She felt that she could not understand them however much she might think about them. She thought only of one thing, her sorrow, which, after the break caused by cares for the present, seemed already to belong to the past. Now she could remember it and weep or pray.\n\nAfter sunset the wind had dropped. The night was calm and fresh. Toward midnight the voices began to subside, a cock crowed, the full moon began to show from behind the lime trees, a fresh white dewy mist began to rise, and stillness reigned over the village and the house.\n\nPictures of the near past\u2014her father\u2019s illness and last moments\u2014rose one after another to her memory. With mournful pleasure she now lingered over these images, repelling with horror only the last one, the picture of his death, which she felt she could not contemplate even in imagination at this still and mystic hour of night. And these pictures presented themselves to her so clearly and in such detail that they seemed now present, now past, and now future.\n\nShe vividly recalled the moment when he had his first stroke and was being dragged along by his armpits through the garden at Bald Hills, muttering something with his helpless tongue, twitching his gray eyebrows and looking uneasily and timidly at her.\n\n\u201cEven then he wanted to tell me what he told me the day he died,\u201d she thought. \u201cHe had always thought what he said then.\u201d And she recalled in all its detail the night at Bald Hills before he had the last stroke, when with a foreboding of disaster she had remained at home against his will. She had not slept and had stolen downstairs on tiptoe, and going to the door of the conservatory where he slept that night had listened at the door. In a suffering and weary voice he was saying something to T\u00edkhon, speaking of the Crimea and its warm nights and of the Empress. Evidently he had wanted to talk. \u201cAnd why didn\u2019t he call me? Why didn\u2019t he let me be there instead of T\u00edkhon?\u201d Princess Mary had thought and thought again now. \u201cNow he will never tell anyone what he had in his soul. Never will that moment return for him or for me when he might have said all he longed to say, and not T\u00edkhon but I might have heard and understood him. Why didn\u2019t I enter the room?\u201d she thought. \u201cPerhaps he would then have said to me what he said the day he died. While talking to T\u00edkhon he asked about me twice. He wanted to see me, and I was standing close by, outside the door. It was sad and painful for him to talk to T\u00edkhon who did not understand him. I remember how he began speaking to him about Lise as if she were alive\u2014he had forgotten she was dead\u2014and T\u00edkhon reminded him that she was no more, and he shouted, \u2018Fool!\u2019 He was greatly depressed. From behind the door I heard how he lay down on his bed groaning and loudly exclaimed, \u2018My God!\u2019 Why didn\u2019t I go in then? What could he have done to me? What could I have lost? And perhaps he would then have been comforted and would have said that word to me.\u201d And Princess Mary uttered aloud the caressing word he had said to her on the day of his death. \u201cDear-est!\u201d she repeated, and began sobbing, with tears that relieved her soul. She now saw his face before her. And not the face she had known ever since she could remember and had always seen at a distance, but the timid, feeble face she had seen for the first time quite closely, with all its wrinkles and details, when she stooped near to his mouth to catch what he said.\n\n\u201cDear-est!\u201d she repeated again.\n\n\u201cWhat was he thinking when he uttered that word? What is he thinking now?\u201d This question suddenly presented itself to her, and in answer she saw him before her with the expression that was on his face as he lay in his coffin with his chin bound up with a white handkerchief. And the horror that had seized her when she touched him and convinced herself that that was not he, but something mysterious and horrible, seized her again. She tried to think of something else and to pray, but could do neither. With wide-open eyes she gazed at the moonlight and the shadows, expecting every moment to see his dead face, and she felt that the silence brooding over the house and within it held her fast.\n\n\u201cDuny\u00e1sha,\u201d she whispered. \u201cDuny\u00e1sha!\u201d she screamed wildly, and tearing herself out of this silence she ran to the servants\u2019 quarters to meet her old nurse and the maidservants who came running toward her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOn the seventeenth of August Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn, accompanied by Lavr\u00fashka who had just returned from captivity and by an hussar orderly, left their quarters at Yank\u00f3vo, ten miles from Boguch\u00e1rovo, and went for a ride\u2014to try a new horse Ily\u00edn had bought and to find out whether there was any hay to be had in the villages.\n\nFor the last three days Boguch\u00e1rovo had lain between the two hostile armies, so that it was as easy for the Russian rearguard to get to it as for the French vanguard; Rost\u00f3v, as a careful squadron commander, wished to take such provisions as remained at Boguch\u00e1rovo before the French could get them.\n\nRost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn were in the merriest of moods. On the way to Boguch\u00e1rovo, a princely estate with a dwelling house and farm where they hoped to find many domestic serfs and pretty girls, they questioned Lavr\u00fashka about Napoleon and laughed at his stories, and raced one another to try Ily\u00edn\u2019s horse.\n\nRost\u00f3v had no idea that the village he was entering was the property of that very Bolk\u00f3nski who had been engaged to his sister.\n\nRost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn gave rein to their horses for a last race along the incline before reaching Boguch\u00e1rovo, and Rost\u00f3v, outstripping Ily\u00edn, was the first to gallop into the village street.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re first!\u201d cried Ily\u00edn, flushed.\n\n\u201cYes, always first both on the grassland and here,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v, stroking his heated Don\u00e9ts horse.\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019d have won on my Frenchy, your excellency,\u201d said Lavr\u00fashka from behind, alluding to his shabby cart horse, \u201conly I didn\u2019t wish to mortify you.\u201d\n\nThey rode at a footpace to the barn, where a large crowd of peasants was standing.\n\nSome of the men bared their heads, others stared at the new arrivals without doffing their caps. Two tall old peasants with wrinkled faces and scanty beards emerged from the tavern, smiling, staggering, and singing some incoherent song, and approached the officers.\n\n\u201cFine fellows!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v laughing. \u201cIs there any hay here?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd how like one another,\u201d said Ily\u00edn.\n\n\u201cA mo-o-st me-r-r-y co-o-m-pa...!\u201d sang one of the peasants with a blissful smile.\n\nOne of the men came out of the crowd and went up to Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cWho do you belong to?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThe French,\u201d replied Ily\u00edn jestingly, \u201cand here is Napoleon himself\u201d\u2014and he pointed to Lavr\u00fashka.\n\n\u201cThen you are Russians?\u201d the peasant asked again.\n\n\u201cAnd is there a large force of you here?\u201d said another, a short man, coming up.\n\n\u201cVery large,\u201d answered Rost\u00f3v. \u201cBut why have you collected here?\u201d he added. \u201cIs it a holiday?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe old men have met to talk over the business of the commune,\u201d replied the peasant, moving away.\n\nAt that moment, on the road leading from the big house, two women and a man in a white hat were seen coming toward the officers.\n\n\u201cThe one in pink is mine, so keep off!\u201d said Ily\u00edn on seeing Duny\u00e1sha running resolutely toward him.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019ll be ours!\u201d said Lavr\u00fashka to Ily\u00edn, winking.\n\n\u201cWhat do you want, my pretty?\u201d said Ily\u00edn with a smile.\n\n\u201cThe princess ordered me to ask your regiment and your name.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is Count Rost\u00f3v, squadron commander, and I am your humble servant.\u201d\n\n\u201cCo-o-om-pa-ny!\u201d roared the tipsy peasant with a beatific smile as he looked at Ily\u00edn talking to the girl. Following Duny\u00e1sha, Alp\u00e1tych advanced to Rost\u00f3v, having bared his head while still at a distance.\n\n\u201cMay I make bold to trouble your honor?\u201d said he respectfully, but with a shade of contempt for the youthfulness of this officer and with a hand thrust into his bosom. \u201cMy mistress, daughter of General in Chief Prince Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski who died on the fifteenth of this month, finding herself in difficulties owing to the boorishness of these people\u201d\u2014he pointed to the peasants\u2014\u201casks you to come up to the house.... Won\u2019t you, please, ride on a little farther,\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych with a melancholy smile, \u201cas it is not convenient in the presence of...?\u201d He pointed to the two peasants who kept as close to him as horseflies to a horse.\n\n\u201cAh!... Alp\u00e1tych... Ah, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych... Grand! Forgive us for Christ\u2019s sake, eh?\u201d said the peasants, smiling joyfully at him.\n\nRost\u00f3v looked at the tipsy peasants and smiled.\n\n\u201cOr perhaps they amuse your honor?\u201d remarked Alp\u00e1tych with a staid air, as he pointed at the old men with his free hand.\n\n\u201cNo, there\u2019s not much to be amused at here,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, and rode on a little way. \u201cWhat\u2019s the matter?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI make bold to inform your honor that the rude peasants here don\u2019t wish to let the mistress leave the estate, and threaten to unharness her horses, so that though everything has been packed up since morning, her excellency cannot get away.\u201d\n\n\u201cImpossible!\u201d exclaimed Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cI have the honor to report to you the actual truth,\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych.\n\nRost\u00f3v dismounted, gave his horse to the orderly, and followed Alp\u00e1tych to the house, questioning him as to the state of affairs. It appeared that the princess\u2019 offer of corn to the peasants the previous day, and her talk with Dron and at the meeting, had actually had so bad an effect that Dron had finally given up the keys and joined the peasants and had not appeared when Alp\u00e1tych sent for him; and that in the morning when the princess gave orders to harness for her journey, the peasants had come in a large crowd to the barn and sent word that they would not let her leave the village: that there was an order not to move, and that they would unharness the horses. Alp\u00e1tych had gone out to admonish them, but was told (it was chiefly Karp who did the talking, Dron not showing himself in the crowd) that they could not let the princess go, that there was an order to the contrary, but that if she stayed they would serve her as before and obey her in everything.\n\nAt the moment when Rost\u00f3v and Ily\u00edn were galloping along the road, Princess Mary, despite the dissuasions of Alp\u00e1tych, her nurse, and the maids, had given orders to harness and intended to start, but when the cavalrymen were espied they were taken for Frenchmen, the coachman ran away, and the women in the house began to wail.\n\n\u201cFather! Benefactor! God has sent you!\u201d exclaimed deeply moved voices as Rost\u00f3v passed through the anteroom.\n\nPrincess Mary was sitting helpless and bewildered in the large sitting room, when Rost\u00f3v was shown in. She could not grasp who he was and why he had come, or what was happening to her. When she saw his Russian face, and by his walk and the first words he uttered recognized him as a man of her own class, she glanced at him with her deep radiant look and began speaking in a voice that faltered and trembled with emotion. This meeting immediately struck Rost\u00f3v as a romantic event. \u201cA helpless girl overwhelmed with grief, left to the mercy of coarse, rioting peasants! And what a strange fate sent me here! What gentleness and nobility there are in her features and expression!\u201d thought he as he looked at her and listened to her timid story.\n\nWhen she began to tell him that all this had happened the day after her father\u2019s funeral, her voice trembled. She turned away, and then, as if fearing he might take her words as meant to move him to pity, looked at him with an apprehensive glance of inquiry. There were tears in Rost\u00f3v\u2019s eyes. Princess Mary noticed this and glanced gratefully at him with that radiant look which caused the plainness of her face to be forgotten.\n\n\u201cI cannot express, Princess, how glad I am that I happened to ride here and am able to show my readiness to serve you,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v, rising. \u201cGo when you please, and I give you my word of honor that no one shall dare to cause you annoyance if only you will allow me to act as your escort.\u201d And bowing respectfully, as if to a lady of royal blood, he moved toward the door.\n\nRost\u00f3v\u2019s deferential tone seemed to indicate that though he would consider himself happy to be acquainted with her, he did not wish to take advantage of her misfortunes to intrude upon her.\n\nPrincess Mary understood this and appreciated his delicacy.\n\n\u201cI am very, very grateful to you,\u201d she said in French, \u201cbut I hope it was all a misunderstanding and that no one is to blame for it.\u201d She suddenly began to cry.\n\n\u201cExcuse me!\u201d she said.\n\nRost\u00f3v, knitting his brows, left the room with another low bow.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\u201cWell, is she pretty? Ah, friend\u2014my pink one is delicious; her name is Duny\u00e1sha....\u201d\n\nBut on glancing at Rost\u00f3v\u2019s face Ily\u00edn stopped short. He saw that his hero and commander was following quite a different train of thought.\n\nRost\u00f3v glanced angrily at Ily\u00edn and without replying strode off with rapid steps to the village.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll show them; I\u2019ll give it to them, the brigands!\u201d said he to himself.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych at a gliding trot, only just managing not to run, kept up with him with difficulty.\n\n\u201cWhat decision have you been pleased to come to?\u201d said he.\n\nRost\u00f3v stopped and, clenching his fists, suddenly and sternly turned on Alp\u00e1tych.\n\n\u201cDecision? What decision? Old dotard!...\u201d cried he. \u201cWhat have you been about? Eh? The peasants are rioting, and you can\u2019t manage them? You\u2019re a traitor yourself! I know you. I\u2019ll flay you all alive!...\u201d And as if afraid of wasting his store of anger, he left Alp\u00e1tych and went rapidly forward. Alp\u00e1tych, mastering his offended feelings, kept pace with Rost\u00f3v at a gliding gait and continued to impart his views. He said the peasants were obdurate and that at the present moment it would be imprudent to \u201coverresist\u201d them without an armed force, and would it not be better first to send for the military?\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give them armed force... I\u2019ll \u2018overresist\u2019 them!\u201d uttered Rost\u00f3v meaninglessly, breathless with irrational animal fury and the need to vent it.\n\nWithout considering what he would do he moved unconciously with quick, resolute steps toward the crowd. And the nearer he drew to it the more Alp\u00e1tych felt that this unreasonable action might produce good results. The peasants in the crowd were similarly impressed when they saw Rost\u00f3v\u2019s rapid, firm steps and resolute, frowning face.\n\nAfter the hussars had come to the village and Rost\u00f3v had gone to see the princess, a certain confusion and dissension had arisen among the crowd. Some of the peasants said that these new arrivals were Russians and might take it amiss that the mistress was being detained. Dron was of this opinion, but as soon as he expressed it Karp and others attacked their ex-Elder.\n\n\u201cHow many years have you been fattening on the commune?\u201d Karp shouted at him. \u201cIt\u2019s all one to you! You\u2019ll dig up your pot of money and take it away with you.... What does it matter to you whether our homes are ruined or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been told to keep order, and that no one is to leave their homes or take away a single grain, and that\u2019s all about it!\u201d cried another.\n\n\u201cIt was your son\u2019s turn to be conscripted, but no fear! You begrudged your lump of a son,\u201d a little old man suddenly began attacking Dron\u2014\u201cand so they took my V\u00e1nka to be shaved for a soldier! But we all have to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be sure, we all have to die. I\u2019m not against the commune,\u201d said Dron.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it\u2014not against it! You\u2019ve filled your belly....\u201d\n\nThe two tall peasants had their say. As soon as Rost\u00f3v, followed by Ily\u00edn, Lavr\u00fashka, and Alp\u00e1tych, came up to the crowd, Karp, thrusting his fingers into his belt and smiling a little, walked to the front. Dron on the contrary retired to the rear and the crowd drew closer together.\n\n\u201cWho is your Elder here? Hey?\u201d shouted Rost\u00f3v, coming up to the crowd with quick steps.\n\n\u201cThe Elder? What do you want with him?...\u201d asked Karp.\n\nBut before the words were well out of his mouth, his cap flew off and a fierce blow jerked his head to one side.\n\n\u201cCaps off, traitors!\u201d shouted Rost\u00f3v in a wrathful voice. \u201cWhere\u2019s the Elder?\u201d he cried furiously.\n\n\u201cThe Elder.... He wants the Elder!... Dron Zakh\u00e1rych, you!\u201d meek and flustered voices here and there were heard calling and caps began to come off their heads.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t riot, we\u2019re following the orders,\u201d declared Karp, and at that moment several voices began speaking together.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s as the old men have decided\u2014there\u2019s too many of you giving orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cArguing? Mutiny!... Brigands! Traitors!\u201d cried Rost\u00f3v unmeaningly in a voice not his own, gripping Karp by the collar. \u201cBind him, bind him!\u201d he shouted, though there was no one to bind him but Lavr\u00fashka and Alp\u00e1tych.\n\nLavr\u00fashka, however, ran up to Karp and seized him by the arms from behind.\n\n\u201cShall I call up our men from beyond the hill?\u201d he called out.\n\nAlp\u00e1tych turned to the peasants and ordered two of them by name to come and bind Karp. The men obediently came out of the crowd and began taking off their belts.\n\n\u201cWhere\u2019s the Elder?\u201d demanded Rost\u00f3v in a loud voice.\n\nWith a pale and frowning face Dron stepped out of the crowd.\n\n\u201cAre you the Elder? Bind him, Lavr\u00fashka!\u201d shouted Rost\u00f3v, as if that order, too, could not possibly meet with any opposition.\n\nAnd in fact two more peasants began binding Dron, who took off his own belt and handed it to them, as if to aid them.\n\n\u201cAnd you all listen to me!\u201d said Rost\u00f3v to the peasants. \u201cBe off to your houses at once, and don\u2019t let one of your voices be heard!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, we\u2019ve not done any harm! We did it just out of foolishness. It\u2019s all nonsense.... I said then that it was not in order,\u201d voices were heard bickering with one another.\n\n\u201cThere! What did I say?\u201d said Alp\u00e1tych, coming into his own again. \u201cIt\u2019s wrong, lads!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll our stupidity, Y\u00e1kov Alp\u00e1tych,\u201d came the answers, and the crowd began at once to disperse through the village.\n\nThe two bound men were led off to the master\u2019s house. The two drunken peasants followed them.\n\n\u201cAye, when I look at you!...\u201d said one of them to Karp.\n\n\u201cHow can one talk to the masters like that? What were you thinking of, you fool?\u201d added the other\u2014\u201cA real fool!\u201d\n\nTwo hours later the carts were standing in the courtyard of the Boguch\u00e1rovo house. The peasants were briskly carrying out the proprietor\u2019s goods and packing them on the carts, and Dron, liberated at Princess Mary\u2019s wish from the cupboard where he had been confined, was standing in the yard directing the men.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t put it in so carelessly,\u201d said one of the peasants, a man with a round smiling face, taking a casket from a housemaid. \u201cYou know it has cost money! How can you chuck it in like that or shove it under the cord where it\u2019ll get rubbed? I don\u2019t like that way of doing things. Let it all be done properly, according to rule. Look here, put it under the bast matting and cover it with hay\u2014that\u2019s the way!\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, books, books!\u201d said another peasant, bringing out Prince Andrew\u2019s library cupboards. \u201cDon\u2019t catch up against it! It\u2019s heavy, lads\u2014solid books.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, they worked all day and didn\u2019t play!\u201d remarked the tall, round-faced peasant gravely, pointing with a significant wink at the dictionaries that were on the top.\n\n\nUnwilling to obtrude himself on the princess, Rost\u00f3v did not go back to the house but remained in the village awaiting her departure. When her carriage drove out of the house, he mounted and accompanied her eight miles from Boguch\u00e1rovo to where the road was occupied by our troops. At the inn at Yank\u00f3vo he respectfully took leave of her, for the first time permitting himself to kiss her hand.\n\n\u201cHow can you speak so!\u201d he blushingly replied to Princess Mary\u2019s expressions of gratitude for her deliverance, as she termed what had occurred. \u201cAny police officer would have done as much! If we had had only peasants to fight, we should not have let the enemy come so far,\u201d said he with a sense of shame and wishing to change the subject. \u201cI am only happy to have had the opportunity of making your acquaintance. Good-by, Princess. I wish you happiness and consolation and hope to meet you again in happier circumstances. If you don\u2019t want to make me blush, please don\u2019t thank me!\u201d\n\nBut the princess, if she did not again thank him in words, thanked him with the whole expression of her face, radiant with gratitude and tenderness. She could not believe that there was nothing to thank him for. On the contrary, it seemed to her certain that had he not been there she would have perished at the hands of the mutineers and of the French, and that he had exposed himself to terrible and obvious danger to save her, and even more certain was it that he was a man of lofty and noble soul, able to understand her position and her sorrow. His kind, honest eyes, with the tears rising in them when she herself had begun to cry as she spoke of her loss, did not leave her memory.\n\nWhen she had taken leave of him and remained alone she suddenly felt her eyes filling with tears, and then not for the first time the strange question presented itself to her: did she love him?\n\nOn the rest of the way to Moscow, though the princess\u2019 position was not a cheerful one, Duny\u00e1sha, who went with her in the carriage, more than once noticed that her mistress leaned out of the window and smiled at something with an expression of mingled joy and sorrow.\n\n\u201cWell, supposing I do love him?\u201d thought Princess Mary.\n\nAshamed as she was of acknowledging to herself that she had fallen in love with a man who would perhaps never love her, she comforted herself with the thought that no one would ever know it and that she would not be to blame if, without ever speaking of it to anyone, she continued to the end of her life to love the man with whom she had fallen in love for the first and last time in her life.\n\nSometimes when she recalled his looks, his sympathy, and his words, happiness did not appear impossible to her. It was at those moments that Duny\u00e1sha noticed her smiling as she looked out of the carriage window.\n\n\u201cWas it not fate that brought him to Boguch\u00e1rovo, and at that very moment?\u201d thought Princess Mary. \u201cAnd that caused his sister to refuse my brother?\u201d And in all this Princess Mary saw the hand of Providence.\n\nThe impression the princess made on Rost\u00f3v was a very agreeable one. To remember her gave him pleasure, and when his comrades, hearing of his adventure at Boguch\u00e1rovo, rallied him on having gone to look for hay and having picked up one of the wealthiest heiresses in Russia, he grew angry. It made him angry just because the idea of marrying the gentle Princess Mary, who was attractive to him and had an enormous fortune, had against his will more than once entered his head. For himself personally Nicholas could not wish for a better wife: by marrying her he would make the countess his mother happy, would be able to put his father\u2019s affairs in order, and would even\u2014he felt it\u2014ensure Princess Mary\u2019s happiness.\n\nBut S\u00f3nya? And his plighted word? That was why Rost\u00f3v grew angry when he was rallied about Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nOn receiving command of the armies Kut\u00fazov remembered Prince Andrew and sent an order for him to report at headquarters.\n\nPrince Andrew arrived at Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche on the very day and at the very hour that Kut\u00fazov was reviewing the troops for the first time. He stopped in the village at the priest\u2019s house in front of which stood the commander in chief\u2019s carriage, and he sat down on the bench at the gate awaiting his Serene Highness, as everyone now called Kut\u00fazov. From the field beyond the village came now sounds of regimental music and now the roar of many voices shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d to the new commander in chief. Two orderlies, a courier and a major-domo, stood near by, some ten paces from Prince Andrew, availing themselves of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s absence and of the fine weather. A short, swarthy lieutenant colonel of hussars with thick mustaches and whiskers rode up to the gate and, glancing at Prince Andrew, inquired whether his Serene Highness was putting up there and whether he would soon be back.\n\nPrince Andrew replied that he was not on his Serene Highness\u2019 staff but was himself a new arrival. The lieutenant colonel turned to a smart orderly, who, with the peculiar contempt with which a commander in chief\u2019s orderly speaks to officers, replied:\n\n\u201cWhat? His Serene Highness? I expect he\u2019ll be here soon. What do you want?\u201d\n\nThe lieutenant colonel of hussars smiled beneath his mustache at the orderly\u2019s tone, dismounted, gave his horse to a dispatch runner, and approached Bolk\u00f3nski with a slight bow. Bolk\u00f3nski made room for him on the bench and the lieutenant colonel sat down beside him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re also waiting for the commander in chief?\u201d said he. \u201cThey say he weceives evewyone, thank God!... It\u2019s awful with those sausage eaters! Erm\u00f3lov had weason to ask to be pwomoted to be a German! Now p\u2019waps Wussians will get a look in. As it was, devil only knows what was happening. We kept wetweating and wetweating. Did you take part in the campaign?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI had the pleasure,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cnot only of taking part in the retreat but of losing in that retreat all I held dear\u2014not to mention the estate and home of my birth\u2014my father, who died of grief. I belong to the province of Smol\u00e9nsk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh? You\u2019re Pwince Bolk\u00f3nski? Vewy glad to make your acquaintance! I\u2019m Lieutenant Colonel Den\u00edsov, better known as \u2018V\u00e1ska,\u2019\u201d said Den\u00edsov, pressing Prince Andrew\u2019s hand and looking into his face with a particularly kindly attention. \u201cYes, I heard,\u201d said he sympathetically, and after a short pause added: \u201cYes, it\u2019s Scythian warfare. It\u2019s all vewy well\u2014only not for those who get it in the neck. So you are Pwince Andwew Bolk\u00f3nski?\u201d He swayed his head. \u201cVewy pleased, Pwince, to make your acquaintance!\u201d he repeated again, smiling sadly, and he again pressed Prince Andrew\u2019s hand.\n\nPrince Andrew knew Den\u00edsov from what Nat\u00e1sha had told him of her first suitor. This memory carried him sadly and sweetly back to those painful feelings of which he had not thought lately, but which still found place in his soul. Of late he had received so many new and very serious impressions\u2014such as the retreat from Smol\u00e9nsk, his visit to Bald Hills, and the recent news of his father\u2019s death\u2014and had experienced so many emotions, that for a long time past those memories had not entered his mind, and now that they did, they did not act on him with nearly their former strength. For Den\u00edsov, too, the memories awakened by the name of Bolk\u00f3nski belonged to a distant, romantic past, when after supper and after Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s singing he had proposed to a little girl of fifteen without realizing what he was doing. He smiled at the recollection of that time and of his love for Nat\u00e1sha, and passed at once to what now interested him passionately and exclusively. This was a plan of campaign he had devised while serving at the outposts during the retreat. He had proposed that plan to Barclay de Tolly and now wished to propose it to Kut\u00fazov. The plan was based on the fact that the French line of operation was too extended, and it proposed that instead of, or concurrently with, action on the front to bar the advance of the French, we should attack their line of communication. He began explaining his plan to Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cThey can\u2019t hold all that line. It\u2019s impossible. I will undertake to bweak thwough. Give me five hundwed men and I will bweak the line, that\u2019s certain! There\u2019s only one way\u2014guewilla warfare!\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov rose and began gesticulating as he explained his plan to Bolk\u00f3nski. In the midst of his explanation shouts were heard from the army, growing more incoherent and more diffused, mingling with music and songs and coming from the field where the review was held. Sounds of hoofs and shouts were nearing the village.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s coming! He\u2019s coming!\u201d shouted a Cossack standing at the gate.\n\nBolk\u00f3nski and Den\u00edsov moved to the gate, at which a knot of soldiers (a guard of honor) was standing, and they saw Kut\u00fazov coming down the street mounted on a rather small sorrel horse. A huge suite of generals rode behind him. Barclay was riding almost beside him, and a crowd of officers ran after and around them shouting, \u201cHurrah!\u201d\n\nHis adjutants galloped into the yard before him. Kut\u00fazov was impatiently urging on his horse, which ambled smoothly under his weight, and he raised his hand to his white Horse Guard\u2019s cap with a red band and no peak, nodding his head continually. When he came up to the guard of honor, a fine set of Grenadiers mostly wearing decorations, who were giving him the salute, he looked at them silently and attentively for nearly a minute with the steady gaze of a commander and then turned to the crowd of generals and officers surrounding him. Suddenly his face assumed a subtle expression, he shrugged his shoulders with an air of perplexity.\n\n\u201cAnd with such fine fellows to retreat and retreat! Well, good-by, General,\u201d he added, and rode into the yard past Prince Andrew and Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cHurrah! hurrah! hurrah!\u201d shouted those behind him.\n\nSince Prince Andrew had last seen him Kut\u00fazov had grown still more corpulent, flaccid, and fat. But the bleached eyeball, the scar, and the familiar weariness of his expression were still the same. He was wearing the white Horse Guard\u2019s cap and a military overcoat with a whip hanging over his shoulder by a thin strap. He sat heavily and swayed limply on his brisk little horse.\n\n\u201cWhew... whew... whew!\u201d he whistled just audibly as he rode into the yard. His face expressed the relief of relaxed strain felt by a man who means to rest after a ceremony. He drew his left foot out of the stirrup and, lurching with his whole body and puckering his face with the effort, raised it with difficulty onto the saddle, leaned on his knee, groaned, and slipped down into the arms of the Cossacks and adjutants who stood ready to assist him.\n\nHe pulled himself together, looked round, screwing up his eyes, glanced at Prince Andrew, and, evidently not recognizing him, moved with his waddling gait to the porch. \u201cWhew... whew... whew!\u201d he whistled, and again glanced at Prince Andrew. As often occurs with old men, it was only after some seconds that the impression produced by Prince Andrew\u2019s face linked itself up with Kut\u00fazov\u2019s remembrance of his personality.\n\n\u201cAh, how do you do, my dear prince? How do you do, my dear boy? Come along...\u201d said he, glancing wearily round, and he stepped onto the porch which creaked under his weight.\n\nHe unbuttoned his coat and sat down on a bench in the porch.\n\n\u201cAnd how\u2019s your father?\u201d\n\n\u201cI received news of his death, yesterday,\u201d replied Prince Andrew abruptly.\n\nKut\u00fazov looked at him with eyes wide open with dismay and then took off his cap and crossed himself:\n\n\u201cMay the kingdom of Heaven be his! God\u2019s will be done to us all!\u201d He sighed deeply, his whole chest heaving, and was silent for a while. \u201cI loved him and respected him, and sympathize with you with all my heart.\u201d\n\nHe embraced Prince Andrew, pressing him to his fat breast, and for some time did not let him go. When he released him Prince Andrew saw that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s flabby lips were trembling and that tears were in his eyes. He sighed and pressed on the bench with both hands to raise himself.\n\n\u201cCome! Come with me, we\u2019ll have a talk,\u201d said he.\n\nBut at that moment Den\u00edsov, no more intimidated by his superiors than by the enemy, came with jingling spurs up the steps of the porch, despite the angry whispers of the adjutants who tried to stop him. Kut\u00fazov, his hands still pressed on the seat, glanced at him glumly. Den\u00edsov, having given his name, announced that he had to communicate to his Serene Highness a matter of great importance for their country\u2019s welfare. Kut\u00fazov looked wearily at him and, lifting his hands with a gesture of annoyance, folded them across his stomach, repeating the words: \u201cFor our country\u2019s welfare? Well, what is it? Speak!\u201d Den\u00edsov blushed like a girl (it was strange to see the color rise in that shaggy, bibulous, time-worn face) and boldly began to expound his plan of cutting the enemy\u2019s lines of communication between Smol\u00e9nsk and Vy\u00e1zma. Den\u00edsov came from those parts and knew the country well. His plan seemed decidedly a good one, especially from the strength of conviction with which he spoke. Kut\u00fazov looked down at his own legs, occasionally glancing at the door of the adjoining hut as if expecting something unpleasant to emerge from it. And from that hut, while Den\u00edsov was speaking, a general with a portfolio under his arm really did appear.\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, in the midst of Den\u00edsov\u2019s explanations, \u201care you ready so soon?\u201d\n\n\u201cReady, your Serene Highness,\u201d replied the general.\n\nKut\u00fazov swayed his head, as much as to say: \u201cHow is one man to deal with it all?\u201d and again listened to Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cI give my word of honor as a Wussian officer,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, \u201cthat I can bweak Napoleon\u2019s line of communication!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat relation are you to Intendant General Kir\u00edl Andr\u00e9evich Den\u00edsov?\u201d asked Kut\u00fazov, interrupting him.\n\n\u201cHe is my uncle, your Sewene Highness.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, we were friends,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov cheerfully. \u201cAll right, all right, friend, stay here at the staff and tomorrow we\u2019ll have a talk.\u201d\n\nWith a nod to Den\u00edsov he turned away and put out his hand for the papers Konovn\u00edtsyn had brought him.\n\n\u201cWould not your Serene Highness like to come inside?\u201d said the general on duty in a discontented voice, \u201cthe plans must be examined and several papers have to be signed.\u201d\n\nAn adjutant came out and announced that everything was in readiness within. But Kut\u00fazov evidently did not wish to enter that room till he was disengaged. He made a grimace....\n\n\u201cNo, tell them to bring a small table out here, my dear boy. I\u2019ll look at them here,\u201d said he. \u201cDon\u2019t go away,\u201d he added, turning to Prince Andrew, who remained in the porch and listened to the general\u2019s report.\n\nWhile this was being given, Prince Andrew heard the whisper of a woman\u2019s voice and the rustle of a silk dress behind the door. Several times on glancing that way he noticed behind that door a plump, rosy, handsome woman in a pink dress with a lilac silk kerchief on her head, holding a dish and evidently awaiting the entrance of the commander in chief. Kut\u00fazov\u2019s adjutant whispered to Prince Andrew that this was the wife of the priest whose home it was, and that she intended to offer his Serene Highness bread and salt. \u201cHer husband has welcomed his Serene Highness with the cross at the church, and she intends to welcome him in the house.... She\u2019s very pretty,\u201d added the adjutant with a smile. At those words Kut\u00fazov looked round. He was listening to the general\u2019s report\u2014which consisted chiefly of a criticism of the position at Ts\u00e1revo-Zaym\u00edshche\u2014as he had listened to Den\u00edsov, and seven years previously had listened to the discussion at the Austerlitz council of war. He evidently listened only because he had ears which, though there was a piece of tow in one of them, could not help hearing; but it was evident that nothing the general could say would surprise or even interest him, that he knew all that would be said beforehand, and heard it all only because he had to, as one has to listen to the chanting of a service of prayer. All that Den\u00edsov had said was clever and to the point. What the general was saying was even more clever and to the point, but it was evident that Kut\u00fazov despised knowledge and cleverness, and knew of something else that would decide the matter\u2014something independent of cleverness and knowledge. Prince Andrew watched the commander in chief\u2019s face attentively, and the only expression he could see there was one of boredom, curiosity as to the meaning of the feminine whispering behind the door, and a desire to observe propriety. It was evident that Kut\u00fazov despised cleverness and learning and even the patriotic feeling shown by Den\u00edsov, but despised them not because of his own intellect, feelings, or knowledge\u2014he did not try to display any of these\u2014but because of something else. He despised them because of his old age and experience of life. The only instruction Kut\u00fazov gave of his own accord during that report referred to looting by the Russian troops. At the end of the report the general put before him for signature a paper relating to the recovery of payment from army commanders for green oats mown down by the soldiers, when landowners lodged petitions for compensation.\n\nAfter hearing the matter, Kut\u00fazov smacked his lips together and shook his head.\n\n\u201cInto the stove... into the fire with it! I tell you once for all, my dear fellow,\u201d said he, \u201cinto the fire with all such things! Let them cut the crops and burn wood to their hearts\u2019 content. I don\u2019t order it or allow it, but I don\u2019t exact compensation either. One can\u2019t get on without it. \u2018When wood is chopped the chips will fly.\u2019\u201d He looked at the paper again. \u201cOh, this German precision!\u201d he muttered, shaking his head.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov as he signed the last of the documents, and rising heavily and smoothing out the folds in his fat white neck he moved toward the door with a more cheerful expression.\n\nThe priest\u2019s wife, flushing rosy red, caught up the dish she had after all not managed to present at the right moment, though she had so long been preparing for it, and with a low bow offered it to Kut\u00fazov.\n\nHe screwed up his eyes, smiled, lifted her chin with his hand, and said:\n\n\u201cAh, what a beauty! Thank you, sweetheart!\u201d\n\nHe took some gold pieces from his trouser pocket and put them on the dish for her. \u201cWell, my dear, and how are we getting on?\u201d he asked, moving to the door of the room assigned to him. The priest\u2019s wife smiled, and with dimples in her rosy cheeks followed him into the room. The adjutant came out to the porch and asked Prince Andrew to lunch with him. Half an hour later Prince Andrew was again called to Kut\u00fazov. He found him reclining in an armchair, still in the same unbuttoned overcoat. He had in his hand a French book which he closed as Prince Andrew entered, marking the place with a knife. Prince Andrew saw by the cover that it was Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\n\n\u201cWell, sit down, sit down here. Let\u2019s have a talk,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, very sad. But remember, my dear fellow, that I am a father to you, a second father....\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew told Kut\u00fazov all he knew of his father\u2019s death, and what he had seen at Bald Hills when he passed through it.\n\n\u201cWhat... what they have brought us to!\u201d Kut\u00fazov suddenly cried in an agitated voice, evidently picturing vividly to himself from Prince Andrew\u2019s story the condition Russia was in. \u201cBut give me time, give me time!\u201d he said with a grim look, evidently not wishing to continue this agitating conversation, and added: \u201cI sent for you to keep you with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thank your Serene Highness, but I fear I am no longer fit for the staff,\u201d replied Prince Andrew with a smile which Kut\u00fazov noticed.\n\nKut\u00fazov glanced inquiringly at him.\n\n\u201cBut above all,\u201d added Prince Andrew, \u201cI have grown used to my regiment, am fond of the officers, and I fancy the men also like me. I should be sorry to leave the regiment. If I decline the honor of being with you, believe me...\u201d\n\nA shrewd, kindly, yet subtly derisive expression lit up Kut\u00fazov\u2019s podgy face. He cut Bolk\u00f3nski short.\n\n\u201cI am sorry, for I need you. But you\u2019re right, you\u2019re right! It\u2019s not here that men are needed. Advisers are always plentiful, but men are not. The regiments would not be what they are if the would-be advisers served there as you do. I remember you at Austerlitz.... I remember, yes, I remember you with the standard!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, and a flush of pleasure suffused Prince Andrew\u2019s face at this recollection.\n\nTaking his hand and drawing him downwards, Kut\u00fazov offered his cheek to be kissed, and again Prince Andrew noticed tears in the old man\u2019s eyes. Though Prince Andrew knew that Kut\u00fazov\u2019s tears came easily, and that he was particularly tender to and considerate of him from a wish to show sympathy with his loss, yet this reminder of Austerlitz was both pleasant and flattering to him.\n\n\u201cGo your way and God be with you. I know your path is the path of honor!\u201d He paused. \u201cI missed you at Bucharest, but I needed someone to send.\u201d And changing the subject, Kut\u00fazov began to speak of the Turkish war and the peace that had been concluded. \u201cYes, I have been much blamed,\u201d he said, \u201cboth for that war and the peace... but everything came at the right time. Tout vient \u00e0 point \u00e0 celui qui sait attendre. And there were as many advisers there as here...\u201d he went on, returning to the subject of \u201cadvisers\u201d which evidently occupied him. \u201cAh, those advisers!\u201d said he. \u201cIf we had listened to them all we should not have made peace with Turkey and should not have been through with that war. Everything in haste, but more haste, less speed. K\u00e1menski would have been lost if he had not died. He stormed fortresses with thirty thousand men. It is not difficult to capture a fortress but it is difficult to win a campaign. For that, not storming and attacking but patience and time are wanted. K\u00e1menski sent soldiers to Rustchuk, but I only employed these two things and took more fortresses than K\u00e1menski and made them Turks eat horseflesh!\u201d He swayed his head. \u201cAnd the French shall too, believe me,\u201d he went on, growing warmer and beating his chest, \u201cI\u2019ll make them eat horseflesh!\u201d And tears again dimmed his eyes.\n\n\u201cBut shan\u2019t we have to accept battle?\u201d remarked Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWe shall if everybody wants it; it can\u2019t be helped.... But believe me, my dear boy, there is nothing stronger than those two: patience and time, they will do it all. But the advisers n\u2019entendent pas de cette oreille, voil\u00e0 le mal. Some want a thing\u2014others don\u2019t. What\u2019s one to do?\u201d he asked, evidently expecting an answer. \u201cWell, what do you want us to do?\u201d he repeated and his eye shone with a deep, shrewd look. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what to do,\u201d he continued, as Prince Andrew still did not reply: \u201cI will tell you what to do, and what I do. Dans le doute, mon cher,\u201d he paused, \u201cabstiens-toi\u201d\u2014he articulated the French proverb deliberately.\n\n\u201cWell, good-by, my dear fellow; remember that with all my heart I share your sorrow, and that for you I am not a Serene Highness, nor a prince, nor a commander in chief, but a father! If you want anything come straight to me. Good-by, my dear boy.\u201d\n\nAgain he embraced and kissed Prince Andrew, but before the latter had left the room Kut\u00fazov gave a sigh of relief and went on with his unfinished novel, Les Chevaliers du Cygne by Madame de Genlis.\n\nPrince Andrew could not have explained how or why it was, but after that interview with Kut\u00fazov he went back to his regiment reassured as to the general course of affairs and as to the man to whom it had been entrusted. The more he realized the absence of all personal motive in that old man\u2014in whom there seemed to remain only the habit of passions, and in place of an intellect (grouping events and drawing conclusions) only the capacity calmly to contemplate the course of events\u2014the more reassured he was that everything would be as it should. \u201cHe will not bring in any plan of his own. He will not devise or undertake anything,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cbut he will hear everything, remember everything, and put everything in its place. He will not hinder anything useful nor allow anything harmful. He understands that there is something stronger and more important than his own will\u2014the inevitable course of events, and he can see them and grasp their significance, and seeing that significance can refrain from meddling and renounce his personal wish directed to something else. And above all,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, \u201cone believes in him because he\u2019s Russian, despite the novel by Genlis and the French proverbs, and because his voice shook when he said: \u2018What they have brought us to!\u2019 and had a sob in it when he said he would \u2018make them eat horseflesh!\u2019\u201d\n\nOn such feelings, more or less dimly shared by all, the unanimity and general approval were founded with which, despite court influences, the popular choice of Kut\u00fazov as commander in chief was received.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nAfter the Emperor had left Moscow, life flowed on there in its usual course, and its course was so very usual that it was difficult to remember the recent days of patriotic elation and ardor, hard to believe that Russia was really in danger and that the members of the English Club were also sons of the Fatherland ready to sacrifice everything for it. The one thing that recalled the patriotic fervor everyone had displayed during the Emperor\u2019s stay was the call for contributions of men and money, a necessity that as soon as the promises had been made assumed a legal, official form and became unavoidable.\n\nWith the enemy\u2019s approach to Moscow, the Moscovites\u2019 view of their situation did not grow more serious but on the contrary became even more frivolous, as always happens with people who see a great danger approaching. At the approach of danger there are always two voices that speak with equal power in the human soul: one very reasonably tells a man to consider the nature of the danger and the means of escaping it; the other, still more reasonably, says that it is too depressing and painful to think of the danger, since it is not in man\u2019s power to foresee everything and avert the general course of events, and it is therefore better to disregard what is painful till it comes, and to think about what is pleasant. In solitude a man generally listens to the first voice, but in society to the second. So it was now with the inhabitants of Moscow. It was long since people had been as gay in Moscow as that year.\n\nRostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheets, headed by woodcuts of a drink shop, a potman, and a Moscow burgher called Karp\u00fashka Chig\u00edrin, \u201cwho\u2014having been a militiaman and having had rather too much at the pub\u2014heard that Napoleon wished to come to Moscow, grew angry, abused the French in very bad language, came out of the drink shop, and, under the sign of the eagle, began to address the assembled people,\u201d were read and discussed, together with the latest of Vas\u00edli Lv\u00f3vich P\u00fashkin\u2019s bouts rim\u00e9s.\n\nIn the corner room at the Club, members gathered to read these broadsheets, and some liked the way Karp\u00fashka jeered at the French, saying: \u201cThey will swell up with Russian cabbage, burst with our buckwheat porridge, and choke themselves with cabbage soup. They are all dwarfs and one peasant woman will toss three of them with a hayfork.\u201d Others did not like that tone and said it was stupid and vulgar. It was said that Rostopch\u00edn had expelled all Frenchmen and even all foreigners from Moscow, and that there had been some spies and agents of Napoleon among them; but this was told chiefly to introduce Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s witty remark on that occasion. The foreigners were deported to N\u00edzhni by boat, and Rostopch\u00edn had said to them in French: \u201cRentrez en vous-m\u00eames; entrez dans la barque, et n\u2019en faites pas une barque de Charon.\u201d There was talk of all the government offices having been already removed from Moscow, and to this Shinsh\u00edn\u2019s witticism was added\u2014that for that alone Moscow ought to be grateful to Napoleon. It was said that Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s regiment would cost him eight hundred thousand rubles, and that Bez\u00fakhov had spent even more on his, but that the best thing about Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s action was that he himself was going to don a uniform and ride at the head of his regiment without charging anything for the show.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t spare anyone,\u201d said Julie Drubetsk\u00e1ya as she collected and pressed together a bunch of raveled lint with her thin, beringed fingers.\n\nJulie was preparing to leave Moscow next day and was giving a farewell soiree.\n\n\u201cBez\u00fakhov est ridicule, but he is so kind and good-natured. What pleasure is there to be so caustique?\u201d\n\n\u201cA forfeit!\u201d cried a young man in militia uniform whom Julie called \u201cmon chevalier,\u201d and who was going with her to N\u00edzhni.\n\nIn Julie\u2019s set, as in many other circles in Moscow, it had been agreed that they would speak nothing but Russian and that those who made a slip and spoke French should pay fines to the Committee of Voluntary Contributions.\n\n\u201cAnother forfeit for a Gallicism,\u201d said a Russian writer who was present. \u201c\u2018What pleasure is there to be\u2019 is not Russian!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou spare no one,\u201d continued Julie to the young man without heeding the author\u2019s remark.\n\n\u201cFor caustique\u2014I am guilty and will pay, and I am prepared to pay again for the pleasure of telling you the truth. For Gallicisms I won\u2019t be responsible,\u201d she remarked, turning to the author: \u201cI have neither the money nor the time, like Prince Gal\u00edtsyn, to engage a master to teach me Russian!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, here he is!\u201d she added. \u201cQuand on... No, no,\u201d she said to the militia officer, \u201cyou won\u2019t catch me. Speak of the sun and you see its rays!\u201d and she smiled amiably at Pierre. \u201cWe were just talking of you,\u201d she said with the facility in lying natural to a society woman. \u201cWe were saying that your regiment would be sure to be better than Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t talk to me of my regiment,\u201d replied Pierre, kissing his hostess\u2019 hand and taking a seat beside her. \u201cI am so sick of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou will, of course, command it yourself?\u201d said Julie, directing a sly, sarcastic glance toward the militia officer.\n\nThe latter in Pierre\u2019s presence had ceased to be caustic, and his face expressed perplexity as to what Julie\u2019s smile might mean. In spite of his absent-mindedness and good nature, Pierre\u2019s personality immediately checked any attempt to ridicule him to his face.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d said Pierre, with a laughing glance at his big, stout body. \u201cI should make too good a target for the French, besides I am afraid I should hardly be able to climb onto a horse.\u201d\n\nAmong those whom Julie\u2019s guests happened to choose to gossip about were the Rost\u00f3vs.\n\n\u201cI hear that their affairs are in a very bad way,\u201d said Julie. \u201cAnd he is so unreasonable, the count himself I mean. The Razum\u00f3vskis wanted to buy his house and his estate near Moscow, but it drags on and on. He asks too much.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I think the sale will come off in a few days,\u201d said someone. \u201cThough it is madness to buy anything in Moscow now.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy?\u201d asked Julie. \u201cYou don\u2019t think Moscow is in danger?\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why are you leaving?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? What a question! I am going because... well, because everyone is going: and besides\u2014I am not Joan of Arc or an Amazon.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course, of course! Let me have some more strips of linen.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he manages the business properly he will be able to pay off all his debts,\u201d said the militia officer, speaking of Rost\u00f3v.\n\n\u201cA kindly old man but not up to much. And why do they stay on so long in Moscow? They meant to leave for the country long ago. Natalie is quite well again now, isn\u2019t she?\u201d Julie asked Pierre with a knowing smile.\n\n\u201cThey are waiting for their younger son,\u201d Pierre replied. \u201cHe joined Obol\u00e9nski\u2019s Cossacks and went to B\u00e9laya Ts\u00e9rkov where the regiment is being formed. But now they have had him transferred to my regiment and are expecting him every day. The count wanted to leave long ago, but the countess won\u2019t on any account leave Moscow till her son returns.\u201d\n\n\u201cI met them the day before yesterday at the Arkh\u00e1rovs\u2019. Natalie has recovered her looks and is brighter. She sang a song. How easily some people get over everything!\u201d\n\n\u201cGet over what?\u201d inquired Pierre, looking displeased.\n\nJulie smiled.\n\n\u201cYou know, Count, such knights as you are only found in Madame de Souza\u2019s novels.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat knights? What do you mean?\u201d demanded Pierre, blushing.\n\n\u201cOh, come, my dear count! C\u2019est la fable de tout Moscou. Je vous admire, ma parole d\u2019honneur!\u201d\n\n\u201cForfeit, forfeit!\u201d cried the militia officer.\n\n\u201cAll right, one can\u2019t talk\u2014how tiresome!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is \u2018the talk of all Moscow\u2019?\u201d Pierre asked angrily, rising to his feet.\n\n\u201cCome now, Count, you know!\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know anything about it,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cI know you were friendly with Natalie, and so... but I was always more friendly with V\u00e9ra\u2014that dear V\u00e9ra.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, madame!\u201d Pierre continued in a tone of displeasure, \u201cI have not taken on myself the role of Natalie Rost\u00f3va\u2019s knight at all, and have not been to their house for nearly a month. But I cannot understand the cruelty...\u201d\n\n\u201cQui s\u2019excuse s\u2019accuse,\u201d said Julie, smiling and waving the lint triumphantly, and to have the last word she promptly changed the subject. \u201cDo you know what I heard today? Poor Mary Bolk\u00f3nskaya arrived in Moscow yesterday. Do you know that she has lost her father?\u201d\n\n\u201cReally? Where is she? I should like very much to see her,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cI spent the evening with her yesterday. She is going to their estate near Moscow either today or tomorrow morning, with her nephew.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and how is she?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cShe is well, but sad. But do you know who rescued her? It is quite a romance. Nicholas Rost\u00f3v! She was surrounded, and they wanted to kill her and had wounded some of her people. He rushed in and saved her....\u201d\n\n\u201cAnother romance,\u201d said the militia officer. \u201cReally, this general flight has been arranged to get all the old maids married off. Catiche is one and Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya another.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you know, I really believe she is un petit peu amoureuse du jeune homme.\u201d\n\n\u201cForfeit, forfeit, forfeit!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how could one say that in Russian?\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nWhen Pierre returned home he was handed two of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheets that had been brought that day.\n\nThe first declared that the report that Count Rostopch\u00edn had forbidden people to leave Moscow was false; on the contrary he was glad that ladies and tradesmen\u2019s wives were leaving the city. \u201cThere will be less panic and less gossip,\u201d ran the broadsheet \u201cbut I will stake my life on it that that scoundrel will not enter Moscow.\u201d These words showed Pierre clearly for the first time that the French would enter Moscow. The second broadsheet stated that our headquarters were at Vy\u00e1zma, that Count Wittgenstein had defeated the French, but that as many of the inhabitants of Moscow wished to be armed, weapons were ready for them at the arsenal: sabers, pistols, and muskets which could be had at a low price. The tone of the proclamation was not as jocose as in the former Chig\u00edrin talks. Pierre pondered over these broadsheets. Evidently the terrible stormcloud he had desired with the whole strength of his soul but which yet aroused involuntary horror in him was drawing near.\n\n\u201cShall I join the army and enter the service, or wait?\u201d he asked himself for the hundredth time. He took a pack of cards that lay on the table and began to lay them out for a game of patience.\n\n\u201cIf this patience comes out,\u201d he said to himself after shuffling the cards, holding them in his hand, and lifting his head, \u201cif it comes out, it means... what does it mean?\u201d\n\nHe had not decided what it should mean when he heard the voice of the eldest princess at the door asking whether she might come in.\n\n\u201cThen it will mean that I must go to the army,\u201d said Pierre to himself. \u201cCome in, come in!\u201d he added to the princess.\n\nOnly the eldest princess, the one with the stony face and long waist, was still living in Pierre\u2019s house. The two younger ones had both married.\n\n\u201cExcuse my coming to you, cousin,\u201d she said in a reproachful and agitated voice. \u201cYou know some decision must be come to. What is going to happen? Everyone has left Moscow and the people are rioting. How is it that we are staying on?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, things seem satisfactory, ma cousine,\u201d said Pierre in the bantering tone he habitually adopted toward her, always feeling uncomfortable in the role of her benefactor.\n\n\u201cSatisfactory, indeed! Very satisfactory! Barbara Iv\u00e1novna told me today how our troops are distinguishing themselves. It certainly does them credit! And the people too are quite mutinous\u2014they no longer obey, even my maid has taken to being rude. At this rate they will soon begin beating us. One can\u2019t walk in the streets. But, above all, the French will be here any day now, so what are we waiting for? I ask just one thing of you, cousin,\u201d she went on, \u201carrange for me to be taken to Petersburg. Whatever I may be, I can\u2019t live under Bonaparte\u2019s rule.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, come, ma cousine! Where do you get your information from? On the contrary...\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t submit to your Napoleon! Others may if they please.... If you don\u2019t want to do this...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I will, I\u2019ll give the order at once.\u201d\n\nThe princess was apparently vexed at not having anyone to be angry with. Muttering to herself, she sat down on a chair.\n\n\u201cBut you have been misinformed,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cEverything is quiet in the city and there is not the slightest danger. See! I\u2019ve just been reading...\u201d He showed her the broadsheet. \u201cCount Rostopch\u00edn writes that he will stake his life on it that the enemy will not enter Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, that count of yours!\u201d said the princess malevolently. \u201cHe is a hypocrite, a rascal who has himself roused the people to riot. Didn\u2019t he write in those idiotic broadsheets that anyone, \u2018whoever it might be, should be dragged to the lockup by his hair\u2019? (How silly!) \u2018And honor and glory to whoever captures him,\u2019 he says. This is what his cajolery has brought us to! Barbara Iv\u00e1novna told me the mob near killed her because she said something in French.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, but it\u2019s so... You take everything so to heart,\u201d said Pierre, and began laying out his cards for patience.\n\nAlthough that patience did come out, Pierre did not join the army, but remained in deserted Moscow ever in the same state of agitation, irresolution, and alarm, yet at the same time joyfully expecting something terrible.\n\nNext day toward evening the princess set off, and Pierre\u2019s head steward came to inform him that the money needed for the equipment of his regiment could not be found without selling one of the estates. In general the head steward made out to Pierre that his project of raising a regiment would ruin him. Pierre listened to him, scarcely able to repress a smile.\n\n\u201cWell then, sell it,\u201d said he. \u201cWhat\u2019s to be done? I can\u2019t draw back now!\u201d\n\nThe worse everything became, especially his own affairs, the better was Pierre pleased and the more evident was it that the catastrophe he expected was approaching. Hardly anyone he knew was left in town. Julie had gone, and so had Princess Mary. Of his intimate friends only the Rost\u00f3vs remained, but he did not go to see them.\n\nTo distract his thoughts he drove that day to the village of Voronts\u00f3vo to see the great balloon Leppich was constructing to destroy the foe, and a trial balloon that was to go up next day. The balloon was not yet ready, but Pierre learned that it was being constructed by the Emperor\u2019s desire. The Emperor had written to Count Rostopch\u00edn as follows:\n\nAs soon as Leppich is ready, get together a crew of reliable and intelligent men for his car and send a courier to General Kut\u00fazov to let him know. I have informed him of the matter.\n\nPlease impress upon Leppich to be very careful where he descends for the first time, that he may not make a mistake and fall into the enemy\u2019s hands. It is essential for him to combine his movements with those of the commander in chief.\n\n\nOn his way home from Voronts\u00f3vo, as he was passing the Bol\u00f3tnoe Place Pierre, seeing a large crowd round the L\u00f3bnoe Place, stopped and got out of his trap. A French cook accused of being a spy was being flogged. The flogging was only just over, and the executioner was releasing from the flogging bench a stout man with red whiskers, in blue stockings and a green jacket, who was moaning piteously. Another criminal, thin and pale, stood near. Judging by their faces they were both Frenchmen. With a frightened and suffering look resembling that on the thin Frenchman\u2019s face, Pierre pushed his way in through the crowd.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? Who is it? What is it for?\u201d he kept asking.\n\nBut the attention of the crowd\u2014officials, burghers, shopkeepers, peasants, and women in cloaks and in pelisses\u2014was so eagerly centered on what was passing in L\u00f3bnoe Place that no one answered him. The stout man rose, frowned, shrugged his shoulders, and evidently trying to appear firm began to pull on his jacket without looking about him, but suddenly his lips trembled and he began to cry, in the way full-blooded grown-up men cry, though angry with himself for doing so. In the crowd people began talking loudly, to stifle their feelings of pity as it seemed to Pierre.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cook to some prince.\u201d\n\n\u201cEh, mounseer, Russian sauce seems to be sour to a Frenchman... sets his teeth on edge!\u201d said a wrinkled clerk who was standing behind Pierre, when the Frenchman began to cry.\n\nThe clerk glanced round, evidently hoping that his joke would be appreciated. Some people began to laugh, others continued to watch in dismay the executioner who was undressing the other man.\n\nPierre choked, his face puckered, and he turned hastily away, went back to his trap muttering something to himself as he went, and took his seat. As they drove along he shuddered and exclaimed several times so audibly that the coachman asked him:\n\n\u201cWhat is your pleasure?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you going?\u201d shouted Pierre to the man, who was driving to Luby\u00e1nka Street.\n\n\u201cTo the Governor\u2019s, as you ordered,\u201d answered the coachman.\n\n\u201cFool! Idiot!\u201d shouted Pierre, abusing his coachman\u2014a thing he rarely did. \u201cHome, I told you! And drive faster, blockhead!\u201d \u201cI must get away this very day,\u201d he murmured to himself.\n\nAt the sight of the tortured Frenchman and the crowd surrounding the L\u00f3bnoe Place, Pierre had so definitely made up his mind that he could no longer remain in Moscow and would leave for the army that very day that it seemed to him that either he had told the coachman this or that the man ought to have known it for himself.\n\nOn reaching home Pierre gave orders to Evst\u00e1fey\u2014his head coachman who knew everything, could do anything, and was known to all Moscow\u2014that he would leave that night for the army at Mozh\u00e1ysk, and that his saddle horses should be sent there. This could not all be arranged that day, so on Evst\u00e1fey\u2019s representation Pierre had to put off his departure till next day to allow time for the relay horses to be sent on in advance.\n\nOn the twenty-fourth the weather cleared up after a spell of rain, and after dinner Pierre left Moscow. When changing horses that night in Perkh\u00fashkovo, he learned that there had been a great battle that evening. (This was the battle of Shev\u00e1rdino.) He was told that there in Perkh\u00fashkovo the earth trembled from the firing, but nobody could answer his questions as to who had won. At dawn next day Pierre was approaching Mozh\u00e1ysk.\n\nEvery house in Mozh\u00e1ysk had soldiers quartered in it, and at the hostel where Pierre was met by his groom and coachman there was no room to be had. It was full of officers.\n\nEverywhere in Mozh\u00e1ysk and beyond it, troops were stationed or on the march. Cossacks, foot and horse soldiers, wagons, caissons, and cannon were everywhere. Pierre pushed forward as fast as he could, and the farther he left Moscow behind and the deeper he plunged into that sea of troops the more was he overcome by restless agitation and a new and joyful feeling he had not experienced before. It was a feeling akin to what he had felt at the Slob\u00f3da Palace during the Emperor\u2019s visit\u2014a sense of the necessity of undertaking something and sacrificing something. He now experienced a glad consciousness that everything that constitutes men\u2019s happiness\u2014the comforts of life, wealth, even life itself\u2014is rubbish it is pleasant to throw away, compared with something... With what? Pierre could not say, and he did not try to determine for whom and for what he felt such particular delight in sacrificing everything. He was not occupied with the question of what to sacrifice for; the fact of sacrificing in itself afforded him a new and joyous sensation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nOn the twenty-fourth of August the battle of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt was fought, on the twenty-fifth not a shot was fired by either side, and on the twenty-sixth the battle of Borodin\u00f3 itself took place.\n\nWhy and how were the battles of Shev\u00e1rdino and Borodin\u00f3 given and accepted? Why was the battle of Borodin\u00f3 fought? There was not the least sense in it for either the French or the Russians. Its immediate result for the Russians was, and was bound to be, that we were brought nearer to the destruction of Moscow\u2014which we feared more than anything in the world; and for the French its immediate result was that they were brought nearer to the destruction of their whole army\u2014which they feared more than anything in the world. What the result must be was quite obvious, and yet Napoleon offered and Kut\u00fazov accepted that battle.\n\nIf the commanders had been guided by reason, it would seem that it must have been obvious to Napoleon that by advancing thirteen hundred miles and giving battle with a probability of losing a quarter of his army, he was advancing to certain destruction, and it must have been equally clear to Kut\u00fazov that by accepting battle and risking the loss of a quarter of his army he would certainly lose Moscow. For Kut\u00fazov this was mathematically clear, as it is that if when playing draughts I have one man less and go on exchanging, I shall certainly lose, and therefore should not exchange. When my opponent has sixteen men and I have fourteen, I am only one eighth weaker than he, but when I have exchanged thirteen more men he will be three times as strong as I am.\n\nBefore the battle of Borodin\u00f3 our strength in proportion to the French was about as five to six, but after that battle it was little more than one to two: previously we had a hundred thousand against a hundred and twenty thousand; afterwards little more than fifty thousand against a hundred thousand. Yet the shrewd and experienced Kut\u00fazov accepted the battle, while Napoleon, who was said to be a commander of genius, gave it, losing a quarter of his army and lengthening his lines of communication still more. If it is said that he expected to end the campaign by occupying Moscow as he had ended a previous campaign by occupying Vienna, there is much evidence to the contrary. Napoleon\u2019s historians themselves tell us that from Smol\u00e9nsk onwards he wished to stop, knew the danger of his extended position, and knew that the occupation of Moscow would not be the end of the campaign, for he had seen at Smol\u00e9nsk the state in which Russian towns were left to him, and had not received a single reply to his repeated announcements of his wish to negotiate.\n\nIn giving and accepting battle at Borodin\u00f3, Kut\u00fazov acted involuntarily and irrationally. But later on, to fit what had occurred, the historians provided cunningly devised evidence of the foresight and genius of the generals who, of all the blind tools of history were the most enslaved and involuntary.\n\nThe ancients have left us model heroic poems in which the heroes furnish the whole interest of the story, and we are still unable to accustom ourselves to the fact that for our epoch histories of that kind are meaningless.\n\nOn the other question, how the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and the preceding battle of Shev\u00e1rdino were fought, there also exists a definite and well-known, but quite false, conception. All the historians describe the affair as follows:\n\nThe Russian army, they say, in its retreat from Smol\u00e9nsk sought out for itself the best position for a general engagement and found such a position at Borodin\u00f3.\n\nThe Russians, they say, fortified this position in advance on the left of the highroad (from Moscow to Smol\u00e9nsk) and almost at a right angle to it, from Borodin\u00f3 to Ut\u00edtsa, at the very place where the battle was fought.\n\nIn front of this position, they say, a fortified outpost was set up on the Shev\u00e1rdino mound to observe the enemy. On the twenty-fourth, we are told, Napoleon attacked this advanced post and took it, and, on the twenty-sixth, attacked the whole Russian army, which was in position on the field of Borodin\u00f3.\n\nSo the histories say, and it is all quite wrong, as anyone who cares to look into the matter can easily convince himself.\n\nThe Russians did not seek out the best position but, on the contrary, during the retreat passed many positions better than Borodin\u00f3. They did not stop at any one of these positions because Kut\u00fazov did not wish to occupy a position he had not himself chosen, because the popular demand for a battle had not yet expressed itself strongly enough, and because Milor\u00e1dovich had not yet arrived with the militia, and for many other reasons. The fact is that other positions they had passed were stronger, and that the position at Borodin\u00f3 (the one where the battle was fought), far from being strong, was no more a position than any other spot one might find in the Russian Empire by sticking a pin into the map at hazard.\n\nNot only did the Russians not fortify the position on the field of Borodin\u00f3 to the left of, and at a right angle to, the highroad (that is, the position on which the battle took place), but never till the twenty-fifth of August, 1812, did they think that a battle might be fought there. This was shown first by the fact that there were no entrenchments there by the twenty fifth and that those begun on the twenty-fifth and twenty-sixth were not completed, and secondly, by the position of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt. That redoubt was quite senseless in front of the position where the battle was accepted. Why was it more strongly fortified than any other post? And why were all efforts exhausted and six thousand men sacrificed to defend it till late at night on the twenty-fourth? A Cossack patrol would have sufficed to observe the enemy. Thirdly, as proof that the position on which the battle was fought had not been foreseen and that the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt was not an advanced post of that position, we have the fact that up to the twenty-fifth, Barclay de Tolly and Bagrati\u00f3n were convinced that the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt was the left flank of the position, and that Kut\u00fazov himself in his report, written in hot haste after the battle, speaks of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt as the left flank of the position. It was much later, when reports on the battle of Borodin\u00f3 were written at leisure, that the incorrect and extraordinary statement was invented (probably to justify the mistakes of a commander in chief who had to be represented as infallible) that the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt was an advanced post\u2014whereas in reality it was simply a fortified point on the left flank\u2014and that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was fought by us on an entrenched position previously selected, whereas it was fought on a quite unexpected spot which was almost unentrenched.\n\nThe case was evidently this: a position was selected along the river Koloch\u00e1\u2014which crosses the highroad not at a right angle but at an acute angle\u2014so that the left flank was at Shev\u00e1rdino, the right flank near the village of N\u00f3voe, and the center at Borodin\u00f3 at the confluence of the rivers Koloch\u00e1 and V\u00f3yna.\n\nTo anyone who looks at the field of Borodin\u00f3 without thinking of how the battle was actually fought, this position, protected by the river Koloch\u00e1, presents itself as obvious for an army whose object was to prevent an enemy from advancing along the Smol\u00e9nsk road to Moscow.\n\nNapoleon, riding to Val\u00faevo on the twenty-fourth, did not see (as the history books say he did) the position of the Russians from Ut\u00edtsa to Borodin\u00f3 (he could not have seen that position because it did not exist), nor did he see an advanced post of the Russian army, but while pursuing the Russian rearguard he came upon the left flank of the Russian position\u2014at the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt\u2014and unexpectedly for the Russians moved his army across the Koloch\u00e1. And the Russians, not having time to begin a general engagement, withdrew their left wing from the position they had intended to occupy and took up a new position which had not been foreseen and was not fortified. By crossing to the other side of the Koloch\u00e1 to the left of the highroad, Napoleon shifted the whole forthcoming battle from right to left (looking from the Russian side) and transferred it to the plain between Ut\u00edtsa, Sem\u00ebnovsk, and Borodin\u00f3\u2014a plain no more advantageous as a position than any other plain in Russia\u2014and there the whole battle of the twenty-sixth of August took place.\n\nHad Napoleon not ridden out on the evening of the twenty-fourth to the Koloch\u00e1, and had he not then ordered an immediate attack on the redoubt but had begun the attack next morning, no one would have doubted that the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt was the left flank of our position, and the battle would have taken place where we expected it. In that case we should probably have defended the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt\u2014our left flank\u2014still more obstinately. We should have attacked Napoleon in the center or on the right, and the engagement would have taken place on the twenty-fifth, in the position we intended and had fortified. But as the attack on our left flank took place in the evening after the retreat of our rear guard (that is, immediately after the fight at Gridn\u00ebva), and as the Russian commanders did not wish, or were not in time, to begin a general engagement then on the evening of the twenty-fourth, the first and chief action of the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was already lost on the twenty-fourth, and obviously led to the loss of the one fought on the twenty-sixth.\n\nAfter the loss of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt, we found ourselves on the morning of the twenty-fifth without a position for our left flank, and were forced to bend it back and hastily entrench it where it chanced to be.\n\nNot only was the Russian army on the twenty-sixth defended by weak, unfinished entrenchments, but the disadvantage of that position was increased by the fact that the Russian commanders\u2014not having fully realized what had happened, namely the loss of our position on the left flank and the shifting of the whole field of the forthcoming battle from right to left\u2014maintained their extended position from the village of N\u00f3voe to Ut\u00edtsa, and consequently had to move their forces from right to left during the battle. So it happened that throughout the whole battle the Russians opposed the entire French army launched against our left flank with but half as many men. (Poniatowski\u2019s action against Ut\u00edtsa, and Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s on the right flank against the French, were actions distinct from the main course of the battle.) So the battle of Borodin\u00f3 did not take place at all as (in an effort to conceal our commanders\u2019 mistakes even at the cost of diminishing the glory due to the Russian army and people) it has been described. The battle of Borodin\u00f3 was not fought on a chosen and entrenched position with forces only slightly weaker than those of the enemy, but, as a result of the loss of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt, the Russians fought the battle of Borodin\u00f3 on an open and almost unentrenched position, with forces only half as numerous as the French; that is to say, under conditions in which it was not merely unthinkable to fight for ten hours and secure an indecisive result, but unthinkable to keep an army even from complete disintegration and flight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nOn the morning of the twenty-fifth Pierre was leaving Mozh\u00e1ysk. At the descent of the high steep hill, down which a winding road led out of the town past the cathedral on the right, where a service was being held and the bells were ringing, Pierre got out of his vehicle and proceeded on foot. Behind him a cavalry regiment was coming down the hill preceded by its singers. Coming up toward him was a train of carts carrying men who had been wounded in the engagement the day before. The peasant drivers, shouting and lashing their horses, kept crossing from side to side. The carts, in each of which three or four wounded soldiers were lying or sitting, jolted over the stones that had been thrown on the steep incline to make it something like a road. The wounded, bandaged with rags, with pale cheeks, compressed lips, and knitted brows, held on to the sides of the carts as they were jolted against one another. Almost all of them stared with na\u00efve, childlike curiosity at Pierre\u2019s white hat and green swallow-tail coat.\n\nPierre\u2019s coachman shouted angrily at the convoy of wounded to keep to one side of the road. The cavalry regiment, as it descended the hill with its singers, surrounded Pierre\u2019s carriage and blocked the road. Pierre stopped, being pressed against the side of the cutting in which the road ran. The sunshine from behind the hill did not penetrate into the cutting and there it was cold and damp, but above Pierre\u2019s head was the bright August sunshine and the bells sounded merrily. One of the carts with wounded stopped by the side of the road close to Pierre. The driver in his bast shoes ran panting up to it, placed a stone under one of its tireless hind wheels, and began arranging the breech-band on his little horse.\n\nOne of the wounded, an old soldier with a bandaged arm who was following the cart on foot, caught hold of it with his sound hand and turned to look at Pierre.\n\n\u201cI say, fellow countryman! Will they set us down here or take us on to Moscow?\u201d he asked.\n\nPierre was so deep in thought that he did not hear the question. He was looking now at the cavalry regiment that had met the convoy of wounded, now at the cart by which he was standing, in which two wounded men were sitting and one was lying. One of those sitting up in the cart had probably been wounded in the cheek. His whole head was wrapped in rags and one cheek was swollen to the size of a baby\u2019s head. His nose and mouth were twisted to one side. This soldier was looking at the cathedral and crossing himself. Another, a young lad, a fair-haired recruit as white as though there was no blood in his thin face, looked at Pierre kindly, with a fixed smile. The third lay prone so that his face was not visible. The cavalry singers were passing close by:\n\n\nAh lost, quite lost... is my head so keen,\nLiving in a foreign land...\n\n\nthey sang their soldiers\u2019 dance song.\n\nAs if responding to them but with a different sort of merriment, the metallic sound of the bells reverberated high above and the hot rays of the sun bathed the top of the opposite slope with yet another sort of merriment. But beneath the slope, by the cart with the wounded near the panting little nag where Pierre stood, it was damp, somber, and sad.\n\nThe soldier with the swollen cheek looked angrily at the cavalry singers.\n\n\u201cOh, the coxcombs!\u201d he muttered reproachfully.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the soldiers only, but I\u2019ve seen peasants today, too.... The peasants\u2014even they have to go,\u201d said the soldier behind the cart, addressing Pierre with a sad smile. \u201cNo distinctions made nowadays.... They want the whole nation to fall on them\u2014in a word, it\u2019s Moscow! They want to make an end of it.\u201d\n\nIn spite of the obscurity of the soldier\u2019s words Pierre understood what he wanted to say and nodded approval.\n\nThe road was clear again; Pierre descended the hill and drove on.\n\nHe kept looking to either side of the road for familiar faces, but only saw everywhere the unfamiliar faces of various military men of different branches of the service, who all looked with astonishment at his white hat and green tail coat.\n\nHaving gone nearly three miles he at last met an acquaintance and eagerly addressed him. This was one of the head army doctors. He was driving toward Pierre in a covered gig, sitting beside a young surgeon, and on recognizing Pierre he told the Cossack who occupied the driver\u2019s seat to pull up.\n\n\u201cCount! Your excellency, how come you to be here?\u201d asked the doctor.\n\n\u201cWell, you know, I wanted to see...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, there will be something to see....\u201d\n\nPierre got out and talked to the doctor, explaining his intention of taking part in a battle.\n\nThe doctor advised him to apply direct to Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cWhy should you be God knows where out of sight, during the battle?\u201d he said, exchanging glances with his young companion. \u201cAnyhow his Serene Highness knows you and will receive you graciously. That\u2019s what you must do.\u201d\n\nThe doctor seemed tired and in a hurry.\n\n\u201cYou think so?... Ah, I also wanted to ask you where our position is exactly?\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cThe position?\u201d repeated the doctor. \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my line. Drive past Tat\u00e1rinova, a lot of digging is going on there. Go up the hillock and you\u2019ll see.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan one see from there?... If you would...\u201d\n\nBut the doctor interrupted him and moved toward his gig.\n\n\u201cI would go with you but on my honor I\u2019m up to here\u201d\u2014and he pointed to his throat. \u201cI\u2019m galloping to the commander of the corps. How do matters stand?... You know, Count, there\u2019ll be a battle tomorrow. Out of an army of a hundred thousand we must expect at least twenty thousand wounded, and we haven\u2019t stretchers, or bunks, or dressers, or doctors enough for six thousand. We have ten thousand carts, but we need other things as well\u2014we must manage as best we can!\u201d\n\nThe strange thought that of the thousands of men, young and old, who had stared with merry surprise at his hat (perhaps the very men he had noticed), twenty thousand were inevitably doomed to wounds and death amazed Pierre.\n\n\u201cThey may die tomorrow; why are they thinking of anything but death?\u201d And by some latent sequence of thought the descent of the Mozh\u00e1ysk hill, the carts with the wounded, the ringing bells, the slanting rays of the sun, and the songs of the cavalrymen vividly recurred to his mind.\n\n\u201cThe cavalry ride to battle and meet the wounded and do not for a moment think of what awaits them, but pass by, winking at the wounded. Yet from among these men twenty thousand are doomed to die, and they wonder at my hat! Strange!\u201d thought Pierre, continuing his way to Tat\u00e1rinova.\n\nIn front of a landowner\u2019s house to the left of the road stood carriages, wagons, and crowds of orderlies and sentinels. The commander in chief was putting up there, but just when Pierre arrived he was not in and hardly any of the staff were there\u2014they had gone to the church service. Pierre drove on toward G\u00f3rki.\n\nWhen he had ascended the hill and reached the little village street, he saw for the first time peasant militiamen in their white shirts and with crosses on their caps, who, talking and laughing loudly, animated and perspiring, were at work on a huge knoll overgrown with grass to the right of the road.\n\nSome of them were digging, others were wheeling barrowloads of earth along planks, while others stood about doing nothing.\n\nTwo officers were standing on the knoll, directing the men. On seeing these peasants, who were evidently still amused by the novelty of their position as soldiers, Pierre once more thought of the wounded men at Mozh\u00e1ysk and understood what the soldier had meant when he said: \u201cThey want the whole nation to fall on them.\u201d The sight of these bearded peasants at work on the battlefield, with their queer, clumsy boots and perspiring necks, and their shirts opening from the left toward the middle, unfastened, exposing their sunburned collarbones, impressed Pierre more strongly with the solemnity and importance of the moment than anything he had yet seen or heard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nPierre stepped out of his carriage and, passing the toiling militiamen, ascended the knoll from which, according to the doctor, the battlefield could be seen.\n\nIt was about eleven o\u2019clock. The sun shone somewhat to the left and behind him and brightly lit up the enormous panorama which, rising like an amphitheater, extended before him in the clear rarefied atmosphere.\n\nFrom above on the left, bisecting that amphitheater, wound the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad, passing through a village with a white church some five hundred paces in front of the knoll and below it. This was Borodin\u00f3. Below the village the road crossed the river by a bridge and, winding down and up, rose higher and higher to the village of Val\u00faevo visible about four miles away, where Napoleon was then stationed. Beyond Val\u00faevo the road disappeared into a yellowing forest on the horizon. Far in the distance in that birch and fir forest to the right of the road, the cross and belfry of the Koloch\u00e1 Monastery gleamed in the sun. Here and there over the whole of that blue expanse, to right and left of the forest and the road, smoking campfires could be seen and indefinite masses of troops\u2014ours and the enemy\u2019s. The ground to the right\u2014along the course of the Koloch\u00e1 and Moskv\u00e1 rivers\u2014was broken and hilly. Between the hollows the villages of Bez\u00fabova and Zakh\u00e1rino showed in the distance. On the left the ground was more level; there were fields of grain, and the smoking ruins of Sem\u00ebnovsk, which had been burned down, could be seen.\n\nAll that Pierre saw was so indefinite that neither the left nor the right side of the field fully satisfied his expectations. Nowhere could he see the battlefield he had expected to find, but only fields, meadows, troops, woods, the smoke of campfires, villages, mounds, and streams; and try as he would he could descry no military \u201cposition\u201d in this place which teemed with life, nor could he even distinguish our troops from the enemy\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI must ask someone who knows,\u201d he thought, and addressed an officer who was looking with curiosity at his huge unmilitary figure.\n\n\u201cMay I ask you,\u201d said Pierre, \u201cwhat village that is in front?\u201d\n\n\u201cB\u00fardino, isn\u2019t it?\u201d said the officer, turning to his companion.\n\n\u201cBorodin\u00f3,\u201d the other corrected him.\n\nThe officer, evidently glad of an opportunity for a talk, moved up to Pierre.\n\n\u201cAre those our men there?\u201d Pierre inquired.\n\n\u201cYes, and there, further on, are the French,\u201d said the officer. \u201cThere they are, there... you can see them.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere? Where?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cOne can see them with the naked eye... Why, there!\u201d\n\nThe officer pointed with his hand to the smoke visible on the left beyond the river, and the same stern and serious expression that Pierre had noticed on many of the faces he had met came into his face.\n\n\u201cAh, those are the French! And over there?...\u201d Pierre pointed to a knoll on the left, near which some troops could be seen.\n\n\u201cThose are ours.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, ours! And there?...\u201d Pierre pointed to another knoll in the distance with a big tree on it, near a village that lay in a hollow where also some campfires were smoking and something black was visible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s his again,\u201d said the officer. (It was the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt.) \u201cIt was ours yesterday, but now it is his.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen how about our position?\u201d\n\n\u201cOur position?\u201d replied the officer with a smile of satisfaction. \u201cI can tell you quite clearly, because I constructed nearly all our entrenchments. There, you see? There\u2019s our center, at Borodin\u00f3, just there,\u201d and he pointed to the village in front of them with the white church. \u201cThat\u2019s where one crosses the Koloch\u00e1. You see down there where the rows of hay are lying in the hollow, there\u2019s the bridge. That\u2019s our center. Our right flank is over there\u201d\u2014he pointed sharply to the right, far away in the broken ground\u2014\u201cThat\u2019s where the Moskv\u00e1 River is, and we have thrown up three redoubts there, very strong ones. The left flank...\u201d here the officer paused. \u201cWell, you see, that\u2019s difficult to explain.... Yesterday our left flank was there at Shev\u00e1rdino, you see, where the oak is, but now we have withdrawn our left wing\u2014now it is over there, do you see that village and the smoke? That\u2019s Sem\u00ebnovsk, yes, there,\u201d he pointed to Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s knoll. \u201cBut the battle will hardly be there. His having moved his troops there is only a ruse; he will probably pass round to the right of the Moskv\u00e1. But wherever it may be, many a man will be missing tomorrow!\u201d he remarked.\n\nAn elderly sergeant who had approached the officer while he was giving these explanations had waited in silence for him to finish speaking, but at this point, evidently not liking the officer\u2019s remark, interrupted him.\n\n\u201cGabions must be sent for,\u201d said he sternly.\n\nThe officer appeared abashed, as though he understood that one might think of how many men would be missing tomorrow but ought not to speak of it.\n\n\u201cWell, send number three company again,\u201d the officer replied hurriedly.\n\n\u201cAnd you, are you one of the doctors?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ve come on my own,\u201d answered Pierre, and he went down the hill again, passing the militiamen.\n\n\u201cOh, those damned fellows!\u201d muttered the officer who followed him, holding his nose as he ran past the men at work.\n\n\u201cThere they are... bringing her, coming... There they are... They\u2019ll be here in a minute...\u201d voices were suddenly heard saying; and officers, soldiers, and militiamen began running forward along the road.\n\nA church procession was coming up the hill from Borodin\u00f3. First along the dusty road came the infantry in ranks, bareheaded and with arms reversed. From behind them came the sound of church singing.\n\nSoldiers and militiamen ran bareheaded past Pierre toward the procession.\n\n\u201cThey are bringing her, our Protectress!... The Iberian Mother of God!\u201d someone ", "sequence": 19}, {"offset": 2000000, "text": "cried.\n\n\u201cThe Smol\u00e9nsk Mother of God,\u201d another corrected him.\n\nThe militiamen, both those who had been in the village and those who had been at work on the battery, threw down their spades and ran to meet the church procession. Following the battalion that marched along the dusty road came priests in their vestments\u2014one little old man in a hood with attendants and singers. Behind them soldiers and officers bore a large, dark-faced icon with an embossed metal cover. This was the icon that had been brought from Smol\u00e9nsk and had since accompanied the army. Behind, before, and on both sides, crowds of militiamen with bared heads walked, ran, and bowed to the ground.\n\nAt the summit of the hill they stopped with the icon; the men who had been holding it up by the linen bands attached to it were relieved by others, the chanters relit their censers, and service began. The hot rays of the sun beat down vertically and a fresh soft wind played with the hair of the bared heads and with the ribbons decorating the icon. The singing did not sound loud under the open sky. An immense crowd of bareheaded officers, soldiers, and militiamen surrounded the icon. Behind the priest and a chanter stood the notabilities on a spot reserved for them. A bald general with a St. George\u2019s Cross on his neck stood just behind the priest\u2019s back, and without crossing himself (he was evidently a German) patiently awaited the end of the service, which he considered it necessary to hear to the end, probably to arouse the patriotism of the Russian people. Another general stood in a martial pose, crossing himself by shaking his hand in front of his chest while looking about him. Standing among the crowd of peasants, Pierre recognized several acquaintances among these notables, but did not look at them\u2014his whole attention was absorbed in watching the serious expression on the faces of the crowd of soldiers and militiamen who were all gazing eagerly at the icon. As soon as the tired chanters, who were singing the service for the twentieth time that day, began lazily and mechanically to sing: \u201cSave from calamity Thy servants, O Mother of God,\u201d and the priest and deacon chimed in: \u201cFor to Thee under God we all flee as to an inviolable bulwark and protection,\u201d there again kindled in all those faces the same expression of consciousness of the solemnity of the impending moment that Pierre had seen on the faces at the foot of the hill at Mozh\u00e1ysk and momentarily on many and many faces he had met that morning; and heads were bowed more frequently and hair tossed back, and sighs and the sound men made as they crossed themselves were heard.\n\nThe crowd round the icon suddenly parted and pressed against Pierre. Someone, a very important personage judging by the haste with which way was made for him, was approaching the icon.\n\nIt was Kut\u00fazov, who had been riding round the position and on his way back to Tat\u00e1rinova had stopped where the service was being held. Pierre recognized him at once by his peculiar figure, which distinguished him from everybody else.\n\nWith a long overcoat on his exceedingly stout, round-shouldered body, with uncovered white head and puffy face showing the white ball of the eye he had lost, Kut\u00fazov walked with plunging, swaying gait into the crowd and stopped behind the priest. He crossed himself with an accustomed movement, bent till he touched the ground with his hand, and bowed his white head with a deep sigh. Behind Kut\u00fazov was Bennigsen and the suite. Despite the presence of the commander in chief, who attracted the attention of all the superior officers, the militiamen and soldiers continued their prayers without looking at him.\n\nWhen the service was over, Kut\u00fazov stepped up to the icon, sank heavily to his knees, bowed to the ground, and for a long time tried vainly to rise, but could not do so on account of his weakness and weight. His white head twitched with the effort. At last he rose, kissed the icon as a child does with na\u00efvely pouting lips, and again bowed till he touched the ground with his hand. The other generals followed his example, then the officers, and after them with excited faces, pressing on one another, crowding, panting, and pushing, scrambled the soldiers and militiamen.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nStaggering amid the crush, Pierre looked about him.\n\n\u201cCount Peter Kir\u00edlovich! How did you get here?\u201d said a voice.\n\nPierre looked round. Bor\u00eds Drubetsk\u00f3y, brushing his knees with his hand (he had probably soiled them when he, too, had knelt before the icon), came up to him smiling. Bor\u00eds was elegantly dressed, with a slightly martial touch appropriate to a campaign. He wore a long coat and like Kut\u00fazov had a whip slung across his shoulder.\n\nMeanwhile Kut\u00fazov had reached the village and seated himself in the shade of the nearest house, on a bench which one Cossack had run to fetch and another had hastily covered with a rug. An immense and brilliant suite surrounded him.\n\nThe icon was carried further, accompanied by the throng. Pierre stopped some thirty paces from Kut\u00fazov, talking to Bor\u00eds.\n\nHe explained his wish to be present at the battle and to see the position.\n\n\u201cThis is what you must do,\u201d said Bor\u00eds. \u201cI will do the honors of the camp to you. You will see everything best from where Count Bennigsen will be. I am in attendance on him, you know; I\u2019ll mention it to him. But if you want to ride round the position, come along with us. We are just going to the left flank. Then when we get back, do spend the night with me and we\u2019ll arrange a game of cards. Of course you know Dm\u00edtri Serg\u00e9evich? Those are his quarters,\u201d and he pointed to the third house in the village of G\u00f3rki.\n\n\u201cBut I should like to see the right flank. They say it\u2019s very strong,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cI should like to start from the Moskv\u00e1 River and ride round the whole position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you can do that later, but the chief thing is the left flank.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes. But where is Prince Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s regiment? Can you point it out to me?\u201d\n\n\u201cPrince Andrew\u2019s? We shall pass it and I\u2019ll take you to him.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat about the left flank?\u201d asked Pierre\n\n\u201cTo tell you the truth, between ourselves, God only knows what state our left flank is in,\u201d said Bor\u00eds confidentially lowering his voice. \u201cIt is not at all what Count Bennigsen intended. He meant to fortify that knoll quite differently, but...\u201d Bor\u00eds shrugged his shoulders, \u201chis Serene Highness would not have it, or someone persuaded him. You see...\u201d but Bor\u00eds did not finish, for at that moment Kays\u00e1rov, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s adjutant, came up to Pierre. \u201cAh, Kays\u00e1rov!\u201d said Bor\u00eds, addressing him with an unembarrassed smile, \u201cI was just trying to explain our position to the count. It is amazing how his Serene Highness could so foresee the intentions of the French!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou mean the left flank?\u201d asked Kays\u00e1rov.\n\n\u201cYes, exactly; the left flank is now extremely strong.\u201d\n\nThough Kut\u00fazov had dismissed all unnecessary men from the staff, Bor\u00eds had contrived to remain at headquarters after the changes. He had established himself with Count Bennigsen, who, like all on whom Bor\u00eds had been in attendance, considered young Prince Drubetsk\u00f3y an invaluable man.\n\nIn the higher command there were two sharply defined parties: Kut\u00fazov\u2019s party and that of Bennigsen, the chief of staff. Bor\u00eds belonged to the latter and no one else, while showing servile respect to Kut\u00fazov, could so create an impression that the old fellow was not much good and that Bennigsen managed everything. Now the decisive moment of battle had come when Kut\u00fazov would be destroyed and the power pass to Bennigsen, or even if Kut\u00fazov won the battle it would be felt that everything was done by Bennigsen. In any case many great rewards would have to be given for tomorrow\u2019s action, and new men would come to the front. So Bor\u00eds was full of nervous vivacity all day.\n\nAfter Kays\u00e1rov, others whom Pierre knew came up to him, and he had not time to reply to all the questions about Moscow that were showered upon him, or to listen to all that was told him. The faces all expressed animation and apprehension, but it seemed to Pierre that the cause of the excitement shown in some of these faces lay chiefly in questions of personal success; his mind, however, was occupied by the different expression he saw on other faces\u2014an expression that spoke not of personal matters but of the universal questions of life and death. Kut\u00fazov noticed Pierre\u2019s figure and the group gathered round him.\n\n\u201cCall him to me,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov.\n\nAn adjutant told Pierre of his Serene Highness\u2019 wish, and Pierre went toward Kut\u00fazov\u2019s bench. But a militiaman got there before him. It was D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cHow did that fellow get here?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a creature that wriggles in anywhere!\u201d was the answer. \u201cHe has been degraded, you know. Now he wants to bob up again. He\u2019s been proposing some scheme or other and has crawled into the enemy\u2019s picket line at night.... He\u2019s a brave fellow.\u201d\n\nPierre took off his hat and bowed respectfully to Kut\u00fazov.\n\n\u201cI concluded that if I reported to your Serene Highness you might send me away or say that you knew what I was reporting, but then I shouldn\u2019t lose anything...\u201d D\u00f3lokhov was saying.\n\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut if I were right, I should be rendering a service to my Fatherland for which I am ready to die.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd should your Serene Highness require a man who will not spare his skin, please think of me.... Perhaps I may prove useful to your Serene Highness.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes... Yes...\u201d Kut\u00fazov repeated, his laughing eye narrowing more and more as he looked at Pierre.\n\nJust then Bor\u00eds, with his courtierlike adroitness, stepped up to Pierre\u2019s side near Kut\u00fazov and in a most natural manner, without raising his voice, said to Pierre, as though continuing an interrupted conversation:\n\n\u201cThe militia have put on clean white shirts to be ready to die. What heroism, Count!\u201d\n\nBor\u00eds evidently said this to Pierre in order to be overheard by his Serene Highness. He knew Kut\u00fazov\u2019s attention would be caught by those words, and so it was.\n\n\u201cWhat are you saying about the militia?\u201d he asked Bor\u00eds.\n\n\u201cPreparing for tomorrow, your Serene Highness\u2014for death\u2014they have put on clean shirts.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh... a wonderful, a matchless people!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov; and he closed his eyes and swayed his head. \u201cA matchless people!\u201d he repeated with a sigh.\n\n\u201cSo you want to smell gunpowder?\u201d he said to Pierre. \u201cYes, it\u2019s a pleasant smell. I have the honor to be one of your wife\u2019s adorers. Is she well? My quarters are at your service.\u201d\n\nAnd as often happens with old people, Kut\u00fazov began looking about absent-mindedly as if forgetting all he wanted to say or do.\n\nThen, evidently remembering what he wanted, he beckoned to Andrew Kays\u00e1rov, his adjutant\u2019s brother.\n\n\u201cThose verses... those verses of M\u00e1rin\u2019s... how do they go, eh? Those he wrote about Ger\u00e1kov: \u2018Lectures for the corps inditing\u2019... Recite them, recite them!\u201d said he, evidently preparing to laugh.\n\nKays\u00e1rov recited.... Kut\u00fazov smilingly nodded his head to the rhythm of the verses.\n\nWhen Pierre had left Kut\u00fazov, D\u00f3lokhov came up to him and took his hand.\n\n\u201cI am very glad to meet you here, Count,\u201d he said aloud, regardless of the presence of strangers and in a particularly resolute and solemn tone. \u201cOn the eve of a day when God alone knows who of us is fated to survive, I am glad of this opportunity to tell you that I regret the misunderstandings that occurred between us and should wish you not to have any ill feeling for me. I beg you to forgive me.\u201d\n\nPierre looked at D\u00f3lokhov with a smile, not knowing what to say to him. With tears in his eyes D\u00f3lokhov embraced Pierre and kissed him.\n\nBor\u00eds said a few words to his general, and Count Bennigsen turned to Pierre and proposed that he should ride with him along the line.\n\n\u201cIt will interest you,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cYes, very much,\u201d replied Pierre.\n\nHalf an hour later Kut\u00fazov left for Tat\u00e1rinova, and Bennigsen and his suite, with Pierre among them, set out on their ride along the line.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nFrom G\u00f3rki, Bennigsen descended the highroad to the bridge which, when they had looked at it from the hill, the officer had pointed out as being the center of our position and where rows of fragrant new-mown hay lay by the riverside. They rode across that bridge into the village of Borodin\u00f3 and thence turned to the left, passing an enormous number of troops and guns, and came to a high knoll where militiamen were digging. This was the redoubt, as yet unnamed, which afterwards became known as the Ra\u00e9vski Redoubt, or the Knoll Battery, but Pierre paid no special attention to it. He did not know that it would become more memorable to him than any other spot on the plain of Borodin\u00f3.\n\nThey then crossed the hollow to Sem\u00ebnovsk, where the soldiers were dragging away the last logs from the huts and barns. Then they rode downhill and uphill, across a ryefield trodden and beaten down as if by hail, following a track freshly made by the artillery over the furrows of the plowed land, and reached some fl\u00e8ches which were still being dug.\n\nAt the fl\u00e8ches Bennigsen stopped and began looking at the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt opposite, which had been ours the day before and where several horsemen could be descried. The officers said that either Napoleon or Murat was there, and they all gazed eagerly at this little group of horsemen. Pierre also looked at them, trying to guess which of the scarcely discernible figures was Napoleon. At last those mounted men rode away from the mound and disappeared.\n\nBennigsen spoke to a general who approached him, and began explaining the whole position of our troops. Pierre listened to him, straining each faculty to understand the essential points of the impending battle, but was mortified to feel that his mental capacity was inadequate for the task. He could make nothing of it. Bennigsen stopped speaking and, noticing that Pierre was listening, suddenly said to him:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think this interests you?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary it\u2019s very interesting!\u201d replied Pierre not quite truthfully.\n\nFrom the fl\u00e8ches they rode still farther to the left, along a road winding through a thick, low-growing birch wood. In the middle of the wood a brown hare with white feet sprang out and, scared by the tramp of the many horses, grew so confused that it leaped along the road in front of them for some time, arousing general attention and laughter, and only when several voices shouted at it did it dart to one side and disappear in the thicket. After going through the wood for about a mile and a half they came out on a glade where troops of T\u00fachkov\u2019s corps were stationed to defend the left flank.\n\nHere, at the extreme left flank, Bennigsen talked a great deal and with much heat, and, as it seemed to Pierre, gave orders of great military importance. In front of T\u00fachkov\u2019s troops was some high ground not occupied by troops. Bennigsen loudly criticized this mistake, saying that it was madness to leave a height which commanded the country around unoccupied and to place troops below it. Some of the generals expressed the same opinion. One in particular declared with martial heat that they were put there to be slaughtered. Bennigsen on his own authority ordered the troops to occupy the high ground. This disposition on the left flank increased Pierre\u2019s doubt of his own capacity to understand military matters. Listening to Bennigsen and the generals criticizing the position of the troops behind the hill, he quite understood them and shared their opinion, but for that very reason he could not understand how the man who put them there behind the hill could have made so gross and palpable a blunder.\n\nPierre did not know that these troops were not, as Bennigsen supposed, put there to defend the position, but were in a concealed position as an ambush, that they should not be seen and might be able to strike an approaching enemy unexpectedly. Bennigsen did not know this and moved the troops forward according to his own ideas without mentioning the matter to the commander in chief.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOn that bright evening of August 25, Prince Andrew lay leaning on his elbow in a broken-down shed in the village of Knyazk\u00f3vo at the further end of his regiment\u2019s encampment. Through a gap in the broken wall he could see, beside the wooden fence, a row of thirty-year-old birches with their lower branches lopped off, a field on which shocks of oats were standing, and some bushes near which rose the smoke of campfires\u2014the soldiers\u2019 kitchens.\n\nNarrow and burdensome and useless to anyone as his life now seemed to him, Prince Andrew on the eve of battle felt agitated and irritable as he had done seven years before at Austerlitz.\n\nHe had received and given the orders for next day\u2019s battle and had nothing more to do. But his thoughts\u2014the simplest, clearest, and therefore most terrible thoughts\u2014would give him no peace. He knew that tomorrow\u2019s battle would be the most terrible of all he had taken part in, and for the first time in his life the possibility of death presented itself to him\u2014not in relation to any worldly matter or with reference to its effect on others, but simply in relation to himself, to his own soul\u2014vividly, plainly, terribly, and almost as a certainty. And from the height of this perception all that had previously tormented and preoccupied him suddenly became illumined by a cold white light without shadows, without perspective, without distinction of outline. All life appeared to him like magic-lantern pictures at which he had long been gazing by artificial light through a glass. Now he suddenly saw those badly daubed pictures in clear daylight and without a glass. \u201cYes, yes! There they are, those false images that agitated, enraptured, and tormented me,\u201d said he to himself, passing in review the principal pictures of the magic lantern of life and regarding them now in the cold white daylight of his clear perception of death. \u201cThere they are, those rudely painted figures that once seemed splendid and mysterious. Glory, the good of society, love of a woman, the Fatherland itself\u2014how important these pictures appeared to me, with what profound meaning they seemed to be filled! And it is all so simple, pale, and crude in the cold white light of this morning which I feel is dawning for me.\u201d The three great sorrows of his life held his attention in particular: his love for a woman, his father\u2019s death, and the French invasion which had overrun half Russia. \u201cLove... that little girl who seemed to me brimming over with mystic forces! Yes, indeed, I loved her. I made romantic plans of love and happiness with her! Oh, what a boy I was!\u201d he said aloud bitterly. \u201cAh me! I believed in some ideal love which was to keep her faithful to me for the whole year of my absence! Like the gentle dove in the fable she was to pine apart from me.... But it was much simpler really.... It was all very simple and horrible.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my father built Bald Hills he thought the place was his: his land, his air, his peasants. But Napoleon came and swept him aside, unconscious of his existence, as he might brush a chip from his path, and his Bald Hills and his whole life fell to pieces. Princess Mary says it is a trial sent from above. What is the trial for, when he is not here and will never return? He is not here! For whom then is the trial intended? The Fatherland, the destruction of Moscow! And tomorrow I shall be killed, perhaps not even by a Frenchman but by one of our own men, by a soldier discharging a musket close to my ear as one of them did yesterday, and the French will come and take me by head and heels and fling me into a hole that I may not stink under their noses, and new conditions of life will arise, which will seem quite ordinary to others and about which I shall know nothing. I shall not exist....\u201d\n\nHe looked at the row of birches shining in the sunshine, with their motionless green and yellow foliage and white bark. \u201cTo die... to be killed tomorrow... That I should not exist... That all this should still be, but no me....\u201d\n\nAnd the birches with their light and shade, the curly clouds, the smoke of the campfires, and all that was around him changed and seemed terrible and menacing. A cold shiver ran down his spine. He rose quickly, went out of the shed, and began to walk about.\n\nAfter he had returned, voices were heard outside the shed. \u201cWho\u2019s that?\u201d he cried.\n\nThe red-nosed Captain Tim\u00f3khin, formerly D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s squadron commander, but now from lack of officers a battalion commander, shyly entered the shed followed by an adjutant and the regimental paymaster.\n\nPrince Andrew rose hastily, listened to the business they had come about, gave them some further instructions, and was about to dismiss them when he heard a familiar, lisping, voice behind the shed.\n\n\u201cDevil take it!\u201d said the voice of a man stumbling over something.\n\nPrince Andrew looked out of the shed and saw Pierre, who had tripped over a pole on the ground and had nearly fallen, coming his way. It was unpleasant to Prince Andrew to meet people of his own set in general, and Pierre especially, for he reminded him of all the painful moments of his last visit to Moscow.\n\n\u201cYou? What a surprise!\u201d said he. \u201cWhat brings you here? This is unexpected!\u201d\n\nAs he said this his eyes and face expressed more than coldness\u2014they expressed hostility, which Pierre noticed at once. He had approached the shed full of animation, but on seeing Prince Andrew\u2019s face he felt constrained and ill at ease.\n\n\u201cI have come... simply... you know... come... it interests me,\u201d said Pierre, who had so often that day senselessly repeated that word \u201cinteresting.\u201d \u201cI wish to see the battle.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, and what do the Masonic brothers say about war? How would they stop it?\u201d said Prince Andrew sarcastically. \u201cWell, and how\u2019s Moscow? And my people? Have they reached Moscow at last?\u201d he asked seriously.\n\n\u201cYes, they have. Julie Drubetsk\u00e1ya told me so. I went to see them, but missed them. They have gone to your estate near Moscow.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nThe officers were about to take leave, but Prince Andrew, apparently reluctant to be left alone with his friend, asked them to stay and have tea. Seats were brought in and so was the tea. The officers gazed with surprise at Pierre\u2019s huge stout figure and listened to his talk of Moscow and the position of our army, round which he had ridden. Prince Andrew remained silent, and his expression was so forbidding that Pierre addressed his remarks chiefly to the good-natured battalion commander.\n\n\u201cSo you understand the whole position of our troops?\u201d Prince Andrew interrupted him.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014that is, how do you mean?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cNot being a military man I can\u2019t say I have understood it fully, but I understand the general position.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you know more than anyone else, be it who it may,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cOh!\u201d said Pierre, looking over his spectacles in perplexity at Prince Andrew. \u201cWell, and what do you think of Kut\u00fazov\u2019s appointment?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI was very glad of his appointment, that\u2019s all I know,\u201d replied Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cAnd tell me your opinion of Barclay de Tolly. In Moscow they are saying heaven knows what about him.... What do you think of him?\u201d\n\n\u201cAsk them,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, indicating the officers.\n\nPierre looked at Tim\u00f3khin with the condescendingly interrogative smile with which everybody involuntarily addressed that officer.\n\n\u201cWe see light again, since his Serenity has been appointed, your excellency,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin timidly, and continually turning to glance at his colonel.\n\n\u201cWhy so?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cWell, to mention only firewood and fodder, let me inform you. Why, when we were retreating from Sventsy\u00e1ni we dare not touch a stick or a wisp of hay or anything. You see, we were going away, so he would get it all; wasn\u2019t it so, your excellency?\u201d and again Tim\u00f3khin turned to the prince. \u201cBut we daren\u2019t. In our regiment two officers were court-martialed for that kind of thing. But when his Serenity took command everything became straightforward. Now we see light....\u201d\n\n\u201cThen why was it forbidden?\u201d\n\nTim\u00f3khin looked about in confusion, not knowing what or how to answer such a question. Pierre put the same question to Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cWhy, so as not to lay waste the country we were abandoning to the enemy,\u201d said Prince Andrew with venomous irony. \u201cIt is very sound: one can\u2019t permit the land to be pillaged and accustom the troops to marauding. At Smol\u00e9nsk too he judged correctly that the French might outflank us, as they had larger forces. But he could not understand this,\u201d cried Prince Andrew in a shrill voice that seemed to escape him involuntarily: \u201che could not understand that there, for the first time, we were fighting for Russian soil, and that there was a spirit in the men such as I had never seen before, that we had held the French for two days, and that that success had increased our strength tenfold. He ordered us to retreat, and all our efforts and losses went for nothing. He had no thought of betraying us, he tried to do the best he could, he thought out everything, and that is why he is unsuitable. He is unsuitable now, just because he plans out everything very thoroughly and accurately as every German has to. How can I explain?... Well, say your father has a German valet, and he is a splendid valet and satisfies your father\u2019s requirements better than you could, then it\u2019s all right to let him serve. But if your father is mortally sick you\u2019ll send the valet away and attend to your father with your own unpracticed, awkward hands, and will soothe him better than a skilled man who is a stranger could. So it has been with Barclay. While Russia was well, a foreigner could serve her and be a splendid minister; but as soon as she is in danger she needs one of her own kin. But in your Club they have been making him out a traitor! They slander him as a traitor, and the only result will be that afterwards, ashamed of their false accusations, they will make him out a hero or a genius instead of a traitor, and that will be still more unjust. He is an honest and very punctilious German.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they say he\u2019s a skillful commander,\u201d rejoined Pierre.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand what is meant by \u2018a skillful commander,\u2019\u201d replied Prince Andrew ironically.\n\n\u201cA skillful commander?\u201d replied Pierre. \u201cWhy, one who foresees all contingencies... and foresees the adversary\u2019s intentions.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Prince Andrew as if it were a matter settled long ago.\n\nPierre looked at him in surprise.\n\n\u201cAnd yet they say that war is like a game of chess?\u201d he remarked.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Prince Andrew, \u201cbut with this little difference, that in chess you may think over each move as long as you please and are not limited for time, and with this difference too, that a knight is always stronger than a pawn, and two pawns are always stronger than one, while in war a battalion is sometimes stronger than a division and sometimes weaker than a company. The relative strength of bodies of troops can never be known to anyone. Believe me,\u201d he went on, \u201cif things depended on arrangements made by the staff, I should be there making arrangements, but instead of that I have the honor to serve here in the regiment with these gentlemen, and I consider that on us tomorrow\u2019s battle will depend and not on those others.... Success never depends, and never will depend, on position, or equipment, or even on numbers, and least of all on position.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut on what then?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the feeling that is in me and in him,\u201d he pointed to Tim\u00f3khin, \u201cand in each soldier.\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew glanced at Tim\u00f3khin, who looked at his commander in alarm and bewilderment. In contrast to his former reticent taciturnity Prince Andrew now seemed excited. He could apparently not refrain from expressing the thoughts that had suddenly occurred to him.\n\n\u201cA battle is won by those who firmly resolve to win it! Why did we lose the battle at Austerlitz? The French losses were almost equal to ours, but very early we said to ourselves that we were losing the battle, and we did lose it. And we said so because we had nothing to fight for there, we wanted to get away from the battlefield as soon as we could. \u2018We\u2019ve lost, so let us run,\u2019 and we ran. If we had not said that till the evening, heaven knows what might not have happened. But tomorrow we shan\u2019t say it! You talk about our position, the left flank weak and the right flank too extended,\u201d he went on. \u201cThat\u2019s all nonsense, there\u2019s nothing of the kind. But what awaits us tomorrow? A hundred million most diverse chances which will be decided on the instant by the fact that our men or theirs run or do not run, and that this man or that man is killed, but all that is being done at present is only play. The fact is that those men with whom you have ridden round the position not only do not help matters, but hinder. They are only concerned with their own petty interests.\u201d\n\n\u201cAt such a moment?\u201d said Pierre reproachfully.\n\n\u201cAt such a moment!\u201d Prince Andrew repeated. \u201cTo them it is only a moment affording opportunities to undermine a rival and obtain an extra cross or ribbon. For me tomorrow means this: a Russian army of a hundred thousand and a French army of a hundred thousand have met to fight, and the thing is that these two hundred thousand men will fight and the side that fights more fiercely and spares itself least will win. And if you like I will tell you that whatever happens and whatever muddles those at the top may make, we shall win tomorrow\u2019s battle. Tomorrow, happen what may, we shall win!\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now, your excellency! That\u2019s the truth, the real truth,\u201d said Tim\u00f3khin. \u201cWho would spare himself now? The soldiers in my battalion, believe me, wouldn\u2019t drink their vodka! \u2018It\u2019s not the day for that!\u2019 they say.\u201d\n\nAll were silent. The officers rose. Prince Andrew went out of the shed with them, giving final orders to the adjutant. After they had gone Pierre approached Prince Andrew and was about to start a conversation when they heard the clatter of three horses\u2019 hoofs on the road not far from the shed, and looking in that direction Prince Andrew recognized Wolzogen and Clausewitz accompanied by a Cossack. They rode close by continuing to converse, and Prince Andrew involuntarily heard these words:\n\n\u201cDer Krieg muss in Raum verlegt werden. Der Ansicht kann ich nicht genug Preis geben,\u201d said one of them.\n\n\u201cOh, ja,\u201d said the other, \u201cder Zweck ist nur den Feind zu schw\u00e4chen, so kann man gewiss nicht den Verlust der Privat-Personen in Achtung nehmen.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, no,\u201d agreed the other.\n\n\u201cExtend widely!\u201d said Prince Andrew with an angry snort, when they had ridden past. \u201cIn that \u2018extend\u2019 were my father, son, and sister, at Bald Hills. That\u2019s all the same to him! That\u2019s what I was saying to you\u2014those German gentlemen won\u2019t win the battle tomorrow but will only make all the mess they can, because they have nothing in their German heads but theories not worth an empty eggshell and haven\u2019t in their hearts the one thing needed tomorrow\u2014that which Tim\u00f3khin has. They have yielded up all Europe to him, and have now come to teach us. Fine teachers!\u201d and again his voice grew shrill.\n\n\u201cSo you think we shall win tomorrow\u2019s battle?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d answered Prince Andrew absently. \u201cOne thing I would do if I had the power,\u201d he began again, \u201cI would not take prisoners. Why take prisoners? It\u2019s chivalry! The French have destroyed my home and are on their way to destroy Moscow, they have outraged and are outraging me every moment. They are my enemies. In my opinion they are all criminals. And so thinks Tim\u00f3khin and the whole army. They should be executed! Since they are my foes they cannot be my friends, whatever may have been said at Tilsit.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d muttered Pierre, looking with shining eyes at Prince Andrew. \u201cI quite agree with you!\u201d\n\nThe question that had perturbed Pierre on the Mozh\u00e1ysk hill and all that day now seemed to him quite clear and completely solved. He now understood the whole meaning and importance of this war and of the impending battle. All he had seen that day, all the significant and stern expressions on the faces he had seen in passing, were lit up for him by a new light. He understood that latent heat (as they say in physics) of patriotism which was present in all these men he had seen, and this explained to him why they all prepared for death calmly, and as it were lightheartedly.\n\n\u201cNot take prisoners,\u201d Prince Andrew continued: \u201cThat by itself would quite change the whole war and make it less cruel. As it is we have played at war\u2014that\u2019s what\u2019s vile! We play at magnanimity and all that stuff. Such magnanimity and sensibility are like the magnanimity and sensibility of a lady who faints when she sees a calf being killed: she is so kindhearted that she can\u2019t look at blood, but enjoys eating the calf served up with sauce. They talk to us of the rules of war, of chivalry, of flags of truce, of mercy to the unfortunate and so on. It\u2019s all rubbish! I saw chivalry and flags of truce in 1805; they humbugged us and we humbugged them. They plunder other people\u2019s houses, issue false paper money, and worst of all they kill my children and my father, and then talk of rules of war and magnanimity to foes! Take no prisoners, but kill and be killed! He who has come to this as I have through the same sufferings...\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew, who had thought it was all the same to him whether or not Moscow was taken as Smol\u00e9nsk had been, was suddenly checked in his speech by an unexpected cramp in his throat. He paced up and down a few times in silence, but his eyes glittered feverishly and his lips quivered as he began speaking.\n\n\u201cIf there was none of this magnanimity in war, we should go to war only when it was worth while going to certain death, as now. Then there would not be war because Paul Iv\u00e1novich had offended Michael Iv\u00e1novich. And when there was a war, like this one, it would be war! And then the determination of the troops would be quite different. Then all these Westphalians and Hessians whom Napoleon is leading would not follow him into Russia, and we should not go to fight in Austria and Prussia without knowing why. War is not courtesy but the most horrible thing in life; and we ought to understand that and not play at war. We ought to accept this terrible necessity sternly and seriously. It all lies in that: get rid of falsehood and let war be war and not a game. As it is now, war is the favorite pastime of the idle and frivolous. The military calling is the most highly honored.\n\n\u201cBut what is war? What is needed for success in warfare? What are the habits of the military? The aim of war is murder; the methods of war are spying, treachery, and their encouragement, the ruin of a country\u2019s inhabitants, robbing them or stealing to provision the army, and fraud and falsehood termed military craft. The habits of the military class are the absence of freedom, that is, discipline, idleness, ignorance, cruelty, debauchery, and drunkenness. And in spite of all this it is the highest class, respected by everyone. All the kings, except the Chinese, wear military uniforms, and he who kills most people receives the highest rewards.\n\n\u201cThey meet, as we shall meet tomorrow, to murder one another; they kill and maim tens of thousands, and then have thanksgiving services for having killed so many people (they even exaggerate the number), and they announce a victory, supposing that the more people they have killed the greater their achievement. How does God above look at them and hear them?\u201d exclaimed Prince Andrew in a shrill, piercing voice. \u201cAh, my friend, it has of late become hard for me to live. I see that I have begun to understand too much. And it doesn\u2019t do for man to taste of the tree of knowledge of good and evil.... Ah, well, it\u2019s not for long!\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cHowever, you\u2019re sleepy, and it\u2019s time for me to sleep. Go back to G\u00f3rki!\u201d said Prince Andrew suddenly.\n\n\u201cOh no!\u201d Pierre replied, looking at Prince Andrew with frightened, compassionate eyes.\n\n\u201cGo, go! Before a battle one must have one\u2019s sleep out,\u201d repeated Prince Andrew.\n\nHe came quickly up to Pierre and embraced and kissed him. \u201cGood-by, be off!\u201d he shouted. \u201cWhether we meet again or not...\u201d and turning away hurriedly he entered the shed.\n\nIt was already dark, and Pierre could not make out whether the expression of Prince Andrew\u2019s face was angry or tender.\n\nFor some time he stood in silence considering whether he should follow him or go away. \u201cNo, he does not want it!\u201d Pierre concluded. \u201cAnd I know that this is our last meeting!\u201d He sighed deeply and rode back to G\u00f3rki.\n\nOn re-entering the shed Prince Andrew lay down on a rug, but he could not sleep.\n\nHe closed his eyes. One picture succeeded another in his imagination. On one of them he dwelt long and joyfully. He vividly recalled an evening in Petersburg. Nat\u00e1sha with animated and excited face was telling him how she had gone to look for mushrooms the previous summer and had lost her way in the big forest. She incoherently described the depths of the forest, her feelings, and a talk with a beekeeper she met, and constantly interrupted her story to say: \u201cNo, I can\u2019t! I\u2019m not telling it right; no, you don\u2019t understand,\u201d though he encouraged her by saying that he did understand, and he really had understood all she wanted to say. But Nat\u00e1sha was not satisfied with her own words: she felt that they did not convey the passionately poetic feeling she had experienced that day and wished to convey. \u201cHe was such a delightful old man, and it was so dark in the forest... and he had such kind... No, I can\u2019t describe it,\u201d she had said, flushed and excited. Prince Andrew smiled now the same happy smile as then when he had looked into her eyes. \u201cI understood her,\u201d he thought. \u201cI not only understood her, but it was just that inner, spiritual force, that sincerity, that frankness of soul\u2014that very soul of hers which seemed to be fettered by her body\u2014it was that soul I loved in her... loved so strongly and happily...\u201d and suddenly he remembered how his love had ended. \u201cHe did not need anything of that kind. He neither saw nor understood anything of the sort. He only saw in her a pretty and fresh young girl, with whom he did not deign to unite his fate. And I?... and he is still alive and gay!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew jumped up as if someone had burned him, and again began pacing up and down in front of the shed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nOn August 25, the eve of the battle of Borodin\u00f3, M. de Beausset, prefect of the French Emperor\u2019s palace, arrived at Napoleon\u2019s quarters at Val\u00faevo with Colonel Fabvier, the former from Paris and the latter from Madrid.\n\nDonning his court uniform, M. de Beausset ordered a box he had brought for the Emperor to be carried before him and entered the first compartment of Napoleon\u2019s tent, where he began opening the box while conversing with Napoleon\u2019s aides-de-camp who surrounded him.\n\nFabvier, not entering the tent, remained at the entrance talking to some generals of his acquaintance.\n\nThe Emperor Napoleon had not yet left his bedroom and was finishing his toilet. Slightly snorting and grunting, he presented now his back and now his plump hairy chest to the brush with which his valet was rubbing him down. Another valet, with his finger over the mouth of a bottle, was sprinkling Eau de Cologne on the Emperor\u2019s pampered body with an expression which seemed to say that he alone knew where and how much Eau de Cologne should be sprinkled. Napoleon\u2019s short hair was wet and matted on the forehead, but his face, though puffy and yellow, expressed physical satisfaction. \u201cGo on, harder, go on!\u201d he muttered to the valet who was rubbing him, slightly twitching and grunting. An aide-de-camp, who had entered the bedroom to report to the Emperor the number of prisoners taken in yesterday\u2019s action, was standing by the door after delivering his message, awaiting permission to withdraw. Napoleon, frowning, looked at him from under his brows.\n\n\u201cNo prisoners!\u201d said he, repeating the aide-de-camp\u2019s words. \u201cThey are forcing us to exterminate them. So much the worse for the Russian army.... Go on... harder, harder!\u201d he muttered, hunching his back and presenting his fat shoulders.\n\n\u201cAll right. Let Monsieur de Beausset enter, and Fabvier too,\u201d he said, nodding to the aide-de-camp.\n\n\u201cYes, sire,\u201d and the aide-de-camp disappeared through the door of the tent.\n\nTwo valets rapidly dressed His Majesty, and wearing the blue uniform of the Guards he went with firm quick steps to the reception room.\n\nDe Beausset\u2019s hands meanwhile were busily engaged arranging the present he had brought from the Empress, on two chairs directly in front of the entrance. But Napoleon had dressed and come out with such unexpected rapidity that he had not time to finish arranging the surprise.\n\nNapoleon noticed at once what they were about and guessed that they were not ready. He did not wish to deprive them of the pleasure of giving him a surprise, so he pretended not to see de Beausset and called Fabvier to him, listening silently and with a stern frown to what Fabvier told him of the heroism and devotion of his troops fighting at Salamanca, at the other end of Europe, with but one thought\u2014to be worthy of their Emperor\u2014and but one fear\u2014to fail to please him. The result of that battle had been deplorable. Napoleon made ironic remarks during Fabvier\u2019s account, as if he had not expected that matters could go otherwise in his absence.\n\n\u201cI must make up for that in Moscow,\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cI\u2019ll see you later,\u201d he added, and summoned de Beausset, who by that time had prepared the surprise, having placed something on the chairs and covered it with a cloth.\n\nDe Beausset bowed low, with that courtly French bow which only the old retainers of the Bourbons knew how to make, and approached him, presenting an envelope.\n\nNapoleon turned to him gaily and pulled his ear.\n\n\u201cYou have hurried here. I am very glad. Well, what is Paris saying?\u201d he asked, suddenly changing his former stern expression for a most cordial tone.\n\n\u201cSire, all Paris regrets your absence,\u201d replied de Beausset as was proper.\n\nBut though Napoleon knew that de Beausset had to say something of this kind, and though in his lucid moments he knew it was untrue, he was pleased to hear it from him. Again he honored him by touching his ear.\n\n\u201cI am very sorry to have made you travel so far,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cSire, I expected nothing less than to find you at the gates of Moscow,\u201d replied de Beausset.\n\nNapoleon smiled and, lifting his head absent-mindedly, glanced to the right. An aide-de-camp approached with gliding steps and offered him a gold snuffbox, which he took.\n\n\u201cYes, it has happened luckily for you,\u201d he said, raising the open snuffbox to his nose. \u201cYou are fond of travel, and in three days you will see Moscow. You surely did not expect to see that Asiatic capital. You will have a pleasant journey.\u201d\n\nDe Beausset bowed gratefully at this regard for his taste for travel (of which he had not till then been aware).\n\n\u201cHa, what\u2019s this?\u201d asked Napoleon, noticing that all the courtiers were looking at something concealed under a cloth.\n\nWith courtly adroitness de Beausset half turned and without turning his back to the Emperor retired two steps, twitching off the cloth at the same time, and said:\n\n\u201cA present to Your Majesty from the Empress.\u201d\n\nIt was a portrait, painted in bright colors by G\u00e9rard, of the son borne to Napoleon by the daughter of the Emperor of Austria, the boy whom for some reason everyone called \u201cThe King of Rome.\u201d\n\nA very pretty curly-headed boy with a look of the Christ in the Sistine Madonna was depicted playing at stick and ball. The ball represented the terrestrial globe and the stick in his other hand a scepter.\n\nThough it was not clear what the artist meant to express by depicting the so-called King of Rome spiking the earth with a stick, the allegory apparently seemed to Napoleon, as it had done to all who had seen it in Paris, quite clear and very pleasing.\n\n\u201cThe King of Rome!\u201d he said, pointing to the portrait with a graceful gesture. \u201cAdmirable!\u201d\n\nWith the natural capacity of an Italian for changing the expression of his face at will, he drew nearer to the portrait and assumed a look of pensive tenderness. He felt that what he now said and did would be historical, and it seemed to him that it would now be best for him\u2014whose grandeur enabled his son to play stick and ball with the terrestrial globe\u2014to show, in contrast to that grandeur, the simplest paternal tenderness. His eyes grew dim, he moved forward, glanced round at a chair (which seemed to place itself under him), and sat down on it before the portrait. At a single gesture from him everyone went out on tiptoe, leaving the great man to himself and his emotion.\n\nHaving sat still for a while he touched\u2014himself not knowing why\u2014the thick spot of paint representing the highest light in the portrait, rose, and recalled de Beausset and the officer on duty. He ordered the portrait to be carried outside his tent, that the Old Guard, stationed round it, might not be deprived of the pleasure of seeing the King of Rome, the son and heir of their adored monarch.\n\nAnd while he was doing M. de Beausset the honor of breakfasting with him, they heard, as Napoleon had anticipated, the rapturous cries of the officers and men of the Old Guard who had run up to see the portrait.\n\n\u201cVive l\u2019Empereur! Vive le roi de Rome! Vive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d came those ecstatic cries.\n\nAfter breakfast Napoleon in de Beausset\u2019s presence dictated his order of the day to the army.\n\n\u201cShort and energetic!\u201d he remarked when he had read over the proclamation which he had dictated straight off without corrections. It ran:\n\nSoldiers! This is the battle you have so longed for. Victory depends on you. It is essential for us; it will give us all we need: comfortable quarters and a speedy return to our country. Behave as you did at Austerlitz, Friedland, V\u00edtebsk, and Smol\u00e9nsk. Let our remotest posterity recall your achievements this day with pride. Let it be said of each of you: \u201cHe was in the great battle before Moscow!\u201d\n\n\u201cBefore Moscow!\u201d repeated Napoleon, and inviting M. de Beausset, who was so fond of travel, to accompany him on his ride, he went out of the tent to where the horses stood saddled.\n\n\u201cYour Majesty is too kind!\u201d replied de Beausset to the invitation to accompany the Emperor; he wanted to sleep, did not know how to ride and was afraid of doing so.\n\nBut Napoleon nodded to the traveler, and de Beausset had to mount. When Napoleon came out of the tent the shouting of the Guards before his son\u2019s portrait grew still louder. Napoleon frowned.\n\n\u201cTake him away!\u201d he said, pointing with a gracefully majestic gesture to the portrait. \u201cIt is too soon for him to see a field of battle.\u201d\n\nDe Beausset closed his eyes, bowed his head, and sighed deeply, to indicate how profoundly he valued and comprehended the Emperor\u2019s words.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nOn the twenty-fifth of August, so his historians tell us, Napoleon spent the whole day on horseback inspecting the locality, considering plans submitted to him by his marshals, and personally giving commands to his generals.\n\nThe original line of the Russian forces along the river Koloch\u00e1 had been dislocated by the capture of the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt on the twenty-fourth, and part of the line\u2014the left flank\u2014had been drawn back. That part of the line was not entrenched and in front of it the ground was more open and level than elsewhere. It was evident to anyone, military or not, that it was here the French should attack. It would seem that not much consideration was needed to reach this conclusion, nor any particular care or trouble on the part of the Emperor and his marshals, nor was there any need of that special and supreme quality called genius that people are so apt to ascribe to Napoleon; yet the historians who described the event later and the men who then surrounded Napoleon, and he himself, thought otherwise.\n\nNapoleon rode over the plain and surveyed the locality with a profound air and in silence, nodded with approval or shook his head dubiously, and without communicating to the generals around him the profound course of ideas which guided his decisions merely gave them his final conclusions in the form of commands. Having listened to a suggestion from Davout, who was now called Prince d\u2019Eckm\u00fchl, to turn the Russian left wing, Napoleon said it should not be done, without explaining why not. To a proposal made by General Campan (who was to attack the fl\u00e8ches) to lead his division through the woods, Napoleon agreed, though the so-called Duke of Elchingen (Ney) ventured to remark that a movement through the woods was dangerous and might disorder the division.\n\nHaving inspected the country opposite the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt, Napoleon pondered a little in silence and then indicated the spots where two batteries should be set up by the morrow to act against the Russian entrenchments, and the places where, in line with them, the field artillery should be placed.\n\nAfter giving these and other commands he returned to his tent, and the dispositions for the battle were written down from his dictation.\n\nThese dispositions, of which the French historians write with enthusiasm and other historians with profound respect, were as follows:\n\nAt dawn the two new batteries established during the night on the plain occupied by the Prince d\u2019Eckm\u00fchl will open fire on the opposing batteries of the enemy.\n\nAt the same time the commander of the artillery of the 1st Corps, General Pernetti, with thirty cannon of Campan\u2019s division and all the howitzers of Dessaix\u2019s and Friant\u2019s divisions, will move forward, open fire, and overwhelm with shellfire the enemy\u2019s battery, against which will operate:\n\n\n        24 guns of the artillery of the Guards\n        30 guns of Campan\u2019s division\n\n and     8 guns of Friant\u2019s and Dessaix\u2019s divisions\n        \u2014\n\n in all 62 guns.\n\n\nThe commander of the artillery of the 3rd Corps, General Fouch\u00e9, will place the howitzers of the 3rd and 8th Corps, sixteen in all, on the flanks of the battery that is to bombard the entrenchment on the left, which will have forty guns in all directed against it.\n\nGeneral Sorbier must be ready at the first order to advance with all the howitzers of the Guard\u2019s artillery against either one or other of the entrenchments.\n\nDuring the cannonade Prince Poniatowski is to advance through the wood on the village and turn the enemy\u2019s position.\n\nGeneral Campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification.\n\nAfter the advance has begun in this manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy\u2019s movements.\n\nThe cannonade on the left flank will begin as soon as the guns of the right wing are heard. The sharpshooters of Morand\u2019s division and of the vice-King\u2019s division will open a heavy fire on seeing the attack commence on the right wing.\n\nThe vice-King will occupy the village and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand\u2019s and Gibrard\u2019s divisions, which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.\n\nAll this must be done in good order (le tout se fera avec ordre et m\u00e9thode) as far as possible retaining troops in reserve.\n\nThe Imperial Camp near Mozh\u00e1ysk,\n\nSeptember, 6, 1812.\n\n\nThese dispositions, which are very obscure and confused if one allows oneself to regard the arrangements without religious awe of his genius, related to Napoleon\u2019s orders to deal with four points\u2014four different orders. Not one of these was, or could be, carried out.\n\nIn the disposition it is said first that the batteries placed on the spot chosen by Napoleon, with the guns of Pernetti and Fouch\u00e9; which were to come in line with them, 102 guns in all, were to open fire and shower shells on the Russian fl\u00e8ches and redoubts. This could not be done, as from the spots selected by Napoleon the projectiles did not carry to the Russian works, and those 102 guns shot into the air until the nearest commander, contrary to Napoleon\u2019s instructions, moved them forward.\n\nThe second order was that Poniatowski, moving to the village through the wood, should turn the Russian left flank. This could not be done and was not done, because Poniatowski, advancing on the village through the wood, met T\u00fachkov there barring his way, and could not and did not turn the Russian position.\n\nThe third order was: General Campan will move through the wood to seize the first fortification. General Campan\u2019s division did not seize the first fortification but was driven back, for on emerging from the wood it had to reform under grapeshot, of which Napoleon was unaware.\n\nThe fourth order was: The vice-King will occupy the village (Borodin\u00f3) and cross by its three bridges, advancing to the same heights as Morand\u2019s and G\u00e9rard\u2019s divisions (for whose movements no directions are given), which under his leadership will be directed against the redoubt and come into line with the rest of the forces.\n\nAs far as one can make out, not so much from this unintelligible sentence as from the attempts the vice-King made to execute the orders given him, he was to advance from the left through Borodin\u00f3 to the redoubt while the divisions of Morand and G\u00e9rard were to advance simultaneously from the front.\n\nAll this, like the other parts of the disposition, was not and could not be executed. After passing through Borodin\u00f3 the vice-King was driven back to the Koloch\u00e1 and could get no farther; while the divisions of Morand and G\u00e9rard did not take the redoubt but were driven back, and the redoubt was only taken at the end of the battle by the cavalry (a thing probably unforeseen and not heard of by Napoleon). So not one of the orders in the disposition was, or could be, executed. But in the disposition it is said that, after the fight has commenced in this manner, orders will be given in accordance with the enemy\u2019s movements, and so it might be supposed that all necessary arrangements would be made by Napoleon during the battle. But this was not and could not be done, for during the whole battle Napoleon was so far away that, as appeared later, he could not know the course of the battle and not one of his orders during the fight could be executed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nMany historians say that the French did not win the battle of Borodin\u00f3 because Napoleon had a cold, and that if he had not had a cold the orders he gave before and during the battle would have been still more full of genius and Russia would have been lost and the face of the world have been changed. To historians who believe that Russia was shaped by the will of one man\u2014Peter the Great\u2014and that France from a republic became an empire and French armies went to Russia at the will of one man\u2014Napoleon\u2014to say that Russia remained a power because Napoleon had a bad cold on the twenty-fourth of August may seem logical and convincing.\n\nIf it had depended on Napoleon\u2019s will to fight or not to fight the battle of Borodin\u00f3, and if this or that other arrangement depended on his will, then evidently a cold affecting the manifestation of his will might have saved Russia, and consequently the valet who omitted to bring Napoleon his waterproof boots on the twenty-fourth would have been the savior of Russia. Along that line of thought such a deduction is indubitable, as indubitable as the deduction Voltaire made in jest (without knowing what he was jesting at) when he saw that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was due to Charles IX\u2019s stomach being deranged. But to men who do not admit that Russia was formed by the will of one man, Peter I, or that the French Empire was formed and the war with Russia begun by the will of one man, Napoleon, that argument seems not merely untrue and irrational, but contrary to all human reality. To the question of what causes historic events another answer presents itself, namely, that the course of human events is predetermined from on high\u2014depends on the coincidence of the wills of all who take part in the events, and that a Napoleon\u2019s influence on the course of these events is purely external and fictitious.\n\nStrange as at first glance it may seem to suppose that the Massacre of St. Bartholomew was not due to Charles IX\u2019s will, though he gave the order for it and thought it was done as a result of that order; and strange as it may seem to suppose that the slaughter of eighty thousand men at Borodin\u00f3 was not due to Napoleon\u2019s will, though he ordered the commencement and conduct of the battle and thought it was done because he ordered it; strange as these suppositions appear, yet human dignity\u2014which tells me that each of us is, if not more at least not less a man than the great Napoleon\u2014demands the acceptance of that solution of the question, and historic investigation abundantly confirms it.\n\nAt the battle of Borodin\u00f3 Napoleon shot at no one and killed no one. That was all done by the soldiers. Therefore it was not he who killed people.\n\nThe French soldiers went to kill and be killed at the battle of Borodin\u00f3 not because of Napoleon\u2019s orders but by their own volition. The whole army\u2014French, Italian, German, Polish, and Dutch\u2014hungry, ragged, and weary of the campaign, felt at the sight of an army blocking their road to Moscow that the wine was drawn and must be drunk. Had Napoleon then forbidden them to fight the Russians, they would have killed him and have proceeded to fight the Russians because it was inevitable.\n\nWhen they heard Napoleon\u2019s proclamation offering them, as compensation for mutilation and death, the words of posterity about their having been in the battle before Moscow, they cried \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d just as they had cried \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d at the sight of the portrait of the boy piercing the terrestrial globe with a toy stick, and just as they would have cried \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d at any nonsense that might be told them. There was nothing left for them to do but cry \u201cVive l\u2019Empereur!\u201d and go to fight, in order to get food and rest as conquerors in Moscow. So it was not because of Napoleon\u2019s commands that they killed their fellow men.\n\nAnd it was not Napoleon who directed the course of the battle, for none of his orders were executed and during the battle he did not know what was going on before him. So the way in which these people killed one another was not decided by Napoleon\u2019s will but occurred independently of him, in accord with the will of hundreds of thousands of people who took part in the common action. It only seemed to Napoleon that it all took place by his will. And so the question whether he had or had not a cold has no more historic interest than the cold of the least of the transport soldiers.\n\nMoreover, the assertion made by various writers that his cold was the cause of his dispositions not being as well-planned as on former occasions, and of his orders during the battle not being as good as previously, is quite baseless, which again shows that Napoleon\u2019s cold on the twenty-sixth of August was unimportant.\n\nThe dispositions cited above are not at all worse, but are even better, than previous dispositions by which he had won victories. His pseudo-orders during the battle were also no worse than formerly, but much the same as usual. These dispositions and orders only seem worse than previous ones because the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was the first Napoleon did not win. The profoundest and most excellent dispositions and orders seem very bad, and every learned militarist criticizes them with looks of importance, when they relate to a battle that has been lost, and the very worst dispositions and orders seem very good, and serious people fill whole volumes to demonstrate their merits, when they relate to a battle that has been won.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Weyrother for the battle of Austerlitz were a model of perfection for that kind of composition, but still they were criticized\u2014criticized for their very perfection, for their excessive minuteness.\n\nNapoleon at the battle of Borodin\u00f3 fulfilled his office as representative of authority as well as, and even better than, at other battles. He did nothing harmful to the progress of the battle; he inclined to the most reasonable opinions, he made no confusion, did not contradict himself, did not get frightened or run away from the field of battle, but with his great tact and military experience carried out his role of appearing to command, calmly and with dignity.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nOn returning from a second inspection of the lines, Napoleon remarked:\n\n\u201cThe chessmen are set up, the game will begin tomorrow!\u201d\n\nHaving ordered punch and summoned de Beausset, he began to talk to him about Paris and about some changes he meant to make in the Empress\u2019 household, surprising the prefect by his memory of minute details relating to the court.\n\nHe showed an interest in trifles, joked about de Beausset\u2019s love of travel, and chatted carelessly, as a famous, self-confident surgeon who knows his job does when turning up his sleeves and putting on his apron while a patient is being strapped to the operating table. \u201cThe matter is in my hands and is clear and definite in my head. When the time comes to set to work I shall do it as no one else could, but now I can jest, and the more I jest and the calmer I am the more tranquil and confident you ought to be, and the more amazed at my genius.\u201d\n\nHaving finished his second glass of punch, Napoleon went to rest before the serious business which, he considered, awaited him next day. He was so much interested in that task that he was unable to sleep, and in spite of his cold which had grown worse from the dampness of the evening, he went into the large division of the tent at three o\u2019clock in the morning, loudly blowing his nose. He asked whether the Russians had not withdrawn, and was told that the enemy\u2019s fires were still in the same places. He nodded approval.\n\nThe adjutant in attendance came into the tent.\n\n\u201cWell, Rapp, do you think we shall do good business today?\u201d Napoleon asked him.\n\n\u201cWithout doubt, sire,\u201d replied Rapp.\n\nNapoleon looked at him.\n\n\u201cDo you remember, sire, what you did me the honor to say at Smol\u00e9nsk?\u201d continued Rapp. \u201cThe wine is drawn and must be drunk.\u201d\n\nNapoleon frowned and sat silent for a long time leaning his head on his hand.\n\n\u201cThis poor army!\u201d he suddenly remarked. \u201cIt has diminished greatly since Smol\u00e9nsk. Fortune is frankly a courtesan, Rapp. I have always said so and I am beginning to experience it. But the Guards, Rapp, the Guards are intact?\u201d he remarked interrogatively.\n\n\u201cYes, sire,\u201d replied Rapp.\n\nNapoleon took a lozenge, put it in his mouth, and glanced at his watch. He was not sleepy and it was still not nearly morning. It was impossible to give further orders for the sake of killing time, for the orders had all been given and were now being executed.\n\n\u201cHave the biscuits and rice been served out to the regiments of the Guards?\u201d asked Napoleon sternly.\n\n\u201cYes, sire.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe rice too?\u201d\n\nRapp replied that he had given the Emperor\u2019s order about the rice, but Napoleon shook his head in dissatisfaction as if not believing that his order had been executed. An attendant came in with punch. Napoleon ordered another glass to be brought for Rapp, and silently sipped his own.\n\n\u201cI have neither taste nor smell,\u201d he remarked, sniffing at his glass. \u201cThis cold is tiresome. They talk about medicine\u2014what is the good of medicine when it can\u2019t cure a cold! Corvisart gave me these lozenges but they don\u2019t help at all. What can doctors cure? One can\u2019t cure anything. Our body is a machine for living. It is organized for that, it is its nature. Let life go on in it unhindered and let it defend itself, it will do more than if you paralyze it by encumbering it with remedies. Our body is like a perfect watch that should go for a certain time; the watchmaker cannot open it, he can only adjust it by fumbling, and that blindfold.... Yes, our body is just a machine for living, that is all.\u201d\n\nAnd having entered on the path of definition, of which he was fond, Napoleon suddenly and unexpectedly gave a new one.\n\n\u201cDo you know, Rapp, what military art is?\u201d asked he. \u201cIt is the art of being stronger than the enemy at a given moment. That\u2019s all.\u201d\n\nRapp made no reply.\n\n\u201cTomorrow we shall have to deal with Kut\u00fazov!\u201d said Napoleon. \u201cWe shall see! Do you remember at Braunau he commanded an army for three weeks and did not once mount a horse to inspect his entrenchments.... We shall see!\u201d\n\nHe looked at his watch. It was still only four o\u2019clock. He did not feel sleepy. The punch was finished and there was still nothing to do. He rose, walked to and fro, put on a warm overcoat and a hat, and went out of the tent. The night was dark and damp, a scarcely perceptible moisture was descending from above. Near by, the campfires were dimly burning among the French Guards, and in the distance those of the Russian line shone through the smoke. The weather was calm, and the rustle and tramp of the French troops already beginning to move to take up their positions were clearly audible.\n\nNapoleon walked about in front of his tent, looked at the fires and listened to these sounds, and as he was passing a tall guardsman in a shaggy cap, who was standing sentinel before his tent and had drawn himself up like a black pillar at sight of the Emperor, Napoleon stopped in front of him.\n\n\u201cWhat year did you enter the service?\u201d he asked with that affectation of military bluntness and geniality with which he always addressed the soldiers.\n\nThe man answered the question.\n\n\u201cAh! One of the old ones! Has your regiment had its rice?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt has, Your Majesty.\u201d\n\nNapoleon nodded and walked away.\n\n\nAt half-past five Napoleon rode to the village of Shev\u00e1rdino.\n\nIt was growing light, the sky was clearing, only a single cloud lay in the east. The abandoned campfires were burning themselves out in the faint morning light.\n\nOn the right a single deep report of a cannon resounded and died away in the prevailing silence. Some minutes passed. A second and a third report shook the air, then a fourth and a fifth boomed solemnly near by on the right.\n\nThe first shots had not yet ceased to reverberate before others rang out and yet more were heard mingling with and overtaking one another.\n\nNapoleon with his suite rode up to the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt where he dismounted. The game had begun.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nOn returning to G\u00f3rki after having seen Prince Andrew, Pierre ordered his groom to get the horses ready and to call him early in the morning, and then immediately fell asleep behind a partition in a corner Bor\u00eds had given up to him.\n\nBefore he was thoroughly awake next morning everybody had already left the hut. The panes were rattling in the little windows and his groom was shaking him.\n\n\u201cYour excellency! Your excellency! Your excellency!\u201d he kept repeating pertinaciously while he shook Pierre by the shoulder without looking at him, having apparently lost hope of getting him to wake up.\n\n\u201cWhat? Has it begun? Is it time?\u201d Pierre asked, waking up.\n\n\u201cHear the firing,\u201d said the groom, a discharged soldier. \u201cAll the gentlemen have gone out, and his Serene Highness himself rode past long ago.\u201d\n\nPierre dressed hastily and ran out to the porch. Outside all was bright, fresh, dewy, and cheerful. The sun, just bursting forth from behind a cloud that had concealed it, was shining, with rays still half broken by the clouds, over the roofs of the street opposite, on the dew-besprinkled dust of the road, on the walls of the houses, on the windows, the fence, and on Pierre\u2019s horses standing before the hut. The roar of guns sounded more distinct outside. An adjutant accompanied by a Cossack passed by at a sharp trot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s time, Count; it\u2019s time!\u201d cried the adjutant.\n\nTelling the groom to follow him with the horses, Pierre went down the street to the knoll from which he had looked at the field of battle the day before. A crowd of military men was assembled there, members of the staff could be heard conversing in French, and Kut\u00fazov\u2019s gray head in a white cap with a red band was visible, his gray nape sunk between his shoulders. He was looking through a field glass down the highroad before him.\n\nMounting the steps to the knoll Pierre looked at the scene before him, spellbound by beauty. It was the same panorama he had admired from that spot the day before, but now the whole place was full of troops and covered by smoke clouds from the guns, and the slanting rays of the bright sun, rising slightly to the left behind Pierre, cast upon it through the clear morning air penetrating streaks of rosy, golden-tinted light and long dark shadows. The forest at the farthest extremity of the panorama seemed carved in some precious stone of a yellowish-green color; its undulating outline was silhouetted against the horizon and was pierced beyond Val\u00faevo by the Smol\u00e9nsk highroad crowded with troops. Nearer at hand glittered golden cornfields interspersed with copses. There were troops to be seen everywhere, in front and to the right and left. All this was vivid, majestic, and unexpected; but what impressed Pierre most of all was the view of the battlefield itself, of Borodin\u00f3 and the hollows on both sides of the Koloch\u00e1.\n\nAbove the Koloch\u00e1, in Borodin\u00f3 and on both sides of it, especially to the left where the V\u00f3yna flowing between its marshy banks falls into the Koloch\u00e1, a mist had spread which seemed to melt, to dissolve, and to become translucent when the brilliant sun appeared and magically colored and outlined everything. The smoke of the guns mingled with this mist, and over the whole expanse and through that mist the rays of the morning sun were reflected, flashing back like lightning from the water, from the dew, and from the bayonets of the troops crowded together by the riverbanks and in Borodin\u00f3. A white church could be seen through the mist, and here and there the roofs of huts in Borodin\u00f3 as well as dense masses of soldiers, or green ammunition chests and ordnance. And all this moved, or seemed to move, as the smoke and mist spread out over the whole space. Just as in the mist-enveloped hollow near Borodin\u00f3, so along the entire line outside and above it and especially in the woods and fields to the left, in the valleys and on the summits of the high ground, clouds of powder smoke seemed continually to spring up out of nothing, now singly, now several at a time, some translucent, others dense, which, swelling, growing, rolling, and blending, extended over the whole expanse.\n\nThese puffs of smoke and (strange to say) the sound of the firing produced the chief beauty of the spectacle.\n\n\u201cPuff!\u201d\u2014suddenly a round compact cloud of smoke was seen merging from violet into gray and milky white, and \u201cboom!\u201d came the report a second later.\n\n\u201cPuff! puff!\u201d\u2014and two clouds arose pushing one another and blending together; and \u201cboom, boom!\u201d came the sounds confirming what the eye had seen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the first cloud, which he had seen as a round compact ball, and in its place already were balloons of smoke floating to one side, and\u2014\u201cpuff\u201d (with a pause)\u2014\u201cpuff, puff!\u201d three and then four more appeared and then from each, with the same interval\u2014\u201cboom\u2014boom, boom!\u201d came the fine, firm, precise sounds in reply. It seemed as if those smoke clouds sometimes ran and sometimes stood still while woods, fields, and glittering bayonets ran past them. From the left, over fields and bushes, those large balls of smoke were continually appearing followed by their solemn reports, while nearer still, in the hollows and woods, there burst from the muskets small cloudlets that had no time to become balls, but had their little echoes in just the same way. \u201cTrakh-ta-ta-takh!\u201d came the frequent crackle of musketry, but it was irregular and feeble in comparison with the reports of the cannon.\n\nPierre wished to be there with that smoke, those shining bayonets, that movement, and those sounds. He turned to look at Kut\u00fazov and his suite, to compare his impressions with those of others. They were all looking at the field of battle as he was, and, as it seemed to him, with the same feelings. All their faces were now shining with that latent warmth of feeling Pierre had noticed the day before and had fully understood after his talk with Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cGo, my dear fellow, go... and Christ be with you!\u201d Kut\u00fazov was saying to a general who stood beside him, not taking his eye from the battlefield.\n\nHaving received this order the general passed by Pierre on his way down the knoll.\n\n\u201cTo the crossing!\u201d said the general coldly and sternly in reply to one of the staff who asked where he was going.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go there too, I too!\u201d thought Pierre, and followed the general.\n\nThe general mounted a horse a Cossack had brought him. Pierre went to his groom who was holding his horses and, asking which was the quietest, clambered onto it, seized it by the mane, and turning out his toes pressed his heels against its sides and, feeling that his spectacles were slipping off but unable to let go of the mane and reins, he galloped after the general, causing the staff officers to smile as they watched him from the knoll.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nHaving descended the hill the general after whom Pierre was galloping turned sharply to the left, and Pierre, losing sight of him, galloped in among some ranks of infantry marching ahead of him. He tried to pass either in front of them or to the right or left, but there were soldiers everywhere, all with the same preoccupied expression and busy with some unseen but evidently important task. They all gazed with the same dissatisfied and inquiring expression at this stout man in a white hat, who for some unknown reason threatened to trample them under his horse\u2019s hoofs.\n\n\u201cWhy ride into the middle of the battalion?\u201d one of them shouted at him.\n\nAnother prodded his horse with the butt end of a musket, and Pierre, bending over his saddlebow and hardly able to control his shying horse, galloped ahead of the soldiers where there was a free space.\n\nThere was a bridge ahead of him, where other soldiers stood firing. Pierre rode up to them. Without being aware of it he had come to the bridge across the Koloch\u00e1 between G\u00f3rki and Borodin\u00f3, which the French (having occupied Borodin\u00f3) were attacking in the first phase of the battle. Pierre saw that there was a bridge in front of him and that soldiers were doing something on both sides of it and in the meadow, among the rows of new-mown hay which he had taken no notice of amid the smoke of the campfires the day before; but despite the incessant firing going on there he had no idea that this was the field of battle. He did not notice the sound of the bullets whistling from every side, or the projectiles that flew over him, did not see the enemy on the other side of the river, and for a long time did not notice the killed and wounded, though many fell near him. He looked about him with a smile which did not leave his face.\n\n\u201cWhy\u2019s that fellow in front of the line?\u201d shouted somebody at him again.\n\n\u201cTo the left!... Keep to the right!\u201d the men shouted to him.\n\nPierre went to the right, and unexpectedly encountered one of Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s adjutants whom he knew. The adjutant looked angrily at him, evidently also intending to shout at him, but on recognizing him he nodded.\n\n\u201cHow have you got here?\u201d he said, and galloped on.\n\nPierre, feeling out of place there, having nothing to do, and afraid of getting in someone\u2019s way again, galloped after the adjutant.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening here? May I come with you?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOne moment, one moment!\u201d replied the adjutant, and riding up to a stout colonel who was standing in the meadow, he gave him some message and then addressed Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhy have you come here, Count?\u201d he asked with a smile. \u201cStill inquisitive?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d assented Pierre.\n\nBut the adjutant turned his horse about and rode on.\n\n\u201cHere it\u2019s tolerable,\u201d said he, \u201cbut with Bagrati\u00f3n on the left flank they\u2019re getting it frightfully hot.\u201d\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cWhere is that?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome along with me to our knoll. We can get a view from there and in our battery it is still bearable,\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cWill you come?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I\u2019ll come with you,\u201d replied Pierre, looking round for his groom.\n\nIt was only now that he noticed wounded men staggering along or being carried on stretchers. On that very meadow he had ridden over the day before, a soldier was lying athwart the rows of scented hay, with his head thrown awkwardly back and his shako off.\n\n\u201cWhy haven\u2019t they carried him away?\u201d Pierre was about to ask, but seeing the stern expression of the adjutant who was also looking that way, he checked himself.\n\nPierre did not find his groom and rode along the hollow with the adjutant to Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s Redoubt. His horse lagged behind the adjutant\u2019s and jolted him at every step.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t seem to be used to riding, Count?\u201d remarked the adjutant.\n\n\u201cNo it\u2019s not that, but her action seems so jerky,\u201d said Pierre in a puzzled tone.\n\n\u201cWhy... she\u2019s wounded!\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cIn the off foreleg above the knee. A bullet, no doubt. I congratulate you, Count, on your baptism of fire!\u201d\n\nHaving ridden in the smoke past the Sixth Corps, behind the artillery which had been moved forward and was in action, deafening them with the noise of firing, they came to a small wood. There it was cool and quiet, with a scent of autumn. Pierre and the adjutant dismounted and walked up the hill on foot.\n\n\u201cIs the general here?\u201d asked the adjutant on reaching the knoll.\n\n\u201cHe was here a minute ago but has just gone that way,\u201d someone told him, pointing to the right.\n\nThe adjutant looked at Pierre as if puzzled what to do with him now.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t trouble about me,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cI\u2019ll go up onto the knoll if I may?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, do. You\u2019ll see everything from there and it\u2019s less dangerous, and I\u2019ll come for you.\u201d\n\nPierre went to the battery and the adjutant rode on. They did not meet again, and only much later did Pierre learn that he lost an arm that day.\n\nThe knoll to which Pierre ascended was that famous one afterwards known to the Russians as the Knoll Battery or Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s Redoubt, and to the French as la grande redoute, la fatale redoute, la redoute du centre, around which tens of thousands fell, and which the French regarded as the key to the whole position.\n\nThis redoubt consisted of a knoll, on three sides of which trenches had been dug. Within the entrenchment stood ten guns that were being fired through openings in the earthwork.\n\nIn line with the knoll on both sides stood other guns which also fired incessantly. A little behind the guns stood infantry. When ascending that knoll Pierre had no notion that this spot, on which small trenches had been dug and from which a few guns were firing, was the most important point of the battle.\n\nOn the contrary, just because he happened to be there he thought it one of the least significant parts of the field.\n\nHaving reached the knoll, Pierre sat down at one end of a trench surrounding the battery and gazed at what was going on around him with an unconsciously happy smile. Occasionally he rose and walked about the battery still with that same smile, trying not to obstruct the soldiers who were loading, hauling the guns, and continually running past him with bags and charges. The guns of that battery were being fired continually one after another with a deafening roar, enveloping the whole neighborhood in powder smoke.\n\nIn contrast with the dread felt by the infantrymen placed in support, here in the battery where a small number of men busy at their work were separated from the rest by a trench, everyone experienced a common and as it were family feeling of animation.\n\nThe intrusion of Pierre\u2019s nonmilitary figure in a white hat made an unpleasant impression at first. The soldiers looked askance at him with surprise and even alarm as they went past him. The senior artillery officer, a tall, long-legged, pockmarked man, moved over to Pierre as if to see the action of the farthest gun and looked at him with curiosity.\n\nA young round-faced officer, quite a boy still and evidently only just out of the Cadet College, who was zealously commanding the two guns entrusted to him, addressed Pierre sternly.\n\n\u201cSir,\u201d he said, \u201cpermit me to ask you to stand aside. You must not be here.\u201d\n\nThe soldiers shook their heads disapprovingly as they looked at Pierre. But when they had convinced themselves that this man in the white hat was doing no harm, but either sat quietly on the slope of the trench with a shy smile or, politely making way for the soldiers, paced up and down the battery under fire as calmly as if he were on a boulevard, their feeling of hostile distrust gradually began to change into a kindly and bantering sympathy, such as soldiers feel for their dogs, cocks, goats, and in general for the animals that live with the regiment. The men soon accepted Pierre into their family, adopted him, gave him a nickname (\u201cour gentleman\u201d), and made kindly fun of him among themselves.\n\nA shell tore up the earth two paces from Pierre and he looked around with a smile as he brushed from his clothes some earth it had thrown up.\n\n\u201cAnd how\u2019s it you\u2019re not afraid, sir, really now?\u201d a red-faced, broad-shouldered soldier asked Pierre, with a grin that disclosed a set of sound, white teeth.\n\n\u201cAre you afraid, then?\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhat else do you expect?\u201d answered the soldier. \u201cShe has no mercy, you know! When she comes spluttering down, out go your innards. One can\u2019t help being afraid,\u201d he said laughing.\n\nSeveral of the men, with bright kindly faces, stopped beside Pierre. They seemed not to have expected him to talk like anybody else, and the discovery that he did so delighted them.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the business of us soldiers. But in a gentleman it\u2019s wonderful! There\u2019s a gentleman for you!\u201d\n\n\u201cTo your places!\u201d cried the young officer to the men gathered round Pierre.\n\nThe young officer was evidently exercising his duties for the first or second time and therefore treated both his superiors and the men with great precision and formality.\n\nThe booming cannonade and the fusillade of musketry were growing more intense over the whole field, especially to the left where Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s fl\u00e8ches were, but where Pierre was the smoke of the firing made it almost impossible to distinguish anything. Moreover, his whole attention was engrossed by watching the family circle\u2014separated from all else\u2014formed by the men in the battery. His first unconscious feeling of joyful animation produced by the sights and sounds of the battlefield was now replaced by another, especially since he had seen that soldier lying alone in the hayfield. Now, seated on the slope of the trench, he observed the faces of those around him.\n\nBy ten o\u2019clock some twenty men had already been carried away from the battery; two guns were smashed and cannon balls fell more and more frequently on the battery and spent bullets buzzed and whistled around. But the men in the battery seemed not to notice this, and merry voices and jokes were heard on all sides.\n\n\u201cA live one!\u201d shouted a man as a whistling shell approached.\n\n\u201cNot this way! To the infantry!\u201d added another with loud laughter, seeing the shell fly past and fall into the ranks of the supports.\n\n\u201cAre you bowing to a friend, eh?\u201d remarked another, chaffing a peasant who ducked low as a cannon ball flew over.\n\nSeveral soldiers gathered by the wall of the trench, looking out to see what was happening in front.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve withdrawn the front line, it has retired,\u201d said they, pointing over the earthwork.\n\n\u201cMind your own business,\u201d an old sergeant shouted at them. \u201cIf they\u2019ve retired it\u2019s because there\u2019s work for them to do farther back.\u201d\n\nAnd the sergeant, taking one of the men by the shoulders, gave him a shove with his knee. This was followed by a burst of laughter.\n\n\u201cTo the fifth gun, wheel it up!\u201d came shouts from one side.\n\n\u201cNow then, all together, like bargees!\u201d rose the merry voices of those who were moving the gun.\n\n\u201cOh, she nearly knocked our gentleman\u2019s hat off!\u201d cried the red-faced humorist, showing his teeth chaffing Pierre. \u201cAwkward baggage!\u201d he added reproachfully to a cannon ball that struck a cannon wheel and a man\u2019s leg.\n\n\u201cNow then, you foxes!\u201d said another, laughing at some militiamen who, stooping low, entered the battery to carry away the wounded man.\n\n\u201cSo this gruel isn\u2019t to your taste? Oh, you crows! You\u2019re scared!\u201d they shouted at the militiamen who stood hesitating before the man whose leg had been torn off.\n\n\u201cThere, lads... oh, oh!\u201d they mimicked the peasants, \u201cthey don\u2019t like it at all!\u201d\n\nPierre noticed that after every ball that hit the redoubt, and after every loss, the liveliness increased more and more.\n\nAs the flames of the fire hidden within come more and more vividly and rapidly from an approaching thundercloud, so, as if in opposition to what was taking place, the lightning of hidden fire growing more and more intense glowed in the faces of these men.\n\nPierre did not look out at the battlefield and was not concerned to know what was happening there; he was entirely absorbed in watching this fire which burned ever more brightly and which he felt was flaming up in the same way in his own soul.\n\nAt ten o\u2019clock the infantry that had been among the bushes in front of the battery and along the K\u00e1menka streamlet retreated. From the battery they could be seen running back past it carrying their wounded on their muskets. A general with his suite came to the battery, and after speaking to the colonel gave Pierre an angry look and went away again having ordered the infantry supports behind the battery to lie down, so as to be less exposed to fire. After this from amid the ranks of infantry to the right of the battery came the sound of a drum and shouts of command, and from the battery one saw how those ranks of infantry moved forward.\n\nPierre looked over the wall of the trench and was particularly struck by a pale young officer who, letting his sword hang down, was walking backwards and kept glancing uneasily around.\n\nThe ranks of the infantry disappeared amid the smoke but their long-drawn shout and rapid musketry firing could still be heard. A few minutes later crowds of wounded men and stretcher-bearers came back from that direction. Projectiles began to fall still more frequently in the battery. Several men were lying about who had not been removed. Around the cannon the men moved still more briskly and busily. No one any longer took notice of Pierre. Once or twice he was shouted at for being in the way. The senior officer moved with big, rapid strides from one gun to another with a frowning face. The young officer, with his face still more flushed, commanded the men more scrupulously than ever. The soldiers handed up the charges, turned, loaded, and did their business with strained smartness. They gave little jumps as they walked, as though they were on springs.\n\nThe stormcloud had come upon them, and in every face the fire which Pierre had watched kindle burned up brightly. Pierre standing beside the commanding officer. The young officer, his hand to his shako, ran up to his superior.\n\n\u201cI have the honor to report, sir, that only eight rounds are left. Are we to continue firing?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cGrapeshot!\u201d the senior shouted, without answering the question, looking over the wall of the trench.\n\nSuddenly something happened: the young officer gave a gasp and bending double sat down on the ground like a bird shot on the wing. Everything became strange, confused, and misty in Pierre\u2019s eyes.\n\nOne cannon ball after another whistled by and struck the earthwork, a soldier, or a gun. Pierre, who had not noticed these sounds before, now heard nothing else. On the right of the battery soldiers shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d were running not forwards but backwards, it seemed to Pierre.\n\nA cannon ball struck the very end of the earth work by which he was standing, crumbling down the earth; a black ball flashed before his eyes and at the same instant plumped into something. Some militiamen who were entering the battery ran back.\n\n\u201cAll with grapeshot!\u201d shouted the officer.\n\nThe sergeant ran up to the officer and in a frightened whisper informed him (as a butler at dinner informs his master that there is no more of some wine asked for) that there were no more charges.\n\n\u201cThe scoundrels! What are they doing?\u201d shouted the officer, turning to Pierre.\n\nThe officer\u2019s face was red and perspiring and his eyes glittered under his frowning brow.\n\n\u201cRun to the reserves and bring up the ammunition boxes!\u201d he yelled, angrily avoiding Pierre with his eyes and speaking to his men.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nThe officer, without answering him, strode across to the opposite side.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t fire.... Wait!\u201d he shouted.\n\nThe man who had been ordered to go for ammunition stumbled against Pierre.\n\n\u201cEh, sir, this is no place for you,\u201d said he, and ran down the slope.\n\nPierre ran after him, avoiding the spot where the young officer was sitting.\n\nOne cannon ball, another, and a third flew over him, falling in front, beside, and behind him. Pierre ran down the slope. \u201cWhere am I going?\u201d he suddenly asked himself when he was already near the green ammunition wagons. He halted irresolutely, not knowing whether to return or go on. Suddenly a terrible concussion threw him backwards to the ground. At the same instant he was dazzled by a great flash of flame, and immediately a deafening roar, crackling, and whistling made his ears tingle.\n\nWhen he came to himself he was sitting on the ground leaning on his hands; the ammunition wagons he had been approaching no longer existed, only charred green boards and rags littered the scorched grass, and a horse, dangling fragments of its shaft behind it, galloped past, while another horse lay, like Pierre, on the ground, uttering prolonged and piercing cries.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nBeside himself with terror Pierre jumped up and ran back to the battery, as to the only refuge from the horrors that surrounded him.\n\nOn entering the earthwork he noticed that there were men doing something there but that no shots were being fired from the battery. He had no time to realize who these men were. He saw the senior officer lying on the earth wall with his back turned as if he were examining something down below and that one of the soldiers he had noticed before was struggling forward shouting \u201cBrothers!\u201d and trying to free himself from some men who were holding him by the arm. He also saw something else that was strange.\n\nBut he had not time to realize that the colonel had been killed, that the soldier shouting \u201cBrothers!\u201d was a prisoner, and that another man had been bayoneted in the back before his eyes, for hardly had he run into the redoubt before a thin, sallow-faced, perspiring man in a blue uniform rushed on him sword in hand, shouting something. Instinctively guarding against the shock\u2014for they had been running together at full speed before they saw one another\u2014Pierre put out his hands and seized the man (a French officer) by the shoulder with one hand and by the throat with the other. The officer, dropping his sword, seized Pierre by his collar.\n\nFor some seconds they gazed with frightened eyes at one another\u2019s unfamiliar faces and both were perplexed at what they had done and what they were to do next. \u201cAm I taken prisoner or have I taken him prisoner?\u201d each was thinking. But the French officer was evidently more inclined to think he had been taken prisoner because Pierre\u2019s strong hand, impelled by instinctive fear, squeezed his throat ever tighter and tighter. The Frenchman was about to say something, when just above their heads, terrible and low, a cannon ball whistled, and it seemed to Pierre that the French officer\u2019s head had been torn off, so swiftly had he ducked it.\n\nPierre too bent his head and let his hands fall. Without further thought as to who had taken whom prisoner, the Frenchman ran back to the battery and Pierre ran down the slope stumbling over the dead and wounded who, it seemed to him, caught at his feet. But before he reached the foot of the knoll he was met by a dense crowd of Russian soldiers who, stumbling, tripping up, and shouting, ran merrily and wildly toward the battery. (This was the attack for which Erm\u00f3lov claimed the credit, declaring that only his courage and good luck made such a feat possible: it was the attack in which he was said to have thrown some St. George\u2019s Crosses he had in his pocket into the battery for the first soldiers to take who got there.)\n\nThe French who had occupied the battery fled, and our troops shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d pursued them so far beyond the battery that it was difficult to call them back.\n\nThe prisoners were brought down from the battery and among them was a wounded French general, whom the officers surrounded. Crowds of wounded\u2014some known to Pierre and some unknown\u2014Russians and French, with faces distorted by suffering, walked, crawled, and were carried on stretchers from the battery. Pierre again went up onto the knoll where he had spent over an hour, and of that family circle which had received him as a member he did not find a single one. There were many dead whom he did not know, but some he recognized. The young officer still sat in the same way, bent double, in a pool of blood at the edge of the earth wall. The red-faced man was still twitching, but they did not carry him away.\n\nPierre ran down the slope once more.\n\n\u201cNow they will stop it, now they will be horrified at what they have done!\u201d he thought, aimlessly going toward a crowd of stretcher bearers moving from the battlefield.\n\nBut behind the veil of smoke the sun was still high, and in front and especially to the left, near Sem\u00ebnovsk, something seemed to be seething in the smoke, and the roar of cannon and musketry did not diminish, but even increased to desperation like a man who, straining himself, shrieks with all his remaining strength.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nThe chief action of the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was fought within the seven thousand feet between Borodin\u00f3 and Bagrati\u00f3n\u2019s fl\u00e8ches. Beyond that space there was, on the one side, a demonstration made by the Russians with Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s cavalry at midday, and on the other side, beyond Ut\u00edtsa, Poniatowski\u2019s collision with T\u00fachkov; but these two were detached and feeble actions in comparison with what took place in the center of the battlefield. On the field between Borodin\u00f3 and the fl\u00e8ches, beside the wood, the chief action of the day took place on an open space visible from both sides and was fought in the simplest and most artless way.\n\nThe battle began on both sides with a cannonade from several hundred guns.\n\nThen when the whole field was covered with smoke, two divisions, Campan\u2019s and Dessaix\u2019s, advanced from the French right, while Murat\u2019s troops advanced on Borodin\u00f3 from their left.\n\nFrom the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt where Napoleon was standing the fl\u00e8ches were two thirds of a mile away, and it was more than a mile as the crow flies to Borodin\u00f3, so that Napoleon could not see what was happening there, especially as the smoke mingling with the mist hid the whole locality. The soldiers of Dessaix\u2019s division advancing against the fl\u00e8ches could only be seen till they had entered the hollow that lay between them and the fl\u00e8ches. As soon as they had descended into that hollow, the smoke of the guns and musketry on the fl\u00e8ches grew so dense that it covered the whole approach on that side of it. Through the smoke glimpses could be caught of something black\u2014probably men\u2014and at times the glint of bayonets. But whether they were moving or stationary, whether they were French or Russian, could not be discovered from the Shev\u00e1rdino Redoubt.\n\nThe sun had risen brightly and its slanting rays struck straight into Napoleon\u2019s face as, shading his eyes with his hand, he looked at the fl\u00e8ches. The smoke spread out before them, and at times it looked as if the smoke were moving, at times as if the troops moved. Sometimes shouts were heard through the firing, but it was impossible to tell what was being done there.\n\nNapoleon, standing on the knoll, looked through a field glass, and in its small circlet saw smoke and men, sometimes his own and sometimes Russians, but when he looked again with the naked eye, he could not tell where what he had seen was.\n\nHe descended the knoll and began walking up and down before it.\n\nOccasionally he stopped, listened to the firing, and gazed intently at the battlefield.\n\nBut not only was it impossible to make out what was happening from where he was standing down below, or from the knoll above on which some of his generals had taken their stand, but even from the fl\u00e8ches themselves\u2014in which by this time there were now Russian and now French soldiers, alternately or together, dead, wounded, alive, frightened, or maddened\u2014even at those fl\u00e8ches themselves it was impossible to make out what was taking place. There for several hours amid incessant cannon and musketry fire, now Russians were seen alone, now Frenchmen alone, now infantry, and now cavalry: they appeared, fired, fell, collided, not knowing what to do with one another, screamed, and ran back again.\n\nFrom the battlefield adjutants he had sent out, and orderlies from his marshals, kept galloping up to Napoleon with reports of the progress of the action, but all these reports were false, both because it was impossible in the heat of battle to say what was happening at any given moment and because many of the adjutants did not go to the actual place of conflict but reported what they had heard from others; and also because while an adjutant was riding more than a mile to Napoleon circumstances changed and the news he brought was already becoming false. Thus an adjutant galloped up from Murat with tidings that Borodin\u00f3 had been occupied and the bridge over the Koloch\u00e1 was in the hands of the French. The adjutant asked whether Napoleon wished the troops to cross it? Napoleon gave orders that the troops should form up on the farther side and wait. But before that order was given\u2014almost as soon in fact as the adjutant had left Borodin\u00f3\u2014the bridge had been retaken by the Russians and burned, in the very skirmish at which Pierre had been present at the beginning of the battle.\n\nAn adjutant galloped up from the fl\u00e8ches with a pale and frightened face and reported to Napoleon that their attack had been repulsed, Campan wounded, and Davout killed; yet at the very time the adjutant had been told that the French had been repulsed, the fl\u00e8ches had in fact been recaptured by other French troops, and Davout was alive and only slightly bruised. On the basis of these necessarily untrustworthy reports Napoleon gave his orders, which had either been executed before he gave them or could not be and were not executed.\n\nThe marshals and generals, who were nearer to the field of battle but, like Napoleon, did not take part in the actual fighting and only occasionally went within musket range, made their own arrangements without asking Napoleon and issued orders where and in what direction to fire and where cavalry should gallop and infantry should run. But even their orders, like Napoleon\u2019s, were seldom carried out, and then but partially. For the most part things happened contrary to their orders. Soldiers ordered to advance ran back on meeting grapeshot; soldiers ordered to remain where they were, suddenly, seeing Russians unexpectedly before them, sometimes rushed back and sometimes forward, and the cavalry dashed without orders in pursuit of the flying Russians. In this way two cavalry regiments galloped through the Sem\u00ebnovsk hollow and as soon as they reached the top of the incline turned round and galloped full speed back again. The infantry moved in the same way, sometimes running to quite other places than those they were ordered to go to. All orders as to where and when to move the guns, when to send infantry to shoot or horsemen to ride down the Russian infantry\u2014all such orders were given by the officers on the spot nearest to the units concerned, without asking either Ney, Davout, or Murat, much ", "sequence": 20}, {"offset": 2100000, "text": "less Napoleon. They did not fear getting into trouble for not fulfilling orders or for acting on their own initiative, for in battle what is at stake is what is dearest to man\u2014his own life\u2014and it sometimes seems that safety lies in running back, sometimes in running forward; and these men who were right in the heat of the battle acted according to the mood of the moment. In reality, however, all these movements forward and backward did not improve or alter the position of the troops. All their rushing and galloping at one another did little harm, the harm of disablement and death was caused by the balls and bullets that flew over the fields on which these men were floundering about. As soon as they left the place where the balls and bullets were flying about, their superiors, located in the background, re-formed them and brought them under discipline and under the influence of that discipline led them back to the zone of fire, where under the influence of fear of death they lost their discipline and rushed about according to the chance promptings of the throng.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nNapoleon\u2019s generals\u2014Davout, Ney, and Murat, who were near that region of fire and sometimes even entered it\u2014repeatedly led into it huge masses of well-ordered troops. But contrary to what had always happened in their former battles, instead of the news they expected of the enemy\u2019s flight, these orderly masses returned thence as disorganized and terrified mobs. The generals re-formed them, but their numbers constantly decreased. In the middle of the day Murat sent his adjutant to Napoleon to demand reinforcements.\n\nNapoleon sat at the foot of the knoll, drinking punch, when Murat\u2019s adjutant galloped up with an assurance that the Russians would be routed if His Majesty would let him have another division.\n\n\u201cReinforcements?\u201d said Napoleon in a tone of stern surprise, looking at the adjutant\u2014a handsome lad with long black curls arranged like Murat\u2019s own\u2014as though he did not understand his words.\n\n\u201cReinforcements!\u201d thought Napoleon to himself. \u201cHow can they need reinforcements when they already have half the army directed against a weak, unentrenched Russian wing?\u201d\n\n\u201cTell the King of Naples,\u201d said he sternly, \u201cthat it is not noon yet, and I don\u2019t yet see my chessboard clearly. Go!...\u201d\n\nThe handsome boy adjutant with the long hair sighed deeply without removing his hand from his hat and galloped back to where men were being slaughtered.\n\nNapoleon rose and having summoned Caulaincourt and Berthier began talking to them about matters unconnected with the battle.\n\nIn the midst of this conversation, which was beginning to interest Napoleon, Berthier\u2019s eyes turned to look at a general with a suite, who was galloping toward the knoll on a lathering horse. It was Belliard. Having dismounted he went up to the Emperor with rapid strides and in a loud voice began boldly demonstrating the necessity of sending reinforcements. He swore on his honor that the Russians were lost if the Emperor would give another division.\n\nNapoleon shrugged his shoulders and continued to pace up and down without replying. Belliard began talking loudly and eagerly to the generals of the suite around him.\n\n\u201cYou are very fiery, Belliard,\u201d said Napoleon, when he again came up to the general. \u201cIn the heat of a battle it is easy to make a mistake. Go and have another look and then come back to me.\u201d\n\nBefore Belliard was out of sight, a messenger from another part of the battlefield galloped up.\n\n\u201cNow then, what do you want?\u201d asked Napoleon in the tone of a man irritated at being continually disturbed.\n\n\u201cSire, the prince...\u201d began the adjutant.\n\n\u201cAsks for reinforcements?\u201d said Napoleon with an angry gesture.\n\nThe adjutant bent his head affirmatively and began to report, but the Emperor turned from him, took a couple of steps, stopped, came back, and called Berthier.\n\n\u201cWe must give reserves,\u201d he said, moving his arms slightly apart. \u201cWho do you think should be sent there?\u201d he asked of Berthier (whom he subsequently termed \u201cthat gosling I have made an eagle\u201d).\n\n\u201cSend Clapar\u00e8de\u2019s division, sire,\u201d replied Berthier, who knew all the division\u2019s regiments, and battalions by heart.\n\nNapoleon nodded assent.\n\nThe adjutant galloped to Clapar\u00e8de\u2019s division and a few minutes later the Young Guards stationed behind the knoll moved forward. Napoleon gazed silently in that direction.\n\n\u201cNo!\u201d he suddenly said to Berthier. \u201cI can\u2019t send Clapar\u00e8de. Send Friant\u2019s division.\u201d\n\nThough there was no advantage in sending Friant\u2019s division instead of Clapar\u00e8de\u2019s, and even an obvious inconvenience and delay in stopping Clapar\u00e8de and sending Friant now, the order was carried out exactly. Napoleon did not notice that in regard to his army he was playing the part of a doctor who hinders by his medicines\u2014a role he so justly understood and condemned.\n\nFriant\u2019s division disappeared as the others had done into the smoke of the battlefield. From all sides adjutants continued to arrive at a gallop and as if by agreement all said the same thing. They all asked for reinforcements and all said that the Russians were holding their positions and maintaining a hellish fire under which the French army was melting away.\n\nNapoleon sat on a campstool, wrapped in thought.\n\nM. de Beausset, the man so fond of travel, having fasted since morning, came up to the Emperor and ventured respectfully to suggest lunch to His Majesty.\n\n\u201cI hope I may now congratulate Your Majesty on a victory?\u201d said he.\n\nNapoleon silently shook his head in negation. Assuming the negation to refer only to the victory and not to the lunch, M. de Beausset ventured with respectful jocularity to remark that there is no reason for not having lunch when one can get it.\n\n\u201cGo away...\u201d exclaimed Napoleon suddenly and morosely, and turned aside.\n\nA beatific smile of regret, repentance, and ecstasy beamed on M. de Beausset\u2019s face and he glided away to the other generals.\n\nNapoleon was experiencing a feeling of depression like that of an ever-lucky gambler who, after recklessly flinging money about and always winning, suddenly just when he has calculated all the chances of the game, finds that the more he considers his play the more surely he loses.\n\nHis troops were the same, his generals the same, the same preparations had been made, the same dispositions, and the same proclamation courte et \u00e9nergique, he himself was still the same: he knew that and knew that he was now even more experienced and skillful than before. Even the enemy was the same as at Austerlitz and Friedland\u2014yet the terrible stroke of his arm had supernaturally become impotent.\n\nAll the old methods that had been unfailingly crowned with success: the concentration of batteries on one point, an attack by reserves to break the enemy\u2019s line, and a cavalry attack by \u201cthe men of iron,\u201d all these methods had already been employed, yet not only was there no victory, but from all sides came the same news of generals killed and wounded, of reinforcements needed, of the impossibility of driving back the Russians, and of disorganization among his own troops.\n\nFormerly, after he had given two or three orders and uttered a few phrases, marshals and adjutants had come galloping up with congratulations and happy faces, announcing the trophies taken, the corps of prisoners, bundles of enemy eagles and standards, cannon and stores, and Murat had only begged leave to loose the cavalry to gather in the baggage wagons. So it had been at Lodi, Marengo, Arcola, Jena, Austerlitz, Wagram, and so on. But now something strange was happening to his troops.\n\nDespite news of the capture of the fl\u00e8ches, Napoleon saw that this was not the same, not at all the same, as what had happened in his former battles. He saw that what he was feeling was felt by all the men about him experienced in the art of war. All their faces looked dejected, and they all shunned one another\u2019s eyes\u2014only a de Beausset could fail to grasp the meaning of what was happening.\n\nBut Napoleon with his long experience of war well knew the meaning of a battle not gained by the attacking side in eight hours, after all efforts had been expended. He knew that it was a lost battle and that the least accident might now\u2014with the fight balanced on such a strained center\u2014destroy him and his army.\n\nWhen he ran his mind over the whole of this strange Russian campaign in which not one battle had been won, and in which not a flag, or cannon, or army corps had been captured in two months, when he looked at the concealed depression on the faces around him and heard reports of the Russians still holding their ground\u2014a terrible feeling like a nightmare took possession of him, and all the unlucky accidents that might destroy him occurred to his mind. The Russians might fall on his left wing, might break through his center, he himself might be killed by a stray cannon ball. All this was possible. In former battles he had only considered the possibilities of success, but now innumerable unlucky chances presented themselves, and he expected them all. Yes, it was like a dream in which a man fancies that a ruffian is coming to attack him, and raises his arm to strike that ruffian a terrible blow which he knows should annihilate him, but then feels that his arm drops powerless and limp like a rag, and the horror of unavoidable destruction seizes him in his helplessness.\n\nThe news that the Russians were attacking the left flank of the French army aroused that horror in Napoleon. He sat silently on a campstool below the knoll, with head bowed and elbows on his knees. Berthier approached and suggested that they should ride along the line to ascertain the position of affairs.\n\n\u201cWhat? What do you say?\u201d asked Napoleon. \u201cYes, tell them to bring me my horse.\u201d\n\nHe mounted and rode toward Sem\u00ebnovsk.\n\nAmid the powder smoke, slowly dispersing over the whole space through which Napoleon rode, horses and men were lying in pools of blood, singly or in heaps. Neither Napoleon nor any of his generals had ever before seen such horrors or so many slain in such a small area. The roar of guns, that had not ceased for ten hours, wearied the ear and gave a peculiar significance to the spectacle, as music does to tableaux vivants. Napoleon rode up the high ground at Sem\u00ebnovsk, and through the smoke saw ranks of men in uniforms of a color unfamiliar to him. They were Russians.\n\nThe Russians stood in serried ranks behind Sem\u00ebnovsk village and its knoll, and their guns boomed incessantly along their line and sent forth clouds of smoke. It was no longer a battle: it was a continuous slaughter which could be of no avail either to the French or the Russians. Napoleon stopped his horse and again fell into the reverie from which Berthier had aroused him. He could not stop what was going on before him and around him and was supposed to be directed by him and to depend on him, and from its lack of success this affair, for the first time, seemed to him unnecessary and horrible.\n\nOne of the generals rode up to Napoleon and ventured to offer to lead the Old Guard into action. Ney and Berthier, standing near Napoleon, exchanged looks and smiled contemptuously at this general\u2019s senseless offer.\n\nNapoleon bowed his head and remained silent a long time.\n\n\u201cAt eight hundred leagues from France, I will not have my Guard destroyed!\u201d he said, and turning his horse rode back to Shev\u00e1rdino.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXV\n\nOn the rug-covered bench where Pierre had seen him in the morning sat Kut\u00fazov, his gray head hanging, his heavy body relaxed. He gave no orders, but only assented to or dissented from what others suggested.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, do that,\u201d he replied to various proposals. \u201cYes, yes: go, dear boy, and have a look,\u201d he would say to one or another of those about him; or, \u201cNo, don\u2019t, we\u2019d better wait!\u201d He listened to the reports that were brought him and gave directions when his subordinates demanded that of him; but when listening to the reports it seemed as if he were not interested in the import of the words spoken, but rather in something else\u2014in the expression of face and tone of voice of those who were reporting. By long years of military experience he knew, and with the wisdom of age understood, that it is impossible for one man to direct hundreds of thousands of others struggling with death, and he knew that the result of a battle is decided not by the orders of a commander in chief, nor the place where the troops are stationed, nor by the number of cannon or of slaughtered men, but by that intangible force called the spirit of the army, and he watched this force and guided it in as far as that was in his power.\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s general expression was one of concentrated quiet attention, and his face wore a strained look as if he found it difficult to master the fatigue of his old and feeble body.\n\nAt eleven o\u2019clock they brought him news that the fl\u00e8ches captured by the French had been retaken, but that Prince Bagrati\u00f3n was wounded. Kut\u00fazov groaned and swayed his head.\n\n\u201cRide over to Prince Peter Iv\u00e1novich and find out about it exactly,\u201d he said to one of his adjutants, and then turned to the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg who was standing behind him.\n\n\u201cWill Your Highness please take command of the first army?\u201d\n\nSoon after the duke\u2019s departure\u2014before he could possibly have reached Sem\u00ebnovsk\u2014his adjutant came back from him and told Kut\u00fazov that the duke asked for more troops.\n\nKut\u00fazov made a grimace and sent an order to Dokht\u00farov to take over the command of the first army, and a request to the duke\u2014whom he said he could not spare at such an important moment\u2014to return to him. When they brought him news that Murat had been taken prisoner, and the staff officers congratulated him, Kut\u00fazov smiled.\n\n\u201cWait a little, gentlemen,\u201d said he. \u201cThe battle is won, and there is nothing extraordinary in the capture of Murat. Still, it is better to wait before we rejoice.\u201d\n\nBut he sent an adjutant to take the news round the army.\n\nWhen Scherb\u00ednin came galloping from the left flank with news that the French had captured the fl\u00e8ches and the village of Sem\u00ebnovsk, Kut\u00fazov, guessing by the sounds of the battle and by Scherb\u00ednin\u2019s looks that the news was bad, rose as if to stretch his legs and, taking Scherb\u00ednin\u2019s arm, led him aside.\n\n\u201cGo, my dear fellow,\u201d he said to Erm\u00f3lov, \u201cand see whether something can\u2019t be done.\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov was in G\u00f3rki, near the center of the Russian position. The attack directed by Napoleon against our left flank had been several times repulsed. In the center the French had not got beyond Borodin\u00f3, and on their left flank Uv\u00e1rov\u2019s cavalry had put the French to flight.\n\nToward three o\u2019clock the French attacks ceased. On the faces of all who came from the field of battle, and of those who stood around him, Kut\u00fazov noticed an expression of extreme tension. He was satisfied with the day\u2019s success\u2014a success exceeding his expectations, but the old man\u2019s strength was failing him. Several times his head dropped low as if it were falling and he dozed off. Dinner was brought him.\n\nAdjutant General Wolzogen, the man who when riding past Prince Andrew had said, \u201cthe war should be extended widely,\u201d and whom Bagrati\u00f3n so detested, rode up while Kut\u00fazov was at dinner. Wolzogen had come from Barclay de Tolly to report on the progress of affairs on the left flank. The sagacious Barclay de Tolly, seeing crowds of wounded men running back and the disordered rear of the army, weighed all the circumstances, concluded that the battle was lost, and sent his favorite officer to the commander in chief with that news.\n\nKut\u00fazov was chewing a piece of roast chicken with difficulty and glanced at Wolzogen with eyes that brightened under their puckering lids.\n\nWolzogen, nonchalantly stretching his legs, approached Kut\u00fazov with a half-contemptuous smile on his lips, scarcely touching the peak of his cap.\n\nHe treated his Serene Highness with a somewhat affected nonchalance intended to show that, as a highly trained military man, he left it to Russians to make an idol of this useless old man, but that he knew whom he was dealing with. \u201cDer alte Herr\u201d (as in their own set the Germans called Kut\u00fazov) \u201cis making himself very comfortable,\u201d thought Wolzogen, and looking severely at the dishes in front of Kut\u00fazov he began to report to \u201cthe old gentleman\u201d the position of affairs on the left flank as Barclay had ordered him to and as he himself had seen and understood it.\n\n\u201cAll the points of our position are in the enemy\u2019s hands and we cannot dislodge them for lack of troops, the men are running away and it is impossible to stop them,\u201d he reported.\n\nKut\u00fazov ceased chewing and fixed an astonished gaze on Wolzogen, as if not understanding what was said to him. Wolzogen, noticing \u201cthe old gentleman\u2019s\u201d agitation, said with a smile:\n\n\u201cI have not considered it right to conceal from your Serene Highness what I have seen. The troops are in complete disorder....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou have seen? You have seen?...\u201d Kut\u00fazov shouted. Frowning and rising quickly, he went up to Wolzogen.\n\n\u201cHow... how dare you!...\u201d he shouted, choking and making a threatening gesture with his trembling arms: \u201cHow dare you, sir, say that to me? You know nothing about it. Tell General Barclay from me that his information is incorrect and that the real course of the battle is better known to me, the commander in chief, than to him.\u201d\n\nWolzogen was about to make a rejoinder, but Kut\u00fazov interrupted him.\n\n\u201cThe enemy has been repulsed on the left and defeated on the right flank. If you have seen amiss, sir, do not allow yourself to say what you don\u2019t know! Be so good as to ride to General Barclay and inform him of my firm intention to attack the enemy tomorrow,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov sternly.\n\nAll were silent, and the only sound audible was the heavy breathing of the panting old general.\n\n\u201cThey are repulsed everywhere, for which I thank God and our brave army! The enemy is beaten, and tomorrow we shall drive him from the sacred soil of Russia,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov crossing himself, and he suddenly sobbed as his eyes filled with tears.\n\nWolzogen, shrugging his shoulders and curling his lips, stepped silently aside, marveling at \u201cthe old gentleman\u2019s\u201d conceited stupidity.\n\n\u201cAh, here he is, my hero!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov to a portly, handsome, dark-haired general who was just ascending the knoll.\n\nThis was Ra\u00e9vski, who had spent the whole day at the most important part of the field of Borodin\u00f3.\n\nRa\u00e9vski reported that the troops were firmly holding their ground and that the French no longer ventured to attack.\n\nAfter hearing him, Kut\u00fazov said in French:\n\n\u201cThen you do not think, like some others, that we must retreat?\u201d\n\n\u201cOn the contrary, your Highness, in indecisive actions it is always the most stubborn who remain victors,\u201d replied Ra\u00e9vski, \u201cand in my opinion...\u201d\n\n\u201cKays\u00e1rov!\u201d Kut\u00fazov called to his adjutant. \u201cSit down and write out the order of the day for tomorrow. And you,\u201d he continued, addressing another, \u201cride along the line and announce that tomorrow we attack.\u201d\n\nWhile Kut\u00fazov was talking to Ra\u00e9vski and dictating the order of the day, Wolzogen returned from Barclay and said that General Barclay wished to have written confirmation of the order the field marshal had given.\n\nKut\u00fazov, without looking at Wolzogen, gave directions for the order to be written out which the former commander in chief, to avoid personal responsibility, very judiciously wished to receive.\n\nAnd by means of that mysterious indefinable bond which maintains throughout an army one and the same temper, known as \u201cthe spirit of the army,\u201d and which constitutes the sinew of war, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s words, his order for a battle next day, immediately became known from one end of the army to the other.\n\nIt was far from being the same words or the same order that reached the farthest links of that chain. The tales passing from mouth to mouth at different ends of the army did not even resemble what Kut\u00fazov had said, but the sense of his words spread everywhere because what he said was not the outcome of cunning calculations, but of a feeling that lay in the commander in chief\u2019s soul as in that of every Russian.\n\nAnd on learning that tomorrow they were to attack the enemy, and hearing from the highest quarters a confirmation of what they wanted to believe, the exhausted, wavering men felt comforted and inspirited.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVI\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s regiment was among the reserves which till after one o\u2019clock were stationed inactive behind Sem\u00ebnovsk, under heavy artillery fire. Toward two o\u2019clock the regiment, having already lost more than two hundred men, was moved forward into a trampled oatfield in the gap between Sem\u00ebnovsk and the Knoll Battery, where thousands of men perished that day and on which an intense, concentrated fire from several hundred enemy guns was directed between one and two o\u2019clock.\n\nWithout moving from that spot or firing a single shot the regiment here lost another third of its men. From in front and especially from the right, in the unlifting smoke the guns boomed, and out of the mysterious domain of smoke that overlay the whole space in front, quick hissing cannon balls and slow whistling shells flew unceasingly. At times, as if to allow them a respite, a quarter of an hour passed during which the cannon balls and shells all flew overhead, but sometimes several men were torn from the regiment in a minute and the slain were continually being dragged away and the wounded carried off.\n\nWith each fresh blow less and less chance of life remained for those not yet killed. The regiment stood in columns of battalion, three hundred paces apart, but nevertheless the men were always in one and the same mood. All alike were taciturn and morose. Talk was rarely heard in the ranks, and it ceased altogether every time the thud of a successful shot and the cry of \u201cstretchers!\u201d was heard. Most of the time, by their officers\u2019 order, the men sat on the ground. One, having taken off his shako, carefully loosened the gathers of its lining and drew them tight again; another, rubbing some dry clay between his palms, polished his bayonet; another fingered the strap and pulled the buckle of his bandolier, while another smoothed and refolded his leg bands and put his boots on again. Some built little houses of the tufts in the plowed ground, or plaited baskets from the straw in the cornfield. All seemed fully absorbed in these pursuits. When men were killed or wounded, when rows of stretchers went past, when some troops retreated, and when great masses of the enemy came into view through the smoke, no one paid any attention to these things. But when our artillery or cavalry advanced or some of our infantry were seen to move forward, words of approval were heard on all sides. But the liveliest attention was attracted by occurrences quite apart from, and unconnected with, the battle. It was as if the minds of these morally exhausted men found relief in everyday, commonplace occurrences. A battery of artillery was passing in front of the regiment. The horse of an ammunition cart put its leg over a trace. \u201cHey, look at the trace horse!... Get her leg out! She\u2019ll fall.... Ah, they don\u2019t see it!\u201d came identical shouts from the ranks all along the regiment. Another time, general attention was attracted by a small brown dog, coming heaven knows whence, which trotted in a preoccupied manner in front of the ranks with tail stiffly erect till suddenly a shell fell close by, when it yelped, tucked its tail between its legs, and darted aside. Yells and shrieks of laughter rose from the whole regiment. But such distractions lasted only a moment, and for eight hours the men had been inactive, without food, in constant fear of death, and their pale and gloomy faces grew ever paler and gloomier.\n\nPrince Andrew, pale and gloomy like everyone in the regiment, paced up and down from the border of one patch to another, at the edge of the meadow beside an oatfield, with head bowed and arms behind his back. There was nothing for him to do and no orders to be given. Everything went on of itself. The killed were dragged from the front, the wounded carried away, and the ranks closed up. If any soldiers ran to the rear they returned immediately and hastily. At first Prince Andrew, considering it his duty to rouse the courage of the men and to set them an example, walked about among the ranks, but he soon became convinced that this was unnecessary and that there was nothing he could teach them. All the powers of his soul, as of every soldier there, were unconsciously bent on avoiding the contemplation of the horrors of their situation. He walked along the meadow, dragging his feet, rustling the grass, and gazing at the dust that covered his boots; now he took big strides trying to keep to the footprints left on the meadow by the mowers, then he counted his steps, calculating how often he must walk from one strip to another to walk a mile, then he stripped the flowers from the wormwood that grew along a boundary rut, rubbed them in his palms, and smelled their pungent, sweetly bitter scent. Nothing remained of the previous day\u2019s thoughts. He thought of nothing. He listened with weary ears to the ever-recurring sounds, distinguishing the whistle of flying projectiles from the booming of the reports, glanced at the tiresomely familiar faces of the men of the first battalion, and waited. \u201cHere it comes... this one is coming our way again!\u201d he thought, listening to an approaching whistle in the hidden region of smoke. \u201cOne, another! Again! It has hit....\u201d He stopped and looked at the ranks. \u201cNo, it has gone over. But this one has hit!\u201d And again he started trying to reach the boundary strip in sixteen paces. A whizz and a thud! Five paces from him, a cannon ball tore up the dry earth and disappeared. A chill ran down his back. Again he glanced at the ranks. Probably many had been hit\u2014a large crowd had gathered near the second battalion.\n\n\u201cAdjutant!\u201d he shouted. \u201cOrder them not to crowd together.\u201d\n\nThe adjutant, having obeyed this instruction, approached Prince Andrew. From the other side a battalion commander rode up.\n\n\u201cLook out!\u201d came a frightened cry from a soldier and, like a bird whirring in rapid flight and alighting on the ground, a shell dropped with little noise within two steps of Prince Andrew and close to the battalion commander\u2019s horse. The horse first, regardless of whether it was right or wrong to show fear, snorted, reared almost throwing the major, and galloped aside. The horse\u2019s terror infected the men.\n\n\u201cLie down!\u201d cried the adjutant, throwing himself flat on the ground.\n\nPrince Andrew hesitated. The smoking shell spun like a top between him and the prostrate adjutant, near a wormwood plant between the field and the meadow.\n\n\u201cCan this be death?\u201d thought Prince Andrew, looking with a quite new, envious glance at the grass, the wormwood, and the streamlet of smoke that curled up from the rotating black ball. \u201cI cannot, I do not wish to die. I love life\u2014I love this grass, this earth, this air....\u201d He thought this, and at the same time remembered that people were looking at him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s shameful, sir!\u201d he said to the adjutant. \u201cWhat...\u201d\n\nHe did not finish speaking. At one and the same moment came the sound of an explosion, a whistle of splinters as from a breaking window frame, a suffocating smell of powder, and Prince Andrew started to one side, raising his arm, and fell on his chest. Several officers ran up to him. From the right side of his abdomen, blood was welling out making a large stain on the grass.\n\nThe militiamen with stretchers who were called up stood behind the officers. Prince Andrew lay on his chest with his face in the grass, breathing heavily and noisily.\n\n\u201cWhat are you waiting for? Come along!\u201d\n\nThe peasants went up and took him by his shoulders and legs, but he moaned piteously and, exchanging looks, they set him down again.\n\n\u201cPick him up, lift him, it\u2019s all the same!\u201d cried someone.\n\nThey again took him by the shoulders and laid him on the stretcher.\n\n\u201cAh, God! My God! What is it? The stomach? That means death! My God!\u201d\u2014voices among the officers were heard saying.\n\n\u201cIt flew a hair\u2019s breadth past my ear,\u201d said the adjutant.\n\nThe peasants, adjusting the stretcher to their shoulders, started hurriedly along the path they had trodden down, to the dressing station.\n\n\u201cKeep in step! Ah... those peasants!\u201d shouted an officer, seizing by their shoulders and checking the peasants, who were walking unevenly and jolting the stretcher.\n\n\u201cGet into step, F\u00ebdor... I say, F\u00ebdor!\u201d said the foremost peasant.\n\n\u201cNow that\u2019s right!\u201d said the one behind joyfully, when he had got into step.\n\n\u201cYour excellency! Eh, Prince!\u201d said the trembling voice of Tim\u00f3khin, who had run up and was looking down on the stretcher.\n\nPrince Andrew opened his eyes and looked up at the speaker from the stretcher into which his head had sunk deep and again his eyelids drooped.\n\n\nThe militiamen carried Prince Andrew to the dressing station by the wood, where wagons were stationed. The dressing station consisted of three tents with flaps turned back, pitched at the edge of a birch wood. In the wood, wagons and horses were standing. The horses were eating oats from their movable troughs and sparrows flew down and pecked the grains that fell. Some crows, scenting blood, flew among the birch trees cawing impatiently. Around the tents, over more than five acres, bloodstained men in various garbs stood, sat, or lay. Around the wounded stood crowds of soldier stretcher-bearers with dismal and attentive faces, whom the officers keeping order tried in vain to drive from the spot. Disregarding the officers\u2019 orders, the soldiers stood leaning against their stretchers and gazing intently, as if trying to comprehend the difficult problem of what was taking place before them. From the tents came now loud angry cries and now plaintive groans. Occasionally dressers ran out to fetch water, or to point out those who were to be brought in next. The wounded men awaiting their turn outside the tents groaned, sighed, wept, screamed, swore, or asked for vodka. Some were delirious. Prince Andrew\u2019s bearers, stepping over the wounded who had not yet been bandaged, took him, as a regimental commander, close up to one of the tents and there stopped, awaiting instructions. Prince Andrew opened his eyes and for a long time could not make out what was going on around him. He remembered the meadow, the wormwood, the field, the whirling black ball, and his sudden rush of passionate love of life. Two steps from him, leaning against a branch and talking loudly and attracting general attention, stood a tall, handsome, black-haired noncommissioned officer with a bandaged head. He had been wounded in the head and leg by bullets. Around him, eagerly listening to his talk, a crowd of wounded and stretcher-bearers was gathered.\n\n\u201cWe kicked him out from there so that he chucked everything, we grabbed the King himself!\u201d cried he, looking around him with eyes that glittered with fever. \u201cIf only reserves had come up just then, lads, there wouldn\u2019t have been nothing left of him! I tell you surely....\u201d\n\nLike all the others near the speaker, Prince Andrew looked at him with shining eyes and experienced a sense of comfort. \u201cBut isn\u2019t it all the same now?\u201d thought he. \u201cAnd what will be there, and what has there been here? Why was I so reluctant to part with life? There was something in this life I did not and do not understand.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVII\n\nOne of the doctors came out of the tent in a bloodstained apron, holding a cigar between the thumb and little finger of one of his small bloodstained hands, so as not to smear it. He raised his head and looked about him, but above the level of the wounded men. He evidently wanted a little respite. After turning his head from right to left for some time, he sighed and looked down.\n\n\u201cAll right, immediately,\u201d he replied to a dresser who pointed Prince Andrew out to him, and he told them to carry him into the tent.\n\nMurmurs arose among the wounded who were waiting.\n\n\u201cIt seems that even in the next world only the gentry are to have a chance!\u201d remarked one.\n\nPrince Andrew was carried in and laid on a table that had only just been cleared and which a dresser was washing down. Prince Andrew could not make out distinctly what was in that tent. The pitiful groans from all sides and the torturing pain in his thigh, stomach, and back distracted him. All he saw about him merged into a general impression of naked, bleeding human bodies that seemed to fill the whole of the low tent, as a few weeks previously, on that hot August day, such bodies had filled the dirty pond beside the Smol\u00e9nsk road. Yes, it was the same flesh, the same chair \u00e0 canon, the sight of which had even then filled him with horror, as by a presentiment.\n\nThere were three operating tables in the tent. Two were occupied, and on the third they placed Prince Andrew. For a little while he was left alone and involuntarily witnessed what was taking place on the other two tables. On the nearest one sat a Tartar, probably a Cossack, judging by the uniform thrown down beside him. Four soldiers were holding him, and a spectacled doctor was cutting into his muscular brown back.\n\n\u201cOoh, ooh, ooh!\u201d grunted the Tartar, and suddenly lifting up his swarthy snub-nosed face with its high cheekbones, and baring his white teeth, he began to wriggle and twitch his body and utter piercing, ringing, and prolonged yells. On the other table, round which many people were crowding, a tall well-fed man lay on his back with his head thrown back. His curly hair, its color, and the shape of his head seemed strangely familiar to Prince Andrew. Several dressers were pressing on his chest to hold him down. One large, white, plump leg twitched rapidly all the time with a feverish tremor. The man was sobbing and choking convulsively. Two doctors\u2014one of whom was pale and trembling\u2014were silently doing something to this man\u2019s other, gory leg. When he had finished with the Tartar, whom they covered with an overcoat, the spectacled doctor came up to Prince Andrew, wiping his hands.\n\nHe glanced at Prince Andrew\u2019s face and quickly turned away.\n\n\u201cUndress him! What are you waiting for?\u201d he cried angrily to the dressers.\n\nHis very first, remotest recollections of childhood came back to Prince Andrew\u2019s mind when the dresser with sleeves rolled up began hastily to undo the buttons of his clothes and undressed him. The doctor bent down over the wound, felt it, and sighed deeply. Then he made a sign to someone, and the torturing pain in his abdomen caused Prince Andrew to lose consciousness. When he came to himself the splintered portions of his thighbone had been extracted, the torn flesh cut away, and the wound bandaged. Water was being sprinkled on his face. As soon as Prince Andrew opened his eyes, the doctor bent over, kissed him silently on the lips, and hurried away.\n\nAfter the sufferings he had been enduring, Prince Andrew enjoyed a blissful feeling such as he had not experienced for a long time. All the best and happiest moments of his life\u2014especially his earliest childhood, when he used to be undressed and put to bed, and when leaning over him his nurse sang him to sleep and he, burying his head in the pillow, felt happy in the mere consciousness of life\u2014returned to his memory, not merely as something past but as something present.\n\nThe doctors were busily engaged with the wounded man the shape of whose head seemed familiar to Prince Andrew: they were lifting him up and trying to quiet him.\n\n\u201cShow it to me.... Oh, ooh... Oh! Oh, ooh!\u201d his frightened moans could be heard, subdued by suffering and broken by sobs.\n\nHearing those moans Prince Andrew wanted to weep. Whether because he was dying without glory, or because he was sorry to part with life, or because of those memories of a childhood that could not return, or because he was suffering and others were suffering and that man near him was groaning so piteously\u2014he felt like weeping childlike, kindly, and almost happy tears.\n\nThe wounded man was shown his amputated leg stained with clotted blood and with the boot still on.\n\n\u201cOh! Oh, ooh!\u201d he sobbed, like a woman.\n\nThe doctor who had been standing beside him, preventing Prince Andrew from seeing his face, moved away.\n\n\u201cMy God! What is this? Why is he here?\u201d said Prince Andrew to himself.\n\nIn the miserable, sobbing, enfeebled man whose leg had just been amputated, he recognized Anatole Kur\u00e1gin. Men were supporting him in their arms and offering him a glass of water, but his trembling, swollen lips could not grasp its rim. Anatole was sobbing painfully. \u201cYes, it is he! Yes, that man is somehow closely and painfully connected with me,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, not yet clearly grasping what he saw before him. \u201cWhat is the connection of that man with my childhood and life?\u201d he asked himself without finding an answer. And suddenly a new unexpected memory from that realm of pure and loving childhood presented itself to him. He remembered Nat\u00e1sha as he had seen her for the first time at the ball in 1810, with her slender neck and arms and with a frightened happy face ready for rapture, and love and tenderness for her, stronger and more vivid than ever, awoke in his soul. He now remembered the connection that existed between himself and this man who was dimly gazing at him through tears that filled his swollen eyes. He remembered everything, and ecstatic pity and love for that man overflowed his happy heart.\n\nPrince Andrew could no longer restrain himself and wept tender loving tears for his fellow men, for himself, and for his own and their errors.\n\n\u201cCompassion, love of our brothers, for those who love us and for those who hate us, love of our enemies; yes, that love which God preached on earth and which Princess Mary taught me and I did not understand\u2014that is what made me sorry to part with life, that is what remained for me had I lived. But now it is too late. I know it!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\n\nThe terrible spectacle of the battlefield covered with dead and wounded, together with the heaviness of his head and the news that some twenty generals he knew personally had been killed or wounded, and the consciousness of the impotence of his once mighty arm, produced an unexpected impression on Napoleon who usually liked to look at the killed and wounded, thereby, he considered, testing his strength of mind. This day the horrible appearance of the battlefield overcame that strength of mind which he thought constituted his merit and his greatness. He rode hurriedly from the battlefield and returned to the Shev\u00e1rdino knoll, where he sat on his campstool, his sallow face swollen and heavy, his eyes dim, his nose red, and his voice hoarse, involuntarily listening, with downcast eyes, to the sounds of firing. With painful dejection he awaited the end of this action, in which he regarded himself as a participant and which he was unable to arrest. A personal, human feeling for a brief moment got the better of the artificial phantasm of life he had served so long. He felt in his own person the sufferings and death he had witnessed on the battlefield. The heaviness of his head and chest reminded him of the possibility of suffering and death for himself. At that moment he did not desire Moscow, or victory, or glory (what need had he for any more glory?). The one thing he wished for was rest, tranquillity, and freedom. But when he had been on the Sem\u00ebnovsk heights the artillery commander had proposed to him to bring several batteries of artillery up to those heights to strengthen the fire on the Russian troops crowded in front of Knyazk\u00f3vo. Napoleon had assented and had given orders that news should be brought to him of the effect those batteries produced.\n\nAn adjutant came now to inform him that the fire of two hundred guns had been concentrated on the Russians, as he had ordered, but that they still held their ground.\n\n\u201cOur fire is mowing them down by rows, but still they hold on,\u201d said the adjutant.\n\n\u201cThey want more!...\u201d said Napoleon in a hoarse voice.\n\n\u201cSire?\u201d asked the adjutant who had not heard the remark.\n\n\u201cThey want more!\u201d croaked Napoleon frowning. \u201cLet them have it!\u201d\n\nEven before he gave that order the thing he did not desire, and for which he gave the order only because he thought it was expected of him, was being done. And he fell back into that artificial realm of imaginary greatness, and again\u2014as a horse walking a treadmill thinks it is doing something for itself\u2014he submissively fulfilled the cruel, sad, gloomy, and inhuman role predestined for him.\n\nAnd not for that day and hour alone were the mind and conscience darkened of this man on whom the responsibility for what was happening lay more than on all the others who took part in it. Never to the end of his life could he understand goodness, beauty, or truth, or the significance of his actions which were too contrary to goodness and truth, too remote from everything human, for him ever to be able to grasp their meaning. He could not disavow his actions, belauded as they were by half the world, and so he had to repudiate truth, goodness, and all humanity.\n\nNot only on that day, as he rode over the battlefield strewn with men killed and maimed (by his will as he believed), did he reckon as he looked at them how many Russians there were for each Frenchman and, deceiving himself, find reason for rejoicing in the calculation that there were five Russians for every Frenchman. Not on that day alone did he write in a letter to Paris that \u201cthe battle field was superb,\u201d because fifty thousand corpses lay there, but even on the island of St. Helena in the peaceful solitude where he said he intended to devote his leisure to an account of the great deeds he had done, he wrote:\n\nThe Russian war should have been the most popular war of modern times: it was a war of good sense, for real interests, for the tranquillity and security of all; it was purely pacific and conservative.\n\nIt was a war for a great cause, the end of uncertainties and the beginning of security. A new horizon and new labors were opening out, full of well-being and prosperity for all. The European system was already founded; all that remained was to organize it.\n\nSatisfied on these great points and with tranquility everywhere, I too should have had my Congress and my Holy Alliance. Those ideas were stolen from me. In that reunion of great sovereigns we should have discussed our interests like one family, and have rendered account to the peoples as clerk to master.\n\nEurope would in this way soon have been, in fact, but one people, and anyone who traveled anywhere would have found himself always in the common fatherland. I should have demanded the freedom of all navigable rivers for everybody, that the seas should be common to all, and that the great standing armies should be reduced henceforth to mere guards for the sovereigns.\n\nOn returning to France, to the bosom of the great, strong, magnificent, peaceful, and glorious fatherland, I should have proclaimed her frontiers immutable; all future wars purely defensive, all aggrandizement antinational. I should have associated my son in the Empire; my dictatorship would have been finished, and his constitutional reign would have begun.\n\nParis would have been the capital of the world, and the French the envy of the nations!\n\nMy leisure then, and my old age, would have been devoted, in company with the Empress and during the royal apprenticeship of my son, to leisurely visiting, with our own horses and like a true country couple, every corner of the Empire, receiving complaints, redressing wrongs, and scattering public buildings and benefactions on all sides and everywhere.\n\nNapoleon, predestined by Providence for the gloomy role of executioner of the peoples, assured himself that the aim of his actions had been the peoples\u2019 welfare and that he could control the fate of millions and by the employment of power confer benefactions.\n\n\u201cOf four hundred thousand who crossed the Vistula,\u201d he wrote further of the Russian war, \u201chalf were Austrians, Prussians, Saxons, Poles, Bavarians, W\u00fcrttembergers, Mecklenburgers, Spaniards, Italians, and Neapolitans. The Imperial army, strictly speaking, was one third composed of Dutch, Belgians, men from the borders of the Rhine, Piedmontese, Swiss, Genevese, Tuscans, Romans, inhabitants of the Thirty-second Military Division, of Bremen, of Hamburg, and so on: it included scarcely a hundred and forty thousand who spoke French. The Russian expedition actually cost France less than fifty thousand men; the Russian army in its retreat from V\u00edlna to Moscow lost in the various battles four times more men than the French army; the burning of Moscow cost the lives of a hundred thousand Russians who died of cold and want in the woods; finally, in its march from Moscow to the Oder the Russian army also suffered from the severity of the season; so that by the time it reached V\u00edlna it numbered only fifty thousand, and at K\u00e1lisch less than eighteen thousand.\u201d\n\nHe imagined that the war with Russia came about by his will, and the horrors that occurred did not stagger his soul. He boldly took the whole responsibility for what happened, and his darkened mind found justification in the belief that among the hundreds of thousands who perished there were fewer Frenchmen than Hessians and Bavarians.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIX\n\nSeveral tens of thousands of the slain lay in diverse postures and various uniforms on the fields and meadows belonging to the Dav\u00fddov family and to the crown serfs\u2014those fields and meadows where for hundreds of years the peasants of Borodin\u00f3, G\u00f3rki, Shev\u00e1rdino, and Sem\u00ebnovsk had reaped their harvests and pastured their cattle. At the dressing stations the grass and earth were soaked with blood for a space of some three acres around. Crowds of men of various arms, wounded and unwounded, with frightened faces, dragged themselves back to Mozh\u00e1ysk from the one army and back to Val\u00faevo from the other. Other crowds, exhausted and hungry, went forward led by their officers. Others held their ground and continued to fire.\n\nOver the whole field, previously so gaily beautiful with the glitter of bayonets and cloudlets of smoke in the morning sun, there now spread a mist of damp and smoke and a strange acid smell of saltpeter and blood. Clouds gathered and drops of rain began to fall on the dead and wounded, on the frightened, exhausted, and hesitating men, as if to say: \u201cEnough, men! Enough! Cease... bethink yourselves! What are you doing?\u201d\n\nTo the men of both sides alike, worn out by want of food and rest, it began equally to appear doubtful whether they should continue to slaughter one another; all the faces expressed hesitation, and the question arose in every soul: \u201cFor what, for whom, must I kill and be killed?... You may go and kill whom you please, but I don\u2019t want to do so any more!\u201d By evening this thought had ripened in every soul. At any moment these men might have been seized with horror at what they were doing and might have thrown up everything and run away anywhere.\n\nBut though toward the end of the battle the men felt all the horror of what they were doing, though they would have been glad to leave off, some incomprehensible, mysterious power continued to control them, and they still brought up the charges, loaded, aimed, and applied the match, though only one artilleryman survived out of every three, and though they stumbled and panted with fatigue, perspiring and stained with blood and powder. The cannon balls flew just as swiftly and cruelly from both sides, crushing human bodies, and that terrible work which was not done by the will of a man but at the will of Him who governs men and worlds continued.\n\nAnyone looking at the disorganized rear of the Russian army would have said that, if only the French made one more slight effort, it would disappear; and anyone looking at the rear of the French army would have said that the Russians need only make one more slight effort and the French would be destroyed. But neither the French nor the Russians made that effort, and the flame of battle burned slowly out.\n\nThe Russians did not make that effort because they were not attacking the French. At the beginning of the battle they stood blocking the way to Moscow and they still did so at the end of the battle as at the beginning. But even had the aim of the Russians been to drive the French from their positions, they could not have made this last effort, for all the Russian troops had been broken up, there was no part of the Russian army that had not suffered in the battle, and though still holding their positions they had lost ONE HALF of their army.\n\nThe French, with the memory of all their former victories during fifteen years, with the assurance of Napoleon\u2019s invincibility, with the consciousness that they had captured part of the battlefield and had lost only a quarter of their men and still had their Guards intact, twenty thousand strong, might easily have made that effort. The French who had attacked the Russian army in order to drive it from its position ought to have made that effort, for as long as the Russians continued to block the road to Moscow as before, the aim of the French had not been attained and all their efforts and losses were in vain. But the French did not make that effort. Some historians say that Napoleon need only have used his Old Guards, who were intact, and the battle would have been won. To speak of what would have happened had Napoleon sent his Guards is like talking of what would happen if autumn became spring. It could not be. Napoleon did not give his Guards, not because he did not want to, but because it could not be done. All the generals, officers, and soldiers of the French army knew it could not be done, because the flagging spirit of the troops would not permit it.\n\nIt was not Napoleon alone who had experienced that nightmare feeling of the mighty arm being stricken powerless, but all the generals and soldiers of his army whether they had taken part in the battle or not, after all their experience of previous battles\u2014when after one tenth of such efforts the enemy had fled\u2014experienced a similar feeling of terror before an enemy who, after losing HALF his men, stood as threateningly at the end as at the beginning of the battle. The moral force of the attacking French army was exhausted. Not that sort of victory which is defined by the capture of pieces of material fastened to sticks, called standards, and of the ground on which the troops had stood and were standing, but a moral victory that convinces the enemy of the moral superiority of his opponent and of his own impotence was gained by the Russians at Borodin\u00f3. The French invaders, like an infuriated animal that has in its onslaught received a mortal wound, felt that they were perishing, but could not stop, any more than the Russian army, weaker by one half, could help swerving. By impetus gained, the French army was still able to roll forward to Moscow, but there, without further effort on the part of the Russians, it had to perish, bleeding from the mortal wound it had received at Borodin\u00f3. The direct consequence of the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was Napoleon\u2019s senseless flight from Moscow, his retreat along the old Smol\u00e9nsk road, the destruction of the invading army of five hundred thousand men, and the downfall of Napoleonic France, on which at Borodin\u00f3 for the first time the hand of an opponent of stronger spirit had been laid.\n\n\n\nBOOK ELEVEN: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nAbsolute continuity of motion is not comprehensible to the human mind. Laws of motion of any kind become comprehensible to man only when he examines arbitrarily selected elements of that motion; but at the same time, a large proportion of human error comes from the arbitrary division of continuous motion into discontinuous elements. There is a well-known, so-called sophism of the ancients consisting in this, that Achilles could never catch up with a tortoise he was following, in spite of the fact that he traveled ten times as fast as the tortoise. By the time Achilles has covered the distance that separated him from the tortoise, the tortoise has covered one tenth of that distance ahead of him: when Achilles has covered that tenth, the tortoise has covered another one hundredth, and so on forever. This problem seemed to the ancients insoluble. The absurd answer (that Achilles could never overtake the tortoise) resulted from this: that motion was arbitrarily divided into discontinuous elements, whereas the motion both of Achilles and of the tortoise was continuous.\n\nBy adopting smaller and smaller elements of motion we only approach a solution of the problem, but never reach it. Only when we have admitted the conception of the infinitely small, and the resulting geometrical progression with a common ratio of one tenth, and have found the sum of this progression to infinity, do we reach a solution of the problem.\n\nA modern branch of mathematics having achieved the art of dealing with the infinitely small can now yield solutions in other more complex problems of motion which used to appear insoluble.\n\nThis modern branch of mathematics, unknown to the ancients, when dealing with problems of motion admits the conception of the infinitely small, and so conforms to the chief condition of motion (absolute continuity) and thereby corrects the inevitable error which the human mind cannot avoid when it deals with separate elements of motion instead of examining continuous motion.\n\nIn seeking the laws of historical movement just the same thing happens. The movement of humanity, arising as it does from innumerable arbitrary human wills, is continuous.\n\nTo understand the laws of this continuous movement is the aim of history. But to arrive at these laws, resulting from the sum of all those human wills, man\u2019s mind postulates arbitrary and disconnected units. The first method of history is to take an arbitrarily selected series of continuous events and examine it apart from others, though there is and can be no beginning to any event, for one event always flows uninterruptedly from another.\n\nThe second method is to consider the actions of some one man\u2014a king or a commander\u2014as equivalent to the sum of many individual wills; whereas the sum of individual wills is never expressed by the activity of a single historic personage.\n\nHistorical science in its endeavor to draw nearer to truth continually takes smaller and smaller units for examination. But however small the units it takes, we feel that to take any unit disconnected from others, or to assume a beginning of any phenomenon, or to say that the will of many men is expressed by the actions of any one historic personage, is in itself false.\n\nIt needs no critical exertion to reduce utterly to dust any deductions drawn from history. It is merely necessary to select some larger or smaller unit as the subject of observation\u2014as criticism has every right to do, seeing that whatever unit history observes must always be arbitrarily selected.\n\nOnly by taking infinitesimally small units for observation (the differential of history, that is, the individual tendencies of men) and attaining to the art of integrating them (that is, finding the sum of these infinitesimals) can we hope to arrive at the laws of history.\n\nThe first fifteen years of the nineteenth century in Europe present an extraordinary movement of millions of people. Men leave their customary pursuits, hasten from one side of Europe to the other, plunder and slaughter one another, triumph and are plunged in despair, and for some years the whole course of life is altered and presents an intensive movement which first increases and then slackens. What was the cause of this movement, by what laws was it governed? asks the mind of man.\n\nThe historians, replying to this question, lay before us the sayings and doings of a few dozen men in a building in the city of Paris, calling these sayings and doings \u201cthe Revolution\u201d; then they give a detailed biography of Napoleon and of certain people favorable or hostile to him; tell of the influence some of these people had on others, and say: that is why this movement took place and those are its laws.\n\nBut the mind of man not only refuses to believe this explanation, but plainly says that this method of explanation is fallacious, because in it a weaker phenomenon is taken as the cause of a stronger. The sum of human wills produced the Revolution and Napoleon, and only the sum of those wills first tolerated and then destroyed them.\n\n\u201cBut every time there have been conquests there have been conquerors; every time there has been a revolution in any state there have been great men,\u201d says history. And, indeed, human reason replies: every time conquerors appear there have been wars, but this does not prove that the conquerors caused the wars and that it is possible to find the laws of a war in the personal activity of a single man. Whenever I look at my watch and its hands point to ten, I hear the bells of the neighboring church; but because the bells begin to ring when the hands of the clock reach ten, I have no right to assume that the movement of the bells is caused by the position of the hands of the watch.\n\nWhenever I see the movement of a locomotive I hear the whistle and see the valves opening and wheels turning; but I have no right to conclude that the whistling and the turning of wheels are the cause of the movement of the engine.\n\nThe peasants say that a cold wind blows in late spring because the oaks are budding, and really every spring cold winds do blow when the oak is budding. But though I do not know what causes the cold winds to blow when the oak buds unfold, I cannot agree with the peasants that the unfolding of the oak buds is the cause of the cold wind, for the force of the wind is beyond the influence of the buds. I see only a coincidence of occurrences such as happens with all the phenomena of life, and I see that however much and however carefully I observe the hands of the watch, and the valves and wheels of the engine, and the oak, I shall not discover the cause of the bells ringing, the engine moving, or of the winds of spring. To that I must entirely change my point of view and study the laws of the movement of steam, of the bells, and of the wind. History must do the same. And attempts in this direction have already been made.\n\nTo study the laws of history we must completely change the subject of our observation, must leave aside kings, ministers, and generals, and study the common, infinitesimally small elements by which the masses are moved. No one can say in how far it is possible for man to advance in this way toward an understanding of the laws of history; but it is evident that only along that path does the possibility of discovering the laws of history lie, and that as yet not a millionth part as much mental effort has been applied in this direction by historians as has been devoted to describing the actions of various kings, commanders, and ministers and propounding the historians\u2019 own reflections concerning these actions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe forces of a dozen European nations burst into Russia. The Russian army and people avoided a collision till Smol\u00e9nsk was reached, and again from Smol\u00e9nsk to Borodin\u00f3. The French army pushed on to Moscow, its goal, its impetus ever increasing as it neared its aim, just as the velocity of a falling body increases as it approaches the earth. Behind it were seven hundred miles of hunger-stricken, hostile country; ahead were a few dozen miles separating it from its goal. Every soldier in Napoleon\u2019s army felt this and the invasion moved on by its own momentum.\n\nThe more the Russian army retreated the more fiercely a spirit of hatred of the enemy flared up, and while it retreated the army increased and consolidated. At Borodin\u00f3 a collision took place. Neither army was broken up, but the Russian army retreated immediately after the collision as inevitably as a ball recoils after colliding with another having a greater momentum, and with equal inevitability the ball of invasion that had advanced with such momentum rolled on for some distance, though the collision had deprived it of all its force.\n\nThe Russians retreated eighty miles\u2014to beyond Moscow\u2014and the French reached Moscow and there came to a standstill. For five weeks after that there was not a single battle. The French did not move. As a bleeding, mortally wounded animal licks its wounds, they remained inert in Moscow for five weeks, and then suddenly, with no fresh reason, fled back: they made a dash for the Kal\u00faga road, and (after a victory\u2014for at M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets the field of conflict again remained theirs) without undertaking a single serious battle, they fled still more rapidly back to Smol\u00e9nsk, beyond Smol\u00e9nsk, beyond the Ber\u00ebzina, beyond V\u00edlna, and farther still.\n\nOn the evening of the twenty-sixth of August, Kut\u00fazov and the whole Russian army were convinced that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was a victory. Kut\u00fazov reported so to the Emperor. He gave orders to prepare for a fresh conflict to finish the enemy and did this not to deceive anyone, but because he knew that the enemy was beaten, as everyone who had taken part in the battle knew it.\n\nBut all that evening and next day reports came in one after another of unheard-of losses, of the loss of half the army, and a fresh battle proved physically impossible.\n\nIt was impossible to give battle before information had been collected, the wounded gathered in, the supplies of ammunition replenished, the slain reckoned up, new officers appointed to replace those who had been killed, and before the men had had food and sleep. And meanwhile, the very next morning after the battle, the French army advanced of itself upon the Russians, carried forward by the force of its own momentum now seemingly increased in inverse proportion to the square of the distance from its aim. Kut\u00fazov\u2019s wish was to attack next day, and the whole army desired to do so. But to make an attack the wish to do so is not sufficient, there must also be a possibility of doing it, and that possibility did not exist. It was impossible not to retreat a day\u2019s march, and then in the same way it was impossible not to retreat another and a third day\u2019s march, and at last, on the first of September when the army drew near Moscow\u2014despite the strength of the feeling that had arisen in all ranks\u2014the force of circumstances compelled it to retire beyond Moscow. And the troops retired one more, last, day\u2019s march, and abandoned Moscow to the enemy.\n\nFor people accustomed to think that plans of campaign and battles are made by generals\u2014as anyone of us sitting over a map in his study may imagine how he would have arranged things in this or that battle\u2014the questions present themselves: Why did Kut\u00fazov during the retreat not do this or that? Why did he not take up a position before reaching Fil\u00ed? Why did he not retire at once by the Kal\u00faga road, abandoning Moscow? and so on. People accustomed to think in that way forget, or do not know, the inevitable conditions which always limit the activities of any commander in chief. The activity of a commander in chief does not at all resemble the activity we imagine to ourselves when we sit at ease in our studies examining some campaign on the map, with a certain number of troops on this and that side in a certain known locality, and begin our plans from some given moment. A commander in chief is never dealing with the beginning of any event\u2014the position from which we always contemplate it. The commander in chief is always in the midst of a series of shifting events and so he never can at any moment consider the whole import of an event that is occurring. Moment by moment the event is imperceptibly shaping itself, and at every moment of this continuous, uninterrupted shaping of events the commander in chief is in the midst of a most complex play of intrigues, worries, contingencies, authorities, projects, counsels, threats, and deceptions and is continually obliged to reply to innumerable questions addressed to him, which constantly conflict with one another.\n\nLearned military authorities quite seriously tell us that Kut\u00fazov should have moved his army to the Kal\u00faga road long before reaching Fil\u00ed, and that somebody actually submitted such a proposal to him. But a commander in chief, especially at a difficult moment, has always before him not one proposal but dozens simultaneously. And all these proposals, based on strategics and tactics, contradict each other.\n\nA commander in chief\u2019s business, it would seem, is simply to choose one of these projects. But even that he cannot do. Events and time do not wait. For instance, on the twenty-eighth it is suggested to him to cross to the Kal\u00faga road, but just then an adjutant gallops up from Milor\u00e1dovich asking whether he is to engage the French or retire. An order must be given him at once, that instant. And the order to retreat carries us past the turn to the Kal\u00faga road. And after the adjutant comes the commissary general asking where the stores are to be taken, and the chief of the hospitals asks where the wounded are to go, and a courier from Petersburg brings a letter from the sovereign which does not admit of the possibility of abandoning Moscow, and the commander in chief\u2019s rival, the man who is undermining him (and there are always not merely one but several such), presents a new project diametrically opposed to that of turning to the Kal\u00faga road, and the commander in chief himself needs sleep and refreshment to maintain his energy and a respectable general who has been overlooked in the distribution of rewards comes to complain, and the inhabitants of the district pray to be defended, and an officer sent to inspect the locality comes in and gives a report quite contrary to what was said by the officer previously sent; and a spy, a prisoner, and a general who has been on reconnaissance, all describe the position of the enemy\u2019s army differently. People accustomed to misunderstand or to forget these inevitable conditions of a commander in chief\u2019s actions describe to us, for instance, the position of the army at Fil\u00ed and assume that the commander in chief could, on the first of September, quite freely decide whether to abandon Moscow or defend it; whereas, with the Russian army less than four miles from Moscow, no such question existed. When had that question been settled? At Drissa and at Smol\u00e9nsk and most palpably of all on the twenty-fourth of August at Shev\u00e1rdino and on the twenty-sixth at Borodin\u00f3, and each day and hour and minute of the retreat from Borodin\u00f3 to Fil\u00ed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nWhen Erm\u00f3lov, having been sent by Kut\u00fazov to inspect the position, told the field marshal that it was impossible to fight there before Moscow and that they must retreat, Kut\u00fazov looked at him in silence.\n\n\u201cGive me your hand,\u201d said he and, turning it over so as to feel the pulse, added: \u201cYou are not well, my dear fellow. Think what you are saying!\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov could not yet admit the possibility of retreating beyond Moscow without a battle.\n\nOn the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill, four miles from the Dorogom\u00edlov gate of Moscow, Kut\u00fazov got out of his carriage and sat down on a bench by the roadside. A great crowd of generals gathered round him, and Count Rostopch\u00edn, who had come out from Moscow, joined them. This brilliant company separated into several groups who all discussed the advantages and disadvantages of the position, the state of the army, the plans suggested, the situation of Moscow, and military questions generally. Though they had not been summoned for the purpose, and though it was not so called, they all felt that this was really a council of war. The conversations all dealt with public questions. If anyone gave or asked for personal news, it was done in a whisper and they immediately reverted to general matters. No jokes, or laughter, or smiles even, were seen among all these men. They evidently all made an effort to hold themselves at the height the situation demanded. And all these groups, while talking among themselves, tried to keep near the commander in chief (whose bench formed the center of the gathering) and to speak so that he might overhear them. The commander in chief listened to what was being said and sometimes asked them to repeat their remarks, but did not himself take part in the conversations or express any opinion. After hearing what was being said by one or other of these groups he generally turned away with an air of disappointment, as though they were not speaking of anything he wished to hear. Some discussed the position that had been chosen, criticizing not the position itself so much as the mental capacity of those who had chosen it. Others argued that a mistake had been made earlier and that a battle should have been fought two days before. Others again spoke of the battle of Salamanca, which was described by Crosart, a newly arrived Frenchman in a Spanish uniform. (This Frenchman and one of the German princes serving with the Russian army were discussing the siege of Saragossa and considering the possibility of defending Moscow in a similar manner.) Count Rostopch\u00edn was telling a fourth group that he was prepared to die with the city train bands under the walls of the capital, but that he still could not help regretting having been left in ignorance of what was happening, and that had he known it sooner things would have been different.... A fifth group, displaying the profundity of their strategic perceptions, discussed the direction the troops would now have to take. A sixth group was talking absolute nonsense. Kut\u00fazov\u2019s expression grew more and more preoccupied and gloomy. From all this talk he saw only one thing: that to defend Moscow was a physical impossibility in the full meaning of those words, that is to say, so utterly impossible that if any senseless commander were to give orders to fight, confusion would result but the battle would still not take place. It would not take place because the commanders not merely all recognized the position to be impossible, but in their conversations were only discussing what would happen after its inevitable abandonment. How could the commanders lead their troops to a field of battle they considered impossible to hold? The lower-grade officers and even the soldiers (who too reason) also considered the position impossible and therefore could not go to fight, fully convinced as they were of defeat. If Bennigsen insisted on the position being defended and others still discussed it, the question was no longer important in itself but only as a pretext for disputes and intrigue. This Kut\u00fazov knew well.\n\nBennigsen, who had chosen the position, warmly displayed his Russian patriotism (Kut\u00fazov could not listen to this without wincing) by insisting that Moscow must be defended. His aim was as clear as daylight to Kut\u00fazov: if the defense failed, to throw the blame on Kut\u00fazov who had brought the army as far as the Sparrow Hills without giving battle; if it succeeded, to claim the success as his own; or if battle were not given, to clear himself of the crime of abandoning Moscow. But this intrigue did not now occupy the old man\u2019s mind. One terrible question absorbed him and to that question he heard no reply from anyone. The question for him now was: \u201cHave I really allowed Napoleon to reach Moscow, and when did I do so? When was it decided? Can it have been yesterday when I ordered Pl\u00e1tov to retreat, or was it the evening before, when I had a nap and told Bennigsen to issue orders? Or was it earlier still?... When, when was this terrible affair decided? Moscow must be abandoned. The army must retreat and the order to do so must be given.\u201d To give that terrible order seemed to him equivalent to resigning the command of the army. And not only did he love power to which he was accustomed (the honours awarded to Prince Prozor\u00f3vski, under whom he had served in Turkey, galled him), but he was convinced that he was destined to save Russia and that that was why, against the Emperor\u2019s wish and by the will of the people, he had been chosen commander in chief. He was convinced that he alone could maintain command of the army in these difficult circumstances, and that in all the world he alone could encounter the invincible Napoleon without fear, and he was horrified at the thought of the order he had to issue. But something had to be decided, and these conversations around him which were assuming too free a character must be stopped.\n\nHe called the most important generals to him.\n\n\u201cMy head, be it good or bad, must depend on itself,\u201d said he, rising from the bench, and he rode to Fil\u00ed where his carriages were waiting.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe Council of War began to assemble at two in the afternoon in the better and roomier part of Andrew Savosty\u00e1nov\u2019s hut. The men, women, and children of the large peasant family crowded into the back room across the passage. Only Mal\u00e1sha, Andrew\u2019s six-year-old granddaughter whom his Serene Highness had petted and to whom he had given a lump of sugar while drinking his tea, remained on the top of the brick oven in the larger room. Mal\u00e1sha looked down from the oven with shy delight at the faces, uniforms, and decorations of the generals, who one after another came into the room and sat down on the broad benches in the corner under the icons. \u201cGranddad\u201d himself, as Mal\u00e1sha in her own mind called Kut\u00fazov, sat apart in a dark corner behind the oven. He sat, sunk deep in a folding armchair, and continually cleared his throat and pulled at the collar of his coat which, though it was unbuttoned, still seemed to pinch his neck. Those who entered went up one by one to the field marshal; he pressed the hands of some and nodded to others. His adjutant Kays\u00e1rov was about to draw back the curtain of the window facing Kut\u00fazov, but the latter moved his hand angrily and Kays\u00e1rov understood that his Serene Highness did not wish his face to be seen.\n\nRound the peasant\u2019s deal table, on which lay maps, plans, pencils, and papers, so many people gathered that the orderlies brought in another bench and put it beside the table. Erm\u00f3lov, Kays\u00e1rov, and Toll, who had just arrived, sat down on this bench. In the foremost place, immediately under the icons, sat Barclay de Tolly, his high forehead merging into his bald crown. He had a St. George\u2019s Cross round his neck and looked pale and ill. He had been feverish for two days and was now shivering and in pain. Beside him sat Uv\u00e1rov, who with rapid gesticulations was giving him some information, speaking in low tones as they all did. Chubby little Dokht\u00farov was listening attentively with eyebrows raised and arms folded on his stomach. On the other side sat Count Ostermann-Tolst\u00f3y, seemingly absorbed in his own thoughts. His broad head with its bold features and glittering eyes was resting on his hand. Ra\u00e9vski, twitching forward the black hair on his temples as was his habit, glanced now at Kut\u00fazov and now at the door with a look of impatience. Konovn\u00edtsyn\u2019s firm, handsome, and kindly face was lit up by a tender, sly smile. His glance met Mal\u00e1sha\u2019s, and the expression of his eyes caused the little girl to smile.\n\nThey were all waiting for Bennigsen, who on the pretext of inspecting the position was finishing his savory dinner. They waited for him from four till six o\u2019clock and did not begin their deliberations all that time but talked in low tones of other matters.\n\nOnly when Bennigsen had entered the hut did Kut\u00fazov leave his corner and draw toward the table, but not near enough for the candles that had been placed there to light up his face.\n\nBennigsen opened the council with the question: \u201cAre we to abandon Russia\u2019s ancient and sacred capital without a struggle, or are we to defend it?\u201d A prolonged and general silence followed. There was a frown on every face and only Kut\u00fazov\u2019s angry grunts and occasional cough broke the silence. All eyes were gazing at him. Mal\u00e1sha too looked at \u201cGranddad.\u201d She was nearest to him and saw how his face puckered; he seemed about to cry, but this did not last long.\n\n\u201cRussia\u2019s ancient and sacred capital!\u201d he suddenly said, repeating Bennigsen\u2019s words in an angry voice and thereby drawing attention to the false note in them. \u201cAllow me to tell you, your excellency, that that question has no meaning for a Russian.\u201d (He lurched his heavy body forward.) \u201cSuch a question cannot be put; it is senseless! The question I have asked these gentlemen to meet to discuss is a military one. The question is that of saving Russia. Is it better to give up Moscow without a battle, or by accepting battle to risk losing the army as well as Moscow? That is the question on which I want your opinion,\u201d and he sank back in his chair.\n\nThe discussion began. Bennigsen did not yet consider his game lost. Admitting the view of Barclay and others that a defensive battle at Fil\u00ed was impossible, but imbued with Russian patriotism and the love of Moscow, he proposed to move troops from the right to the left flank during the night and attack the French right flank the following day. Opinions were divided, and arguments were advanced for and against that project. Erm\u00f3lov, Dokht\u00farov, and Ra\u00e9vski agreed with Bennigsen. Whether feeling it necessary to make a sacrifice before abandoning the capital or guided by other, personal considerations, these generals seemed not to understand that this council could not alter the inevitable course of events and that Moscow was in effect already abandoned. The other generals, however, understood it and, leaving aside the question of Moscow, spoke of the direction the army should take in its retreat. Mal\u00e1sha, who kept her eyes fixed on what was going on before her, understood the meaning of the council differently. It seemed to her that it was only a personal struggle between \u201cGranddad\u201d and \u201cLong-coat\u201d as she termed Bennigsen. She saw that they grew spiteful when they spoke to one another, and in her heart she sided with \u201cGranddad.\u201d In the midst of the conversation she noticed \u201cGranddad\u201d give Bennigsen a quick, subtle glance, and then to her joys she saw that \u201cGranddad\u201d said something to \u201cLong-coat\u201d which settled him. Bennigsen suddenly reddened and paced angrily up and down the room. What so affected him was Kut\u00fazov\u2019s calm and quiet comment on the advantage or disadvantage of Bennigsen\u2019s proposal to move troops by night from the right to the left flank to attack the French right wing.\n\n\u201cGentlemen,\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, \u201cI cannot approve of the count\u2019s plan. Moving troops in close proximity to an enemy is always dangerous, and military history supports that view. For instance...\u201d Kut\u00fazov seemed to reflect, searching for an example, then with a clear, na\u00efve look at Bennigsen he added: \u201cOh yes; take the battle of Friedland, which I think the count well remembers, and which was... not fully successful, only because our troops were rearranged too near the enemy....\u201d\n\nThere followed a momentary pause, which seemed very long to them all.\n\nThe discussion recommenced, but pauses frequently occurred and they all felt that there was no more to be said.\n\nDuring one of these pauses Kut\u00fazov heaved a deep sigh as if preparing to speak. They all looked at him.\n\n\u201cWell, gentlemen, I see that it is I who will have to pay for the broken crockery,\u201d said he, and rising slowly he moved to the table. \u201cGentlemen, I have heard your views. Some of you will not agree with me. But I,\u201d he paused, \u201cby the authority entrusted to me by my Sovereign and country, order a retreat.\u201d\n\nAfter that the generals began to disperse with the solemnity and circumspect silence of people who are leaving, after a funeral.\n\nSome of the generals, in low tones and in a strain very different from the way they had spoken during the council, communicated something to their commander in chief.\n\nMal\u00e1sha, who had long been expected for supper, climbed carefully backwards down from the oven, her bare little feet catching at its projections, and slipping between the legs of the generals she darted out of the room.\n\nWhen he had dismissed the generals Kut\u00fazov sat a long time with his elbows on the table, thinking always of the same terrible question: \u201cWhen, when did the abandonment of Moscow become inevitable? When was that done which settled the matter? And who was to blame for it?\u201d\n\n\u201cI did not expect this,\u201d said he to his adjutant Schneider when the latter came in late that night. \u201cI did not expect this! I did not think this would happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should take some rest, your Serene Highness,\u201d replied Schneider.\n\n\u201cBut no! They shall eat horseflesh yet, like the Turks!\u201d exclaimed Kut\u00fazov without replying, striking the table with his podgy fist. \u201cThey shall too, if only...\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nAt that very time, in circumstances even more important than retreating without a battle, namely the evacuation and burning of Moscow, Rostopch\u00edn, who is usually represented as being the instigator of that event, acted in an altogether different manner from Kut\u00fazov.\n\nAfter the battle of Borodin\u00f3 the abandonment and burning of Moscow was as inevitable as the retreat of the army beyond Moscow without fighting.\n\nEvery Russian might have predicted it, not by reasoning but by the feeling implanted in each of us and in our fathers.\n\nThe same thing that took place in Moscow had happened in all the towns and villages on Russian soil beginning with Smol\u00e9nsk, without the participation of Count Rostopch\u00edn and his broadsheets. The people awaited the enemy unconcernedly, did not riot or become excited or tear anyone to pieces, but faced its fate, feeling within it the strength to find what it should do at that most difficult moment. And as soon as the enemy drew near the wealthy classes went away abandoning their property, while the poorer remained and burned and destroyed what was left.\n\nThe consciousness that this would be so and would always be so was and is present in the heart of every Russian. And a consciousness of this, and a foreboding that Moscow would be taken, was present in Russian Moscow society in 1812. Those who had quitted Moscow already in July and at the beginning of August showed that they expected this. Those who went away, taking what they could and abandoning their houses and half their belongings, did so from the latent patriotism which expresses itself not by phrases or by giving one\u2019s children to save the fatherland and similar unnatural exploits, but unobtrusively, simply, organically, and therefore in the way that always produces the most powerful results.\n\n\u201cIt is disgraceful to run away from danger; only cowards are running away from Moscow,\u201d they were told. In his broadsheets Rostopch\u00edn impressed on them that to leave Moscow was shameful. They were ashamed to be called cowards, ashamed to leave, but still they left, knowing it had to be done. Why did they go? It is impossible to suppose that Rostopch\u00edn had scared them by his accounts of horrors Napoleon had committed in conquered countries. The first people to go away were the rich educated people who knew quite well that Vienna and Berlin had remained intact and that during Napoleon\u2019s occupation the inhabitants had spent their time pleasantly in the company of the charming Frenchmen whom the Russians, and especially the Russian ladies, then liked so much.\n\nThey went away because for Russians there could be no question as to whether things would go well or ill under French rule in Moscow. It was out of the question to be under French rule, it would be the worst thing that could happen. They went away even before the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and still more rapidly after it, despite Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s calls to defend Moscow or the announcement of his intention to take the wonder-working icon of the Iberian Mother of God and go to fight, or of the balloons that were to destroy the French, and despite all the nonsense Rostopch\u00edn wrote in his broadsheets. They knew that it was for the army to fight, and that if it could not succeed it would not do to take young ladies and house serfs to the Three Hills quarter of Moscow to fight Napoleon, and that they must go away, sorry as they were to abandon their property to destruction. They went away without thinking of the tremendous significance of that immense and wealthy city being given over to destruction, for a great city with wooden buildings was certain when abandoned by its inhabitants to be burned. They went away each on his own account, and yet it was only in consequence of their going away that the momentous event was accomplished that will always remain the greatest glory of the Russian people. The lady who, afraid of being stopped by Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s orders, had already in June moved with her Negroes and her women jesters from Moscow to her Sar\u00e1tov estate, with a vague consciousness that she was not Bonaparte\u2019s servant, was really, simply, and truly carrying out the great work which saved Russia. But Count Rostopch\u00edn, who now taunted those who left Moscow and now had the government offices removed; now distributed quite useless weapons to the drunken rabble; now had processions displaying the icons, and now forbade Father Augustin to remove icons or the relics of saints; now seized all the private carts in Moscow and on one hundred and thirty-six of them removed the balloon that was being constructed by Leppich; now hinted that he would burn Moscow and related how he had set fire to his own house; now wrote a proclamation to the French solemnly upbraiding them for having destroyed his Orphanage; now claimed the glory of having hinted that he would burn Moscow and now repudiated the deed; now ordered the people to catch all spies and bring them to him, and now reproached them for doing so; now expelled all the French residents from Moscow, and now allowed Madame Aubert-Chalm\u00e9 (the center of the whole French colony in Moscow) to remain, but ordered the venerable old postmaster Klyuchar\u00ebv to be arrested and exiled for no particular offense; now assembled the people at the Three Hills to fight the French and now, to get rid of them, handed over to them a man to be killed and himself drove away by a back gate; now declared that he would not survive the fall of Moscow, and now wrote French verses in albums concerning his share in the affair\u2014this man did not understand the meaning of what was happening but merely wanted to do something himself that would astonish people, to perform some patriotically heroic feat; and like a child he made sport of the momentous, and unavoidable event\u2014the abandonment and burning of Moscow\u2014and tried with his puny hand now to speed and now to stay the enormous, popular tide that bore him along with it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, having returned with the court from V\u00edlna to Petersburg, found herself in a difficult position.\n\nIn Petersburg she had enjoyed the special protection of a grandee who occupied one of the highest posts in the Empire. In V\u00edlna she had formed an intimacy with a young foreign prince. When she returned to Petersburg both the magnate and the prince were there, and both claimed their rights. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was faced by a new problem\u2014how to preserve her intimacy with both without offending either.\n\nWhat would have seemed difficult or even impossible to another woman did not cause the least embarrassment to Countess Bez\u00fakhova, who evidently deserved her reputation of being a very clever woman. Had she attempted concealment, or tried to extricate herself from her awkward position by cunning, she would have spoiled her case by acknowledging herself guilty. But H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, like a really great man who can do whatever he pleases, at once assumed her own position to be correct, as she sincerely believed it to be, and that everyone else was to blame.\n\nThe first time the young foreigner allowed himself to reproach her, she lifted her beautiful head and, half turning to him, said firmly: \u201cThat\u2019s just like a man\u2014selfish and cruel! I expected nothing else. A woman sacrifices herself for you, she suffers, and this is her reward! What right have you, monseigneur, to demand an account of my attachments and friendships? He is a man who has been more than a father to me!\u201d The prince was about to say something, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne interrupted him.\n\n\u201cWell, yes,\u201d said she, \u201cit may be that he has other sentiments for me than those of a father, but that is not a reason for me to shut my door on him. I am not a man, that I should repay kindness with ingratitude! Know, monseigneur, that in all that relates to my intimate feelings I render account only to God and to my conscience,\u201d she concluded, laying her hand on her beautiful, fully expanded bosom and looking up to heaven.\n\n\u201cBut for heaven\u2019s sake listen to me!\u201d\n\n\u201cMarry me, and I will be your slave!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t deign to demean yourself by marrying me, you...\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, beginning to cry.\n\nThe prince tried to comfort her, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, as if quite distraught, said through her tears that there was nothing to prevent her marrying, that there were precedents (there were up to that time very few, but she mentioned Napoleon and some other exalted personages), that she had never been her husband\u2019s wife, and that she had been sacrificed.\n\n\u201cBut the law, religion...\u201d said the prince, already yielding.\n\n\u201cThe law, religion... What have they been invented for if they can\u2019t arrange that?\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nThe prince was surprised that so simple an idea had not occurred to him, and he applied for advice to the holy brethren of the Society of Jesus, with whom he was on intimate terms.\n\nA few days later at one of those enchanting fetes which H\u00e9l\u00e8ne gave at her country house on the Stone Island, the charming Monsieur de Jobert, a man no longer young, with snow white hair and brilliant black eyes, a Jesuit \u00e0 robe courte was presented to her, and in the garden by the light of the illuminations and to the sound of music talked to her for a long time of the love of God, of Christ, of the Sacred Heart, and of the consolations the one true Catholic religion affords in this world and the next. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was touched, and more than once tears rose to her eyes and to those of Monsieur de Jobert and their voices trembled. A dance, for which her partner came to seek her, put an end to her discourse with her future directeur de conscience, but the next evening Monsieur de Jobert came to see H\u00e9l\u00e8ne when she was alone, and after that often came again.\n\nOne day he took the countess to a Roman Catholic church, where she knelt down before the altar to which she was led. The enchanting, middle-aged Frenchman laid his hands on her head and, as she herself afterward described it, she felt something like a fresh breeze wafted into her soul. It was explained to her that this was la gr\u00e2ce.\n\nAfter that a long-frocked abb\u00e9 was brought to her. She confessed to him, and he absolved her from her sins. Next day she received a box containing the Sacred Host, which was left at her house for her to partake of. A few days later H\u00e9l\u00e8ne learned with pleasure that she had now been admitted to the true Catholic Church and that in a few days the Pope himself would hear of her and would send her a certain document.\n\nAll that was done around her and to her at this time, all the attention devoted to her by so many clever men and expressed in such pleasant, refined ways, and the state of dove-like purity she was now in (she wore only white dresses and white ribbons all that time) gave her pleasure, but her pleasure did not cause her for a moment to forget her aim. And as it always happens in contests of cunning that a stupid person gets the better of cleverer ones, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2014having realized that the main object of all these words and all this trouble was, after converting her to Catholicism, to obtain money from her for Jesuit institutions (as to which she received indications)\u2014before parting with her money insisted that the various operations necessary to free her from her husband should be performed. In her view the aim of every religion was merely to preserve certain proprieties while affording satisfaction to human desires. And with this aim, in one of her talks with her Father Confessor, she insisted on an answer to the question, in how far was she bound by her marriage?\n\nThey were sitting in the twilight by a window in the drawing room. The scent of flowers came in at the window. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was wearing a white dress, transparent over her shoulders and bosom. The abb\u00e9, a well-fed man with a plump, clean-shaven chin, a pleasant firm mouth, and white hands meekly folded on his knees, sat close to H\u00e9l\u00e8ne and, with a subtle smile on his lips and a peaceful look of delight at her beauty, occasionally glanced at her face as he explained his opinion on the subject. H\u00e9l\u00e8ne with an uneasy smile looked at his curly hair and his plump, clean-shaven, blackish cheeks and every moment expected the conversation to take a fresh turn. But the abb\u00e9, though he evidently enjoyed the beauty of his companion, was absorbed in his mastery of the matter.\n\nThe course of the Father Confessor\u2019s arguments ran as follows: \u201cIgnorant of the import of what you were undertaking, you made a vow of conjugal fidelity to a man who on his part, by entering the married state without faith in the religious significance of marriage, committed an act of sacrilege. That marriage lacked the dual significance it should have had. Yet in spite of this your vow was binding. You swerved from it. What did you commit by so acting? A venial, or a mortal, sin? A venial sin, for you acted without evil intention. If now you married again with the object of bearing children, your sin might be forgiven. But the question is again a twofold one: firstly...\u201d\n\nBut suddenly H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, who was getting bored, said with one of her bewitching smiles: \u201cBut I think that having espoused the true religion I cannot be bound by what a false religion laid upon me.\u201d\n\nThe director of her conscience was astounded at having the case presented to him thus with the simplicity of Columbus\u2019 egg. He was delighted at the unexpected rapidity of his pupil\u2019s progress, but could not abandon the edifice of argument he had laboriously constructed.\n\n\u201cLet us understand one another, Countess,\u201d said he with a smile, and began refuting his spiritual daughter\u2019s arguments.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne understood that the question was very simple and easy from the ecclesiastical point of view, and that her directors were making difficulties only because they were apprehensive as to how the matter would be regarded by the secular authorities.\n\nSo she decided that it was necessary to prepare the opinion of society. She provoked the jealousy of the elderly magnate and told him what she had told her other suitor; that is, she put the matter so that the only way for him to obtain a right over her was to marry her. The elderly magnate was at first as much taken aback by this suggestion of marriage with a woman whose husband was alive, as the younger man had been, but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s imperturbable conviction that it was as simple and natural as marrying a maiden had its effect on him too. Had H\u00e9l\u00e8ne herself shown the least sign of hesitation, shame, or secrecy, her cause would certainly have been lost; but not only did she show no signs of secrecy or shame, on the contrary, with good-natured na\u00efvet\u00e9 she told her intimate friends (and these were all Petersburg) that both the prince and the magnate had proposed to her and that she loved both and was afraid of grieving either.\n\nA rumor immediately spread in Petersburg, not that H\u00e9l\u00e8ne wanted to be divorced from her husband (had such a report spread many would have opposed so illegal an intention) but simply that the unfortunate and interesting H\u00e9l\u00e8ne was in doubt which of the two men she should marry. The question was no longer whether this was possible, but only which was the better match and how the matter would be regarded at court. There were, it is true, some rigid individuals unable to rise to the height of such a question, who saw in the project a desecration of the sacrament of marriage, but there were not many such and they remained silent, while the majority were interested in H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s good fortune and in the question which match would be the more advantageous. Whether it was right or wrong to remarry while one had a husband living they did not discuss, for that question had evidently been settled by people \u201cwiser than you or me,\u201d as they said, and to doubt the correctness of that decision would be to risk exposing one\u2019s stupidity and incapacity to live in society.\n\nOnly M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna Akhros\u00edmova, who had come to Petersburg that summer to see one of her sons, allowed herself plainly to express an opinion contrary to the general one. Meeting H\u00e9l\u00e8ne at a ball she stopped her in the middle of the room and, amid general silence, said in her gruff voice: \u201cSo wives of living men have started marrying again! Perhaps you think you have invented a novelty? You have been forestalled, my dear! It was thought of long ago. It is done in all the brothels,\u201d and with these words M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna, turning up her wide sleeves with her usual threatening gesture and glancing sternly round, moved across the room.\n\nThough people were afraid of M\u00e1rya Dm\u00edtrievna she was regarded in Petersburg as a buffoon, and so of what she had said they only noticed, and repeated in a whisper, the one coarse word she had used, supposing the whole sting of her remark to lie in that word.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli, who of late very often forgot what he had said and repeated one and the same thing a hundred times, remarked to his daughter whenever he chanced to see her:\n\n\u201cH\u00e9l\u00e8ne, I have a word to say to you,\u201d and he would lead her aside, drawing her hand downward. \u201cI have heard of certain projects concerning... you know. Well my dear child, you know how your father\u2019s heart rejoices to know that you... You have suffered so much.... But, my dear child, consult only your own heart. That is all I have to say,\u201d and concealing his unvarying emotion he would press his cheek against his daughter\u2019s and move away.\n\nBil\u00edbin, who had not lost his reputation of an exceedingly clever man, and who was one of the disinterested friends so brilliant a woman as H\u00e9l\u00e8ne always has\u2014men friends who can never change into lovers\u2014once gave her his view of the matter at a small and intimate gathering.\n\n\u201cListen, Bil\u00edbin,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne (she always called friends of that sort by their surnames), and she touched his coat sleeve with her white, beringed fingers. \u201cTell me, as you would a sister, what I ought to do. Which of the two?\u201d\n\nBil\u00edbin wrinkled up the skin over his eyebrows and pondered, with a smile on his lips.\n\n\u201cYou are not taking me unawares, you know,\u201d said he. \u201cAs a true friend, I have thought and thought again about your affair. You see, if you marry the prince\u201d\u2014he meant the younger man\u2014and he crooked one finger, \u201cyou forever lose the chance of marrying the other, and you will displease the court besides. (You know there is some kind of connection.) But if you marry the old count you will make his last days happy, and as widow of the Grand... the prince would no longer be making a m\u00e9salliance by marrying you,\u201d and Bil\u00edbin smoothed out his forehead.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a true friend!\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne beaming, and again touching Bil\u00edbin\u2019s sleeve. \u201cBut I love them, you know, and don\u2019t want to distress either of them. I would give my life for the happiness of them both.\u201d\n\nBil\u00edbin shrugged his shoulders, as much as to say that not even he could help in that difficulty.\n\n\u201cUne ma\u00eetresse-femme! That\u2019s what is called putting things squarely. She would like to be married to all three at the same time,\u201d thought he.\n\n\u201cBut tell me, how will your husband look at the matter?\u201d Bil\u00edbin asked, his reputation being so well established that he did not fear to ask so na\u00efve a question. \u201cWill he agree?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, he loves me so!\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne", "sequence": 21}, {"offset": 2200000, "text": ", who for some reason imagined that Pierre too loved her. \u201cHe will do anything for me.\u201d\n\nBil\u00edbin puckered his skin in preparation for something witty.\n\n\u201cEven divorce you?\u201d said he.\n\nH\u00e9l\u00e8ne laughed.\n\nAmong those who ventured to doubt the justifiability of the proposed marriage was H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s mother, Princess Kur\u00e1gina. She was continually tormented by jealousy of her daughter, and now that jealousy concerned a subject near to her own heart, she could not reconcile herself to the idea. She consulted a Russian priest as to the possibility of divorce and remarriage during a husband\u2019s lifetime, and the priest told her that it was impossible, and to her delight showed her a text in the Gospel which (as it seemed to him) plainly forbids remarriage while the husband is alive.\n\nArmed with these arguments, which appeared to her unanswerable, she drove to her daughter\u2019s early one morning so as to find her alone.\n\nHaving listened to her mother\u2019s objections, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne smiled blandly and ironically.\n\n\u201cBut it says plainly: \u2018Whosoever shall marry her that is divorced...\u2019\u201d said the old princess.\n\n\u201cAh, Maman, ne dites pas de b\u00eatises. Vous ne comprenez rien. Dans ma position j\u2019ai des devoirs,\u201d said H\u00e9l\u00e8ne changing from Russian, in which language she always felt that her case did not sound quite clear, into French which suited it better.\n\n\u201cBut, my dear....\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, Mamma, how is it you don\u2019t understand that the Holy Father, who has the right to grant dispensations...\u201d\n\nJust then the lady companion who lived with H\u00e9l\u00e8ne came in to announce that His Highness was in the ballroom and wished to see her.\n\n\u201cNon, dites-lui que je ne veux pas le voir, que je suis furieuse contre lui, parce qu\u2019il m\u2019a manqu\u00e9 parole.\u201d\n\n\u201cComtesse, \u00e0 tout p\u00e9ch\u00e9 mis\u00e9ricorde,\u201d said a fair-haired young man with a long face and nose, as he entered the room.\n\nThe old princess rose respectfully and curtsied. The young man who had entered took no notice of her. The princess nodded to her daughter and sidled out of the room.\n\n\u201cYes, she is right,\u201d thought the old princess, all her convictions dissipated by the appearance of His Highness. \u201cShe is right, but how is it that we in our irrecoverable youth did not know it? Yet it is so simple,\u201d she thought as she got into her carriage.\n\n\nBy the beginning of August H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s affairs were clearly defined and she wrote a letter to her husband\u2014who, as she imagined, loved her very much\u2014informing him of her intention to marry N.N. and of her having embraced the one true faith, and asking him to carry out all the formalities necessary for a divorce, which would be explained to him by the bearer of the letter.\n\nAnd so I pray God to have you, my friend, in His holy and powerful keeping\u2014Your friend H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nThis letter was brought to Pierre\u2019s house when he was on the field of Borodin\u00f3.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nToward the end of the battle of Borodin\u00f3, Pierre, having run down from Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s battery a second time, made his way through a gully to Knyazk\u00f3vo with a crowd of soldiers, reached the dressing station, and seeing blood and hearing cries and groans hurried on, still entangled in the crowds of soldiers.\n\nThe one thing he now desired with his whole soul was to get away quickly from the terrible sensations amid which he had lived that day and return to ordinary conditions of life and sleep quietly in a room in his own bed. He felt that only in the ordinary conditions of life would he be able to understand himself and all he had seen and felt. But such ordinary conditions of life were nowhere to be found.\n\nThough shells and bullets did not whistle over the road along which he was going, still on all sides there was what there had been on the field of battle. There were still the same suffering, exhausted, and sometimes strangely indifferent faces, the same blood, the same soldiers\u2019 overcoats, the same sounds of firing which, though distant now, still aroused terror, and besides this there were the foul air and the dust.\n\nHaving gone a couple of miles along the Mozh\u00e1ysk road, Pierre sat down by the roadside.\n\nDusk had fallen, and the roar of guns died away. Pierre lay leaning on his elbow for a long time, gazing at the shadows that moved past him in the darkness. He was continually imagining that a cannon ball was flying toward him with a terrific whizz, and then he shuddered and sat up. He had no idea how long he had been there. In the middle of the night three soldiers, having brought some firewood, settled down near him and began lighting a fire.\n\nThe soldiers, who threw sidelong glances at Pierre, got the fire to burn and placed an iron pot on it into which they broke some dried bread and put a little dripping. The pleasant odor of greasy viands mingled with the smell of smoke. Pierre sat up and sighed. The three soldiers were eating and talking among themselves, taking no notice of him.\n\n\u201cAnd who may you be?\u201d one of them suddenly asked Pierre, evidently meaning what Pierre himself had in mind, namely: \u201cIf you want to eat we\u2019ll give you some food, only let us know whether you are an honest man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, I...\u201d said Pierre, feeling it necessary to minimize his social position as much as possible so as to be nearer to the soldiers and better understood by them. \u201cBy rights I am a militia officer, but my men are not here. I came to the battle and have lost them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now!\u201d said one of the soldiers.\n\nAnother shook his head.\n\n\u201cWould you like a little mash?\u201d the first soldier asked, and handed Pierre a wooden spoon after licking it clean.\n\nPierre sat down by the fire and began eating the mash, as they called the food in the cauldron, and he thought it more delicious than any food he had ever tasted. As he sat bending greedily over it, helping himself to large spoonfuls and chewing one after another, his face was lit up by the fire and the soldiers looked at him in silence.\n\n\u201cWhere have you to go to? Tell us!\u201d said one of them.\n\n\u201cTo Mozh\u00e1ysk.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a gentleman, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what\u2019s your name?\u201d\n\n\u201cPeter Kir\u00edlych.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell then, Peter Kir\u00edlych, come along with us, we\u2019ll take you there.\u201d\n\nIn the total darkness the soldiers walked with Pierre to Mozh\u00e1ysk.\n\nBy the time they got near Mozh\u00e1ysk and began ascending the steep hill into the town, the cocks were already crowing. Pierre went on with the soldiers, quite forgetting that his inn was at the bottom of the hill and that he had already passed it. He would not soon have remembered this, such was his state of forgetfulness, had he not halfway up the hill stumbled upon his groom, who had been to look for him in the town and was returning to the inn. The groom recognized Pierre in the darkness by his white hat.\n\n\u201cYour excellency!\u201d he said. \u201cWhy, we were beginning to despair! How is it you are on foot? And where are you going, please?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes!\u201d said Pierre.\n\nThe soldiers stopped.\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019ve found your folk?\u201d said one of them. \u201cWell, good-by, Peter Kir\u00edlych\u2014isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-by, Peter Kir\u00edlych!\u201d Pierre heard the other voices repeat.\n\n\u201cGood-by!\u201d he said and turned with his groom toward the inn.\n\n\u201cI ought to give them something!\u201d he thought, and felt in his pocket. \u201cNo, better not!\u201d said another, inner voice.\n\nThere was not a room to be had at the inn, they were all occupied. Pierre went out into the yard and, covering himself up head and all, lay down in his carriage.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nScarcely had Pierre laid his head on the pillow before he felt himself falling asleep, but suddenly, almost with the distinctness of reality, he heard the boom, boom, boom of firing, the thud of projectiles, groans and cries, and smelled blood and powder, and a feeling of horror and dread of death seized him. Filled with fright he opened his eyes and lifted his head from under his cloak. All was tranquil in the yard. Only someone\u2019s orderly passed through the gateway, splashing through the mud, and talked to the innkeeper. Above Pierre\u2019s head some pigeons, disturbed by the movement he had made in sitting up, fluttered under the dark roof of the penthouse. The whole courtyard was permeated by a strong peaceful smell of stable yards, delightful to Pierre at that moment. He could see the clear starry sky between the dark roofs of two penthouses.\n\n\u201cThank God, there is no more of that!\u201d he thought, covering up his head again. \u201cOh, what a terrible thing is fear, and how shamefully I yielded to it! But they... they were steady and calm all the time, to the end...\u201d thought he.\n\nThey, in Pierre\u2019s mind, were the soldiers, those who had been at the battery, those who had given him food, and those who had prayed before the icon. They, those strange men he had not previously known, stood out clearly and sharply from everyone else.\n\n\u201cTo be a soldier, just a soldier!\u201d thought Pierre as he fell asleep, \u201cto enter communal life completely, to be imbued by what makes them what they are. But how to cast off all the superfluous, devilish burden of my outer man? There was a time when I could have done it. I could have run away from my father, as I wanted to. Or I might have been sent to serve as a soldier after the duel with D\u00f3lokhov.\u201d And the memory of the dinner at the English Club when he had challenged D\u00f3lokhov flashed through Pierre\u2019s mind, and then he remembered his benefactor at Torzh\u00f3k. And now a picture of a solemn meeting of the lodge presented itself to his mind. It was taking place at the English Club and someone near and dear to him sat at the end of the table. \u201cYes, that is he! It is my benefactor. But he died!\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cYes, he died, and I did not know he was alive. How sorry I am that he died, and how glad I am that he is alive again!\u201d On one side of the table sat Anatole, D\u00f3lokhov, Nesv\u00edtski, Den\u00edsov, and others like them (in his dream the category to which these men belonged was as clearly defined in his mind as the category of those he termed they), and he heard those people, Anatole and D\u00f3lokhov, shouting and singing loudly; yet through their shouting the voice of his benefactor was heard speaking all the time and the sound of his words was as weighty and uninterrupted as the booming on the battlefield, but pleasant and comforting. Pierre did not understand what his benefactor was saying, but he knew (the categories of thoughts were also quite distinct in his dream) that he was talking of goodness and the possibility of being what they were. And they with their simple, kind, firm faces surrounded his benefactor on all sides. But though they were kindly they did not look at Pierre and did not know him. Wishing to speak and to attract their attention, he got up, but at that moment his legs grew cold and bare.\n\nHe felt ashamed, and with one arm covered his legs from which his cloak had in fact slipped. For a moment as he was rearranging his cloak Pierre opened his eyes and saw the same penthouse roofs, posts, and yard, but now they were all bluish, lit up, and glittering with frost or dew.\n\n\u201cIt is dawn,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cBut that\u2019s not what I want. I want to hear and understand my benefactor\u2019s words.\u201d Again he covered himself up with his cloak, but now neither the lodge nor his benefactor was there. There were only thoughts clearly expressed in words, thoughts that someone was uttering or that he himself was formulating.\n\nAfterwards when he recalled those thoughts Pierre was convinced that someone outside himself had spoken them, though the impressions of that day had evoked them. He had never, it seemed to him, been able to think and express his thoughts like that when awake.\n\n\u201cTo endure war is the most difficult subordination of man\u2019s freedom to the law of God,\u201d the voice had said. \u201cSimplicity is submission to the will of God; you cannot escape from Him. And they are simple. They do not talk, but act. The spoken word is silver but the unspoken is golden. Man can be master of nothing while he fears death, but he who does not fear it possesses all. If there were no suffering, man would not know his limitations, would not know himself. The hardest thing (Pierre went on thinking, or hearing, in his dream) is to be able in your soul to unite the meaning of all. To unite all?\u201d he asked himself. \u201cNo, not to unite. Thoughts cannot be united, but to harness all these thoughts together is what we need! Yes, one must harness them, must harness them!\u201d he repeated to himself with inward rapture, feeling that these words and they alone expressed what he wanted to say and solved the question that tormented him.\n\n\u201cYes, one must harness, it is time to harness.\u201d\n\n\u201cTime to harness, time to harness, your excellency! Your excellency!\u201d some voice was repeating. \u201cWe must harness, it is time to harness....\u201d\n\nIt was the voice of the groom, trying to wake him. The sun shone straight into Pierre\u2019s face. He glanced at the dirty innyard in the middle of which soldiers were watering their lean horses at the pump while carts were passing out of the gate. Pierre turned away with repugnance, and closing his eyes quickly fell back on the carriage seat. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want that, I don\u2019t want to see and understand that. I want to understand what was revealing itself to me in my dream. One second more and I should have understood it all! But what am I to do? Harness, but how can I harness everything?\u201d and Pierre felt with horror that the meaning of all he had seen and thought in the dream had been destroyed.\n\nThe groom, the coachman, and the innkeeper told Pierre that an officer had come with news that the French were already near Mozh\u00e1ysk and that our men were leaving it.\n\nPierre got up and, having told them to harness and overtake him, went on foot through the town.\n\nThe troops were moving on, leaving about ten thousand wounded behind them. There were wounded in the yards, at the windows of the houses, and the streets were crowded with them. In the streets, around carts that were to take some of the wounded away, shouts, curses, and blows could be heard. Pierre offered the use of his carriage, which had overtaken him, to a wounded general he knew, and drove with him to Moscow. On the way Pierre was told of the death of his brother-in-law Anatole and of that of Prince Andrew.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOn the thirtieth of August Pierre reached Moscow. Close to the gates of the city he was met by Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s adjutant.\n\n\u201cWe have been looking for you everywhere,\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cThe count wants to see you particularly. He asks you to come to him at once on a very important matter.\u201d\n\nWithout going home, Pierre took a cab and drove to see the Moscow commander in chief.\n\nCount Rostopch\u00edn had only that morning returned to town from his summer villa at Sok\u00f3lniki. The anteroom and reception room of his house were full of officials who had been summoned or had come for orders. Vas\u00edlchikov and Pl\u00e1tov had already seen the count and explained to him that it was impossible to defend Moscow and that it would have to be surrendered. Though this news was being concealed from the inhabitants, the officials\u2014the heads of the various government departments\u2014knew that Moscow would soon be in the enemy\u2019s hands, just as Count Rostopch\u00edn himself knew it, and to escape personal responsibility they had all come to the governor to ask how they were to deal with their various departments.\n\nAs Pierre was entering the reception room a courier from the army came out of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s private room.\n\nIn answer to questions with which he was greeted, the courier made a despairing gesture with his hand and passed through the room.\n\nWhile waiting in the reception room Pierre with weary eyes watched the various officials, old and young, military and civilian, who were there. They all seemed dissatisfied and uneasy. Pierre went up to a group of men, one of whom he knew. After greeting Pierre they continued their conversation.\n\n\u201cIf they\u2019re sent out and brought back again later on it will do no harm, but as things are now one can\u2019t answer for anything.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you see what he writes...\u201d said another, pointing to a printed sheet he held in his hand.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s another matter. That\u2019s necessary for the people,\u201d said the first.\n\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s a fresh broadsheet.\u201d\n\nPierre took it and began reading.\n\nHis Serene Highness has passed through Mozh\u00e1ysk in order to join up with the troops moving toward him and has taken up a strong position where the enemy will not soon attack him. Forty-eight guns with ammunition have been sent him from here, and his Serene Highness says he will defend Moscow to the last drop of blood and is even ready to fight in the streets. Do not be upset, brothers, that the law courts are closed; things have to be put in order, and we will deal with villains in our own way! When the time comes I shall want both town and peasant lads and will raise the cry a day or two beforehand, but they are not wanted yet so I hold my peace. An ax will be useful, a hunting spear not bad, but a three-pronged fork will be best of all: a Frenchman is no heavier than a sheaf of rye. Tomorrow after dinner I shall take the Iberian icon of the Mother of God to the wounded in the Catherine Hospital where we will have some water blessed. That will help them to get well quicker. I, too, am well now: one of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both.\n\n\u201cBut military men have told me that it is impossible to fight in the town,\u201d said Pierre, \u201cand that the position...\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course! That\u2019s what we were saying,\u201d replied the first speaker.\n\n\u201cAnd what does he mean by \u2018One of my eyes was sore but now I am on the lookout with both\u2019?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cThe count had a sty,\u201d replied the adjutant smiling, \u201cand was very much upset when I told him people had come to ask what was the matter with him. By the by, Count,\u201d he added suddenly, addressing Pierre with a smile, \u201cwe heard that you have family troubles and that the countess, your wife...\u201d\n\n\u201cI have heard nothing,\u201d Pierre replied unconcernedly. \u201cBut what have you heard?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, well, you know people often invent things. I only say what I heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what did you hear?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, they say,\u201d continued the adjutant with the same smile, \u201cthat the countess, your wife, is preparing to go abroad. I expect it\u2019s nonsense....\u201d\n\n\u201cPossibly,\u201d remarked Pierre, looking about him absent-mindedly. \u201cAnd who is that?\u201d he asked, indicating a short old man in a clean blue peasant overcoat, with a big snow-white beard and eyebrows and a ruddy face.\n\n\u201cHe? That\u2019s a tradesman, that is to say, he\u2019s the restaurant keeper, Vereshch\u00e1gin. Perhaps you have heard of that affair with the proclamation.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, so that is Vereshch\u00e1gin!\u201d said Pierre, looking at the firm, calm face of the old man and seeking any indication of his being a traitor.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not he himself, that\u2019s the father of the fellow who wrote the proclamation,\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cThe young man is in prison and I expect it will go hard with him.\u201d\n\nAn old gentleman wearing a star and another official, a German wearing a cross round his neck, approached the speaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a complicated story, you know,\u201d said the adjutant. \u201cThat proclamation appeared about two months ago. The count was informed of it. He gave orders to investigate the matter. Gabriel Iv\u00e1novich here made the inquiries. The proclamation had passed through exactly sixty-three hands. He asked one, \u2018From whom did you get it?\u2019 \u2018From so-and-so.\u2019 He went to the next one. \u2018From whom did you get it?\u2019 and so on till he reached Vereshch\u00e1gin, a half educated tradesman, you know, \u2018a pet of a trader,\u2019\u201d said the adjutant smiling. \u201cThey asked him, \u2018Who gave it you?\u2019 And the point is that we knew whom he had it from. He could only have had it from the Postmaster. But evidently they had come to some understanding. He replied: \u2018From no one; I made it up myself.\u2019 They threatened and questioned him, but he stuck to that: \u2018I made it up myself.\u2019 And so it was reported to the count, who sent for the man. \u2018From whom did you get the proclamation?\u2019 \u2018I wrote it myself.\u2019 Well, you know the count,\u201d said the adjutant cheerfully, with a smile of pride, \u201che flared up dreadfully\u2014and just think of the fellow\u2019s audacity, lying, and obstinacy!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the count wanted him to say it was from Klyuchar\u00ebv? I understand!\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d rejoined the adjutant in dismay. \u201cKlyuchar\u00ebv had his own sins to answer for without that and that is why he has been banished. But the point is that the count was much annoyed. \u2018How could you have written it yourself?\u2019 said he, and he took up the Hamburg Gazette that was lying on the table. \u2018Here it is! You did not write it yourself but translated it, and translated it abominably, because you don\u2019t even know French, you fool.\u2019 And what do you think? \u2018No,\u2019 said he, \u2018I have not read any papers, I made it up myself.\u2019 \u2018If that\u2019s so, you\u2019re a traitor and I\u2019ll have you tried, and you\u2019ll be hanged! Say from whom you had it.\u2019 \u2018I have seen no papers, I made it up myself.\u2019 And that was the end of it. The count had the father fetched, but the fellow stuck to it. He was sent for trial and condemned to hard labor, I believe. Now the father has come to intercede for him. But he\u2019s a good-for-nothing lad! You know that sort of tradesman\u2019s son, a dandy and lady-killer. He attended some lectures somewhere and imagines that the devil is no match for him. That\u2019s the sort of fellow he is. His father keeps a cookshop here by the Stone Bridge, and you know there was a large icon of God Almighty painted with a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. Well, he took that icon home with him for a few days and what did he do? He found some scoundrel of a painter...\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nIn the middle of this fresh tale Pierre was summoned to the commander in chief.\n\nWhen he entered the private room Count Rostopch\u00edn, puckering his face, was rubbing his forehead and eyes with his hand. A short man was saying something, but when Pierre entered he stopped speaking and went out.\n\n\u201cAh, how do you do, great warrior?\u201d said Rostopch\u00edn as soon as the short man had left the room. \u201cWe have heard of your prowess. But that\u2019s not the point. Between ourselves, mon cher, do you belong to the Masons?\u201d he went on severely, as though there were something wrong about it which he nevertheless intended to pardon. Pierre remained silent. \u201cI am well informed, my friend, but I am aware that there are Masons and I hope that you are not one of those who on pretense of saving mankind wish to ruin Russia.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I am a Mason,\u201d Pierre replied.\n\n\u201cThere, you see, mon cher! I expect you know that Messrs. Sper\u00e1nski and Magn\u00edtski have been deported to their proper place. Mr. Klyuchar\u00ebv has been treated in the same way, and so have others who on the plea of building up the temple of Solomon have tried to destroy the temple of their fatherland. You can understand that there are reasons for this and that I could not have exiled the Postmaster had he not been a harmful person. It has now come to my knowledge that you lent him your carriage for his removal from town, and that you have even accepted papers from him for safe custody. I like you and don\u2019t wish you any harm and\u2014as you are only half my age\u2014I advise you, as a father would, to cease all communication with men of that stamp and to leave here as soon as possible.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what did Klyuchar\u00ebv do wrong, Count?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cThat is for me to know, but not for you to ask,\u201d shouted Rostopch\u00edn.\n\n\u201cIf he is accused of circulating Napoleon\u2019s proclamation it is not proved that he did so,\u201d said Pierre without looking at Rostopch\u00edn, \u201cand Vereshch\u00e1gin...\u201d\n\n\u201cThere we are!\u201d Rostopch\u00edn shouted at Pierre louder than before, frowning suddenly. \u201cVereshch\u00e1gin is a renegade and a traitor who will be punished as he deserves,\u201d said he with the vindictive heat with which people speak when recalling an insult. \u201cBut I did not summon you to discuss my actions, but to give you advice\u2014or an order if you prefer it. I beg you to leave the town and break off all communication with such men as Klyuchar\u00ebv. And I will knock the nonsense out of anybody\u201d\u2014but probably realizing that he was shouting at Bez\u00fakhov who so far was not guilty of anything, he added, taking Pierre\u2019s hand in a friendly manner, \u201cWe are on the eve of a public disaster and I haven\u2019t time to be polite to everybody who has business with me. My head is sometimes in a whirl. Well, mon cher, what are you doing personally?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, nothing,\u201d answered Pierre without raising his eyes or changing the thoughtful expression of his face.\n\nThe count frowned.\n\n\u201cA word of friendly advice, mon cher. Be off as soon as you can, that\u2019s all I have to tell you. Happy he who has ears to hear. Good-by, my dear fellow. Oh, by the by!\u201d he shouted through the doorway after Pierre, \u201cis it true that the countess has fallen into the clutches of the holy fathers of the Society of Jesus?\u201d\n\nPierre did not answer and left Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s room more sullen and angry than he had ever before shown himself.\n\nWhen he reached home it was already getting dark. Some eight people had come to see him that evening: the secretary of a committee, the colonel of his battalion, his steward, his major-domo, and various petitioners. They all had business with Pierre and wanted decisions from him. Pierre did not understand and was not interested in any of these questions and only answered them in order to get rid of these people. When left alone at last he opened and read his wife\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cThey, the soldiers at the battery, Prince Andrew killed... that old man... Simplicity is submission to God. Suffering is necessary... the meaning of all... one must harness... my wife is getting married... One must forget and understand...\u201d And going to his bed he threw himself on it without undressing and immediately fell asleep.\n\nWhen he awoke next morning the major-domo came to inform him that a special messenger, a police officer, had come from Count Rostopch\u00edn to know whether Count Bez\u00fakhov had left or was leaving the town.\n\nA dozen persons who had business with Pierre were awaiting him in the drawing room. Pierre dressed hurriedly and, instead of going to see them, went to the back porch and out through the gate.\n\nFrom that time till the end of the destruction of Moscow no one of Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s household, despite all the search they made, saw Pierre again or knew where he was.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nThe Rost\u00f3vs remained in Moscow till the first of September, that is, till the eve of the enemy\u2019s entry into the city.\n\nAfter P\u00e9tya had joined Obol\u00e9nski\u2019s regiment of Cossacks and left for B\u00e9laya Ts\u00e9rkov where that regiment was forming, the countess was seized with terror. The thought that both her sons were at the war, had both gone from under her wing, that today or tomorrow either or both of them might be killed like the three sons of one of her acquaintances, struck her that summer for the first time with cruel clearness. She tried to get Nicholas back and wished to go herself to join P\u00e9tya, or to get him an appointment somewhere in Petersburg, but neither of these proved possible. P\u00e9tya could not return unless his regiment did so or unless he was transferred to another regiment on active service. Nicholas was somewhere with the army and had not sent a word since his last letter, in which he had given a detailed account of his meeting with Princess Mary. The countess did not sleep at night, or when she did fall asleep dreamed that she saw her sons lying dead. After many consultations and conversations, the count at last devised means to tranquillize her. He got P\u00e9tya transferred from Obol\u00e9nski\u2019s regiment to Bez\u00fakhov\u2019s, which was in training near Moscow. Though P\u00e9tya would remain in the service, this transfer would give the countess the consolation of seeing at least one of her sons under her wing, and she hoped to arrange matters for her P\u00e9tya so as not to let him go again, but always get him appointed to places where he could not possibly take part in a battle. As long as Nicholas alone was in danger the countess imagined that she loved her first-born more than all her other children and even reproached herself for it; but when her youngest: the scapegrace who had been bad at lessons, was always breaking things in the house and making himself a nuisance to everybody, that snub-nosed P\u00e9tya with his merry black eyes and fresh rosy cheeks where soft down was just beginning to show\u2014when he was thrown amid those big, dreadful, cruel men who were fighting somewhere about something and apparently finding pleasure in it\u2014then his mother thought she loved him more, much more, than all her other children. The nearer the time came for P\u00e9tya to return, the more uneasy grew the countess. She began to think she would never live to see such happiness. The presence of S\u00f3nya, of her beloved Nat\u00e1sha, or even of her husband irritated her. \u201cWhat do I want with them? I want no one but P\u00e9tya,\u201d she thought.\n\nAt the end of August the Rost\u00f3vs received another letter from Nicholas. He wrote from the province of Vor\u00f3nezh where he had been sent to procure remounts, but that letter did not set the countess at ease. Knowing that one son was out of danger she became the more anxious about P\u00e9tya.\n\nThough by the twentieth of August nearly all the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 acquaintances had left Moscow, and though everybody tried to persuade the countess to get away as quickly as possible, she would not hear of leaving before her treasure, her adored P\u00e9tya, returned. On the twenty-eighth of August he arrived. The passionate tenderness with which his mother received him did not please the sixteen-year-old officer. Though she concealed from him her intention of keeping him under her wing, P\u00e9tya guessed her designs, and instinctively fearing that he might give way to emotion when with her\u2014might \u201cbecome womanish\u201d as he termed it to himself\u2014he treated her coldly, avoided her, and during his stay in Moscow attached himself exclusively to Nat\u00e1sha for whom he had always had a particularly brotherly tenderness, almost lover-like.\n\nOwing to the count\u2019s customary carelessness nothing was ready for their departure by the twenty-eighth of August and the carts that were to come from their Ryaz\u00e1n and Moscow estates to remove their household belongings did not arrive till the thirtieth.\n\nFrom the twenty-eighth till the thirty-first all Moscow was in a bustle and commotion. Every day thousands of men wounded at Borodin\u00f3 were brought in by the Dorogom\u00edlov gate and taken to various parts of Moscow, and thousands of carts conveyed the inhabitants and their possessions out by the other gates. In spite of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheets, or because of them or independently of them, the strangest and most contradictory rumors were current in the town. Some said that no one was to be allowed to leave the city, others on the contrary said that all the icons had been taken out of the churches and everybody was to be ordered to leave. Some said there had been another battle after Borodin\u00f3 at which the French had been routed, while others on the contrary reported that the Russian army had been destroyed. Some talked about the Moscow militia which, preceded by the clergy, would go to the Three Hills; others whispered that Augustin had been forbidden to leave, that traitors had been seized, that the peasants were rioting and robbing people on their way from Moscow, and so on. But all this was only talk; in reality (though the Council of Fil\u00ed, at which it was decided to abandon Moscow, had not yet been held) both those who went away and those who remained behind felt, though they did not show it, that Moscow would certainly be abandoned, and that they ought to get away as quickly as possible and save their belongings. It was felt that everything would suddenly break up and change, but up to the first of September nothing had done so. As a criminal who is being led to execution knows that he must die immediately, but yet looks about him and straightens the cap that is awry on his head, so Moscow involuntarily continued its wonted life, though it knew that the time of its destruction was near when the conditions of life to which its people were accustomed to submit would be completely upset.\n\nDuring the three days preceding the occupation of Moscow the whole Rost\u00f3v family was absorbed in various activities. The head of the family, Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v, continually drove about the city collecting the current rumors from all sides and gave superficial and hasty orders at home about the preparations for their departure.\n\nThe countess watched the things being packed, was dissatisfied with everything, was constantly in pursuit of P\u00e9tya who was always running away from her, and was jealous of Nat\u00e1sha with whom he spent all his time. S\u00f3nya alone directed the practical side of matters by getting things packed. But of late S\u00f3nya had been particularly sad and silent. Nicholas\u2019 letter in which he mentioned Princess Mary had elicited, in her presence, joyous comments from the countess, who saw an intervention of Providence in this meeting of the princess and Nicholas.\n\n\u201cI was never pleased at Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s engagement to Nat\u00e1sha,\u201d said the countess, \u201cbut I always wanted Nicholas to marry the princess, and had a presentiment that it would happen. What a good thing it would be!\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya felt that this was true: that the only possibility of retrieving the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 affairs was by Nicholas marrying a rich woman, and that the princess was a good match. It was very bitter for her. But despite her grief, or perhaps just because of it, she took on herself all the difficult work of directing the storing and packing of their things and was busy for whole days. The count and countess turned to her when they had any orders to give. P\u00e9tya and Nat\u00e1sha on the contrary, far from helping their parents, were generally a nuisance and a hindrance to everyone. Almost all day long the house resounded with their running feet, their cries, and their spontaneous laughter. They laughed and were gay not because there was any reason to laugh, but because gaiety and mirth were in their hearts and so everything that happened was a cause for gaiety and laughter to them. P\u00e9tya was in high spirits because having left home a boy he had returned (as everybody told him) a fine young man, because he was at home, because he had left B\u00e9laya Ts\u00e9rkov where there was no hope of soon taking part in a battle and had come to Moscow where there was to be fighting in a few days, and chiefly because Nat\u00e1sha, whose lead he always followed, was in high spirits. Nat\u00e1sha was gay because she had been sad too long and now nothing reminded her of the cause of her sadness, and because she was feeling well. She was also happy because she had someone to adore her: the adoration of others was a lubricant the wheels of her machine needed to make them run freely\u2014and P\u00e9tya adored her. Above all, they were gay because there was a war near Moscow, there would be fighting at the town gates, arms were being given out, everybody was escaping\u2014going away somewhere, and in general something extraordinary was happening, and that is always exciting, especially to the young.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nOn Saturday, the thirty-first of August, everything in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house seemed topsy-turvy. All the doors were open, all the furniture was being carried out or moved about, and the mirrors and pictures had been taken down. There were trunks in the rooms, and hay, wrapping paper, and ropes were scattered about. The peasants and house serfs carrying out the things were treading heavily on the parquet floors. The yard was crowded with peasant carts, some loaded high and already corded up, others still empty.\n\nThe voices and footsteps of the many servants and of the peasants who had come with the carts resounded as they shouted to one another in the yard and in the house. The count had been out since morning. The countess had a headache brought on by all the noise and turmoil and was lying down in the new sitting room with a vinegar compress on her head. P\u00e9tya was not at home, he had gone to visit a friend with whom he meant to obtain a transfer from the militia to the active army. S\u00f3nya was in the ballroom looking after the packing of the glass and china. Nat\u00e1sha was sitting on the floor of her dismantled room with dresses, ribbons, and scarves strewn all about her, gazing fixedly at the floor and holding in her hands the old ball dress (already out of fashion) which she had worn at her first Petersburg ball.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was ashamed of doing nothing when everyone else was so busy, and several times that morning had tried to set to work, but her heart was not in it, and she could not and did not know how to do anything except with all her heart and all her might. For a while she had stood beside S\u00f3nya while the china was being packed and tried to help, but soon gave it up and went to her room to pack her own things. At first she found it amusing to give away dresses and ribbons to the maids, but when that was done and what was left had still to be packed, she found it dull.\n\n\u201cDuny\u00e1sha, you pack! You will, won\u2019t you, dear?\u201d And when Duny\u00e1sha willingly promised to do it all for her, Nat\u00e1sha sat down on the floor, took her old ball dress, and fell into a reverie quite unrelated to what ought to have occupied her thoughts now. She was roused from her reverie by the talk of the maids in the next room (which was theirs) and by the sound of their hurried footsteps going to the back porch. Nat\u00e1sha got up and looked out of the window. An enormously long row of carts full of wounded men had stopped in the street.\n\nThe housekeeper, the old nurse, the cooks, coachmen, maids, footmen, postilions, and scullions stood at the gate, staring at the wounded.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, throwing a clean pocket handkerchief over her hair and holding an end of it in each hand, went out into the street.\n\nThe former housekeeper, old M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, had stepped out of the crowd by the gate, gone up to a cart with a hood constructed of bast mats, and was speaking to a pale young officer who lay inside. Nat\u00e1sha moved a few steps forward and stopped shyly, still holding her handkerchief, and listened to what the housekeeper was saying.\n\n\u201cThen you have nobody in Moscow?\u201d she was saying. \u201cYou would be more comfortable somewhere in a house... in ours, for instance... the family are leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if it would be allowed,\u201d replied the officer in a weak voice. \u201cHere is our commanding officer... ask him,\u201d and he pointed to a stout major who was walking back along the street past the row of carts.\n\nNat\u00e1sha glanced with frightened eyes at the face of the wounded officer and at once went to meet the major.\n\n\u201cMay the wounded men stay in our house?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe major raised his hand to his cap with a smile.\n\n\u201cWhich one do you want, Ma\u2019am\u2019selle?\u201d said he, screwing up his eyes and smiling.\n\nNat\u00e1sha quietly repeated her question, and her face and whole manner were so serious, though she was still holding the ends of her handkerchief, that the major ceased smiling and after some reflection\u2014as if considering in how far the thing was possible\u2014replied in the affirmative.\n\n\u201cOh yes, why not? They may,\u201d he said.\n\nWith a slight inclination of her head, Nat\u00e1sha stepped back quickly to M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, who stood talking compassionately to the officer.\n\n\u201cThey may. He says they may!\u201d whispered Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nThe cart in which the officer lay was turned into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard, and dozens of carts with wounded men began at the invitation of the townsfolk to turn into the yards and to draw up at the entrances of the houses in Povarsk\u00e1ya Street. Nat\u00e1sha was evidently pleased to be dealing with new people outside the ordinary routine of her life. She and M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna tried to get as many of the wounded as possible into their yard.\n\n\u201cYour Papa must be told, though,\u201d said M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna.\n\n\u201cNever mind, never mind, what does it matter? For one day we can move into the drawing room. They can have all our half of the house.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere now, young lady, you do take things into your head! Even if we put them into the wing, the men\u2019s room, or the nurse\u2019s room, we must ask permission.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I\u2019ll ask.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha ran into the house and went on tiptoe through the half-open door into the sitting room, where there was a smell of vinegar and Hoffman\u2019s drops.\n\n\u201cAre you asleep, Mamma?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, what sleep\u2014?\u201d said the countess, waking up just as she was dropping into a doze.\n\n\u201cMamma darling!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, kneeling by her mother and bringing her face close to her mother\u2019s, \u201cI am sorry, forgive me, I\u2019ll never do it again; I woke you up! M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna has sent me: they have brought some wounded here\u2014officers. Will you let them come? They have nowhere to go. I knew you\u2019d let them come!\u201d she said quickly all in one breath.\n\n\u201cWhat officers? Whom have they brought? I don\u2019t understand anything about it,\u201d said the countess.\n\nNat\u00e1sha laughed, and the countess too smiled slightly.\n\n\u201cI knew you\u2019d give permission... so I\u2019ll tell them,\u201d and, having kissed her mother, Nat\u00e1sha got up and went to the door.\n\nIn the hall she met her father, who had returned with bad news.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve stayed too long!\u201d said the count with involuntary vexation. \u201cThe Club is closed and the police are leaving.\u201d\n\n\u201cPapa, is it all right\u2014I\u2019ve invited some of the wounded into the house?\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cOf course it is,\u201d he answered absently. \u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I beg you not to indulge in trifles now, but to help to pack, and tomorrow we must go, go, go!...\u201d\n\nAnd the count gave a similar order to the major-domo and the servants.\n\nAt dinner P\u00e9tya having returned home told them the news he had heard. He said the people had been getting arms in the Kr\u00e9mlin, and that though Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s broadsheet had said that he would sound a call two or three days in advance, the order had certainly already been given for everyone to go armed to the Three Hills tomorrow, and that there would be a big battle there.\n\nThe countess looked with timid horror at her son\u2019s eager, excited face as he said this. She realized that if she said a word about his not going to the battle (she knew he enjoyed the thought of the impending engagement) he would say something about men, honor, and the fatherland\u2014something senseless, masculine, and obstinate which there would be no contradicting, and her plans would be spoiled; and so, hoping to arrange to leave before then and take P\u00e9tya with her as their protector and defender, she did not answer him, but after dinner called the count aside and implored him with tears to take her away quickly, that very night if possible. With a woman\u2019s involuntary loving cunning she, who till then had not shown any alarm, said that she would die of fright if they did not leave that very night. Without any pretense she was now afraid of everything.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nMadame Schoss, who had been out to visit her daughter, increased the countess\u2019 fears still more by telling what she had seen at a spirit dealer\u2019s in Myasn\u00edtski Street. When returning by that street she had been unable to pass because of a drunken crowd rioting in front of the shop. She had taken a cab and driven home by a side street and the cabman had told her that the people were breaking open the barrels at the drink store, having received orders to do so.\n\nAfter dinner the whole Rost\u00f3v household set to work with enthusiastic haste packing their belongings and preparing for their departure. The old count, suddenly setting to work, kept passing from the yard to the house and back again, shouting confused instructions to the hurrying people, and flurrying them still more. P\u00e9tya directed things in the yard. S\u00f3nya, owing to the count\u2019s contradictory orders, lost her head and did not know what to do. The servants ran noisily about the house and yard, shouting and disputing. Nat\u00e1sha, with the ardor characteristic of all she did suddenly set to work too. At first her intervention in the business of packing was received skeptically. Everybody expected some prank from her and did not wish to obey her; but she resolutely and passionately demanded obedience, grew angry and nearly cried because they did not heed her, and at last succeeded in making them believe her. Her first exploit, which cost her immense effort and established her authority, was the packing of the carpets. The count had valuable Gobelin tapestries and Persian carpets in the house. When Nat\u00e1sha set to work two cases were standing open in the ballroom, one almost full up with crockery, the other with carpets. There was also much china standing on the tables, and still more was being brought in from the storeroom. A third case was needed and servants had gone to fetch it.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, wait a bit\u2014we\u2019ll pack everything into these,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t, Miss, we have tried to,\u201d said the butler\u2019s assistant.\n\n\u201cNo, wait a minute, please.\u201d\n\nAnd Nat\u00e1sha began rapidly taking out of the case dishes and plates wrapped in paper.\n\n\u201cThe dishes must go in here among the carpets,\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cWhy, it\u2019s a mercy if we can get the carpets alone into three cases,\u201d said the butler\u2019s assistant.\n\n\u201cOh, wait, please!\u201d And Nat\u00e1sha began rapidly and deftly sorting out the things. \u201cThese aren\u2019t needed,\u201d said she, putting aside some plates of Kiev ware. \u201cThese\u2014yes, these must go among the carpets,\u201d she said, referring to the Saxony china dishes.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Nat\u00e1sha! Leave it alone! We\u2019ll get it all packed,\u201d urged S\u00f3nya reproachfully.\n\n\u201cWhat a young lady she is!\u201d remarked the major-domo.\n\nBut Nat\u00e1sha would not give in. She turned everything out and began quickly repacking, deciding that the inferior Russian carpets and unnecessary crockery should not be taken at all. When everything had been taken out of the cases, they recommenced packing, and it turned out that when the cheaper things not worth taking had nearly all been rejected, the valuable ones really did all go into the two cases. Only the lid of the case containing the carpets would not shut down. A few more things might have been taken out, but Nat\u00e1sha insisted on having her own way. She packed, repacked, pressed, made the butler\u2019s assistant and P\u00e9tya\u2014whom she had drawn into the business of packing\u2014press on the lid, and made desperate efforts herself.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s enough, Nat\u00e1sha,\u201d said S\u00f3nya. \u201cI see you were right, but just take out the top one.\u201d\n\n\u201cI won\u2019t!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, with one hand holding back the hair that hung over her perspiring face, while with the other she pressed down the carpets. \u201cNow press, P\u00e9tya! Press, Vas\u00edlich, press hard!\u201d she cried.\n\nThe carpets yielded and the lid closed; Nat\u00e1sha, clapping her hands, screamed with delight and tears fell from her eyes. But this only lasted a moment. She at once set to work afresh and they now trusted her completely. The count was not angry even when they told him that Nat\u00e1sha had countermanded an order of his, and the servants now came to her to ask whether a cart was sufficiently loaded, and whether it might be corded up. Thanks to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s directions the work now went on expeditiously, unnecessary things were left, and the most valuable packed as compactly as possible.\n\nBut hard as they all worked till quite late that night, they could not get everything packed. The countess had fallen asleep and the count, having put off their departure till next morning, went to bed.\n\nS\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha slept in the sitting room without undressing.\n\nThat night another wounded man was driven down the Povarsk\u00e1ya, and M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, who was standing at the gate, had him brought into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard. M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna concluded that he was a very important man. He was being conveyed in a cal\u00e8che with a raised hood, and was quite covered by an apron. On the box beside the driver sat a venerable old attendant. A doctor and two soldiers followed the carriage in a cart.\n\n\u201cPlease come in here. The masters are going away and the whole house will be empty,\u201d said the old woman to the old attendant.\n\n\u201cWell, perhaps,\u201d said he with a sigh. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to get him home alive! We have a house of our own in Moscow, but it\u2019s a long way from here, and there\u2019s nobody living in it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo us the honor to come in, there\u2019s plenty of everything in the master\u2019s house. Come in,\u201d said M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna. \u201cIs he very ill?\u201d she asked.\n\nThe attendant made a hopeless gesture.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t expect to get him home! We must ask the doctor.\u201d\n\nAnd the old servant got down from the box and went up to the cart.\n\n\u201cAll right!\u201d said the doctor.\n\nThe old servant returned to the cal\u00e8che, looked into it, shook his head disconsolately, told the driver to turn into the yard, and stopped beside M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna.\n\n\u201cO, Lord Jesus Christ!\u201d she murmured.\n\nShe invited them to take the wounded man into the house.\n\n\u201cThe masters won\u2019t object...\u201d she said.\n\nBut they had to avoid carrying the man upstairs, and so they took him into the wing and put him in the room that had been Madame Schoss\u2019.\n\nThis wounded man was Prince Andrew Bolk\u00f3nski.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nMoscow\u2019s last day had come. It was a clear bright autumn day, a Sunday. The church bells everywhere were ringing for service, just as usual on Sundays. Nobody seemed yet to realize what awaited the city.\n\nOnly two things indicated the social condition of Moscow\u2014the rabble, that is the poor people, and the price of commodities. An enormous crowd of factory hands, house serfs, and peasants, with whom some officials, seminarists, and gentry were mingled, had gone early that morning to the Three Hills. Having waited there for Rostopch\u00edn who did not turn up, they became convinced that Moscow would be surrendered, and then dispersed all about the town to the public houses and cookshops. Prices too that day indicated the state of affairs. The price of weapons, of gold, of carts and horses, kept rising, but the value of paper money and city articles kept falling, so that by midday there were instances of carters removing valuable goods, such as cloth, and receiving in payment a half of what they carted, while peasant horses were fetching five hundred rubles each, and furniture, mirrors, and bronzes were being given away for nothing.\n\nIn the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 staid old-fashioned house the dissolution of former conditions of life was but little noticeable. As to the serfs the only indication was that three out of their huge retinue disappeared during the night, but nothing was stolen; and as to the value of their possessions, the thirty peasant carts that had come in from their estates and which many people envied proved to be extremely valuable and they were offered enormous sums of money for them. Not only were huge sums offered for the horses and carts, but on the previous evening and early in the morning of the first of September, orderlies and servants sent by wounded officers came to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and wounded men dragged themselves there from the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and from neighboring houses where they were accommodated, entreating the servants to try to get them a lift out of Moscow. The major-domo to whom these entreaties were addressed, though he was sorry for the wounded, resolutely refused, saying that he dare not even mention the matter to the count. Pity these wounded men as one might, it was evident that if they were given one cart there would be no reason to refuse another, or all the carts and one\u2019s own carriages as well. Thirty carts could not save all the wounded and in the general catastrophe one could not disregard oneself and one\u2019s own family. So thought the major-domo on his master\u2019s behalf.\n\nOn waking up that morning Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v left his bedroom softly, so as not to wake the countess who had fallen asleep only toward morning, and came out to the porch in his lilac silk dressing gown. In the yard stood the carts ready corded. The carriages were at the front porch. The major-domo stood at the porch talking to an elderly orderly and to a pale young officer with a bandaged arm. On seeing the count the major-domo made a significant and stern gesture to them both to go away.\n\n\u201cWell, Vas\u00edlich, is everything ready?\u201d asked the count, and stroking his bald head he looked good-naturedly at the officer and the orderly and nodded to them. (He liked to see new faces.)\n\n\u201cWe can harness at once, your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s right. As soon as the countess wakes we\u2019ll be off, God willing! What is it, gentlemen?\u201d he added, turning to the officer. \u201cAre you staying in my house?\u201d\n\nThe officer came nearer and suddenly his face flushed crimson.\n\n\u201cCount, be so good as to allow me... for God\u2019s sake, to get into some corner of one of your carts! I have nothing here with me.... I shall be all right on a loaded cart....\u201d\n\nBefore the officer had finished speaking the orderly made the same request on behalf of his master.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, yes, yes!\u201d said the count hastily. \u201cI shall be very pleased, very pleased. Vas\u00edlich, you\u2019ll see to it. Just unload one or two carts. Well, what of it... do what\u2019s necessary...\u201d said the count, muttering some indefinite order.\n\nBut at the same moment an expression of warm gratitude on the officer\u2019s face had already sealed the order. The count looked around him. In the yard, at the gates, at the window of the wings, wounded officers and their orderlies were to be seen. They were all looking at the count and moving toward the porch.\n\n\u201cPlease step into the gallery, your excellency,\u201d said the major-domo. \u201cWhat are your orders about the pictures?\u201d\n\nThe count went into the house with him, repeating his order not to refuse the wounded who asked for a lift.\n\n\u201cWell, never mind, some of the things can be unloaded,\u201d he added in a soft, confidential voice, as though afraid of being overheard.\n\nAt nine o\u2019clock the countess woke up, and Matr\u00ebna Timof\u00e9evna, who had been her lady\u2019s maid before her marriage and now performed a sort of chief gendarme\u2019s duty for her, came to say that Madame Schoss was much offended and the young ladies\u2019 summer dresses could not be left behind. On inquiry, the countess learned that Madame Schoss was offended because her trunk had been taken down from its cart, and all the loads were being uncorded and the luggage taken out of the carts to make room for wounded men whom the count in the simplicity of his heart had ordered that they should take with them. The countess sent for her husband.\n\n\u201cWhat is this, my dear? I hear that the luggage is being unloaded.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou know, love, I wanted to tell you... Countess dear... an officer came to me to ask for a few carts for the wounded. After all, ours are things that can be bought but think what being left behind means to them!... Really now, in our own yard\u2014we asked them in ourselves and there are officers among them.... You know, I think, my dear... let them be taken... where\u2019s the hurry?\u201d\n\nThe count spoke timidly, as he always did when talking of money matters. The countess was accustomed to this tone as a precursor of news of something detrimental to the children\u2019s interests, such as the building of a new gallery or conservatory, the inauguration of a private theater or an orchestra. She was accustomed always to oppose anything announced in that timid tone and considered it her duty to do so.\n\nShe assumed her dolefully submissive manner and said to her husband: \u201cListen to me, Count, you have managed matters so that we are getting nothing for the house, and now you wish to throw away all our\u2014all the children\u2019s property! You said yourself that we have a hundred thousand rubles\u2019 worth of things in the house. I don\u2019t consent, my dear, I don\u2019t! Do as you please! It\u2019s the government\u2019s business to look after the wounded; they know that. Look at the Lopukh\u00edns opposite, they cleared out everything two days ago. That\u2019s what other people do. It\u2019s only we who are such fools. If you have no pity on me, have some for the children.\u201d\n\nFlourishing his arms in despair the count left the room without replying.\n\n\u201cPapa, what are you doing that for?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, who had followed him into her mother\u2019s room.\n\n\u201cNothing! What business is it of yours?\u201d muttered the count angrily.\n\n\u201cBut I heard,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cWhy does Mamma object?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat business is it of yours?\u201d cried the count.\n\nNat\u00e1sha stepped up to the window and pondered.\n\n\u201cPapa! Here\u2019s Berg coming to see us,\u201d said she, looking out of the window.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nBerg, the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 son-in-law, was already a colonel wearing the orders of Vlad\u00edmir and Anna, and he still filled the quiet and agreeable post of assistant to the head of the staff of the assistant commander of the first division of the Second Army.\n\nOn the first of September he had come to Moscow from the army.\n\nHe had nothing to do in Moscow, but he had noticed that everyone in the army was asking for leave to visit Moscow and had something to do there. So he considered it necessary to ask for leave of absence for family and domestic reasons.\n\nBerg drove up to his father-in-law\u2019s house in his spruce little trap with a pair of sleek roans, exactly like those of a certain prince. He looked attentively at the carts in the yard and while going up to the porch took out a clean pocket handkerchief and tied a knot in it.\n\nFrom the anteroom Berg ran with smooth though impatient steps into the drawing room, where he embraced the count, kissed the hands of Nat\u00e1sha and S\u00f3nya, and hastened to inquire after \u201cMamma\u2019s\u201d health.\n\n\u201cHealth, at a time like this?\u201d said the count. \u201cCome, tell us the news! Is the army retreating or will there be another battle?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod Almighty alone can decide the fate of our fatherland, Papa,\u201d said Berg. \u201cThe army is burning with a spirit of heroism and the leaders, so to say, have now assembled in council. No one knows what is coming. But in general I can tell you, Papa, that such a heroic spirit, the truly antique valor of the Russian army, which they\u2014which it\u201d (he corrected himself) \u201chas shown or displayed in the battle of the twenty-sixth\u2014there are no words worthy to do it justice! I tell you, Papa\u201d (he smote himself on the breast as a general he had heard speaking had done, but Berg did it a trifle late for he should have struck his breast at the words \u201cRussian army\u201d), \u201cI tell you frankly that we, the commanders, far from having to urge the men on or anything of that kind, could hardly restrain those... those... yes, those exploits of antique valor,\u201d he went on rapidly. \u201cGeneral Barclay de Tolly risked his life everywhere at the head of the troops, I can assure you. Our corps was stationed on a hillside. You can imagine!\u201d\n\nAnd Berg related all that he remembered of the various tales he had heard those days. Nat\u00e1sha watched him with an intent gaze that confused him, as if she were trying to find in his face the answer to some question.\n\n\u201cAltogether such heroism as was displayed by the Russian warriors cannot be imagined or adequately praised!\u201d said Berg, glancing round at Nat\u00e1sha, and as if anxious to conciliate her, replying to her intent look with a smile. \u201c\u2018Russia is not in Moscow, she lives in the hearts of her sons!\u2019 Isn\u2019t it so, Papa?\u201d said he.\n\nJust then the countess came in from the sitting room with a weary and dissatisfied expression. Berg hurriedly jumped up, kissed her hand, asked about her health, and, swaying his head from side to side to express sympathy, remained standing beside her.\n\n\u201cYes, Mamma, I tell you sincerely that these are hard and sad times for every Russian. But why are you so anxious? You have still time to get away....\u201d\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think what the servants are about,\u201d said the countess, turning to her husband. \u201cI have just been told that nothing is ready yet. Somebody after all must see to things. One misses M\u00edtenka at such times. There won\u2019t be any end to it.\u201d\n\nThe count was about to say something, but evidently restrained himself. He got up from his chair and went to the door.\n\nAt that moment Berg drew out his handkerchief as if to blow his nose and, seeing the knot in it, pondered, shaking his head sadly and significantly.\n\n\u201cAnd I have a great favor to ask of you, Papa,\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cHm...\u201d said the count, and stopped.\n\n\u201cI was driving past Yus\u00fapov\u2019s house just now,\u201d said Berg with a laugh, \u201cwhen the steward, a man I know, ran out and asked me whether I wouldn\u2019t buy something. I went in out of curiosity, you know, and there is a small chiffonier and a dressing table. You know how dear V\u00e9ra wanted a chiffonier like that and how we had a dispute about it.\u201d (At the mention of the chiffonier and dressing table Berg involuntarily changed his tone to one of pleasure at his admirable domestic arrangements.) \u201cAnd it\u2019s such a beauty! It pulls out and has a secret English drawer, you know! And dear V\u00e9ra has long wanted one. I wish to give her a surprise, you see. I saw so many of those peasant carts in your yard. Please let me have one, I will pay the man well, and...\u201d\n\nThe count frowned and coughed.\n\n\u201cAsk the countess, I don\u2019t give orders.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf it\u2019s inconvenient, please don\u2019t,\u201d said Berg. \u201cOnly I so wanted it, for dear V\u00e9ra\u2019s sake.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, go to the devil, all of you! To the devil, the devil, the devil...\u201d cried the old count. \u201cMy head\u2019s in a whirl!\u201d\n\nAnd he left the room. The countess began to cry.\n\n\u201cYes, Mamma! Yes, these are very hard times!\u201d said Berg.\n\nNat\u00e1sha left the room with her father and, as if finding it difficult to reach some decision, first followed him and then ran downstairs.\n\nP\u00e9tya was in the porch, engaged in giving out weapons to the servants who were to leave Moscow. The loaded carts were still standing in the yard. Two of them had been uncorded and a wounded officer was climbing into one of them helped by an orderly.\n\n\u201cDo you know what it\u2019s about?\u201d P\u00e9tya asked Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nShe understood that he meant what were their parents quarreling about. She did not answer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s because Papa wanted to give up all the carts to the wounded,\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cVas\u00edlich told me. I consider...\u201d\n\n\u201cI consider,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly almost shouted, turning her angry face to P\u00e9tya, \u201cI consider it so horrid, so abominable, so... I don\u2019t know what. Are we despicable Germans?\u201d\n\nHer throat quivered with convulsive sobs and, afraid of weakening and letting the force of her anger run to waste, she turned and rushed headlong up the stairs.\n\nBerg was sitting beside the countess consoling her with the respectful attention of a relative. The count, pipe in hand, was pacing up and down the room, when Nat\u00e1sha, her face distorted by anger, burst in like a tempest and approached her mother with rapid steps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s horrid! It\u2019s abominable!\u201d she screamed. \u201cYou can\u2019t possibly have ordered it!\u201d\n\nBerg and the countess looked at her, perplexed and frightened. The count stood still at the window and listened.\n\n\u201cMamma, it\u2019s impossible: see what is going on in the yard!\u201d she cried. \u201cThey will be left!...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the matter with you? Who are \u2018they\u2019? What do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, the wounded! It\u2019s impossible, Mamma. It\u2019s monstrous!... No, Mamma darling, it\u2019s not the thing. Please forgive me, darling.... Mamma, what does it matter what we take away? Only look what is going on in the yard... Mamma!... It\u2019s impossible!\u201d\n\nThe count stood by the window and listened without turning round. Suddenly he sniffed and put his face closer to the window.\n\nThe countess glanced at her daughter, saw her face full of shame for her mother, saw her agitation, and understood why her husband did not turn to look at her now, and she glanced round quite disconcerted.\n\n\u201cOh, do as you like! Am I hindering anyone?\u201d she said, not surrendering at once.\n\n\u201cMamma, darling, forgive me!\u201d\n\nBut the countess pushed her daughter away and went up to her husband.\n\n\u201cMy dear, you order what is right.... You know I don\u2019t understand about it,\u201d said she, dropping her eyes shamefacedly.\n\n\u201cThe eggs... the eggs are teaching the hen,\u201d muttered the count through tears of joy, and he embraced his wife who was glad to hide her look of shame on his breast.\n\n\u201cPapa! Mamma! May I see to it? May I?...\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cWe will still take all the most necessary things.\u201d\n\nThe count nodded affirmatively, and Nat\u00e1sha, at the rapid pace at which she used to run when playing at tag, ran through the ballroom to the anteroom and downstairs into the yard.\n\nThe servants gathered round Nat\u00e1sha, but could not believe the strange order she brought them until the count himself, in his wife\u2019s name, confirmed the order to give up all the carts to the wounded and take the trunks to the storerooms. When they understood that order the servants set to work at this new task with pleasure and zeal. It no longer seemed strange to them but on the contrary it seemed the only thing that could be done, just as a quarter of an hour before it had not seemed strange to anyone that the wounded should be left behind and the goods carted away but that had seemed the only thing to do.\n\nThe whole household, as if to atone for not having done it sooner, set eagerly to work at the new task of placing the wounded in the carts. The wounded dragged themselves out of their rooms and stood with pale but happy faces round the carts. The news that carts were to be had spread to the neighboring houses, from which wounded men began to come into the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 yard. Many of the wounded asked them not to unload the carts but only to let them sit on the top of the things. But the work of unloading, once started, could not be arrested. It seemed not to matter whether all or only half the things were left behind. Cases full of china, bronzes, pictures, and mirrors that had been so carefully packed the night before now lay about the yard, and still they went on searching for and finding possibilities of unloading this or that and letting the wounded have another and yet another cart.\n\n\u201cWe can take four more men,\u201d said the steward. \u201cThey can have my trap, or else what is to become of them?\u201d\n\n\u201cLet them have my wardrobe cart,\u201d said the countess. \u201cDuny\u00e1sha can go with me in the carriage.\u201d\n\nThey unloaded the wardrobe cart and sent it to take wounded men from a house two doors off. The whole household, servants included, was bright and animated. Nat\u00e1sha was in a state of rapturous excitement such as she had not known for a long time.\n\n\u201cWhat could we fasten this onto?\u201d asked the servants, trying to fix a trunk on the narrow footboard behind a carriage. \u201cWe must keep at least one cart.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in it?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cThe count\u2019s books.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it, Vas\u00edlich will put it away. It\u2019s not wanted.\u201d\n\nThe phaeton was full of people and there was a doubt as to where Count Peter could sit.\n\n\u201cOn the box. You\u2019ll sit on the box, won\u2019t you, P\u00e9tya?\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nS\u00f3nya too was busy all this time, but the aim of her efforts was quite different from Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s. She was putting away the things that had to be left behind and making a list of them as the countess wished, and she tried to get as much taken away with them as possible.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nBefore two o\u2019clock in the afternoon the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 four carriages, packed full and with the horses harnessed, stood at the front door. One by one the carts with the wounded had moved out of the yard.\n\nThe cal\u00e8che in which Prince Andrew was being taken attracted S\u00f3nya\u2019s attention as it passed the front porch. With the help of a maid she was arranging a seat for the countess in the huge high coach that stood at the entrance.\n\n\u201cWhose cal\u00e8che is that?\u201d she inquired, leaning out of the carriage window.\n\n\u201cWhy, didn\u2019t you know, Miss?\u201d replied the maid. \u201cThe wounded prince: he spent the night in our house and is going with us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut who is it? What\u2019s his name?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s our intended that was\u2014Prince Bolk\u00f3nski himself! They say he is dying,\u201d replied the maid with a sigh.\n\nS\u00f3nya jumped out of the coach and ran to the countess. The countess, tired out and already dressed in shawl and bonnet for her journey, was pacing up and down the drawing room, waiting for the household to assemble for the usual silent prayer with closed doors before starting. Nat\u00e1sha was not in the room.\n\n\u201cMamma,\u201d said S\u00f3nya, \u201cPrince Andrew is here, mortally wounded. He is going with us.\u201d\n\nThe countess opened her eyes in dismay and, seizing S\u00f3nya\u2019s arm, glanced around.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha?\u201d she murmured.\n\nAt that moment this news had only one significance for both of them. They knew their Nat\u00e1sha, and alarm as to what would happen if she heard this news stifled all sympathy for the man they both liked.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha does not know yet, but he is going with us,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cYou say he is dying?\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya nodded.\n\nThe countess put her arms around S\u00f3nya and began to cry.\n\n\u201cThe ways of God are past finding out!\u201d she thought, feeling that the Almighty Hand, hitherto unseen, was becoming manifest in all that was now taking place.\n\n\u201cWell, Mamma? Everything is ready. What\u2019s the matter?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha, as with animated face she ran into the room.\n\n\u201cNothing,\u201d answered the countess. \u201cIf everything is ready let us start.\u201d\n\nAnd the countess bent over her reticule to hide her agitated face. S\u00f3nya embraced Nat\u00e1sha and kissed her.\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at her inquiringly.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? What has happened?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing... No...\u201d\n\n\u201cIs it something very bad for me? What is it?\u201d persisted Nat\u00e1sha with her quick intuition.\n\nS\u00f3nya sighed and made no reply. The count, P\u00e9tya, Madame Schoss, M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, and Vas\u00edlich came into the drawing room and, having closed the doors, they all sat down and remained for some moments silently seated without looking at one another.\n\nThe count was the first to rise, and with a loud sigh crossed himself before the icon. All the others did the same. Then the count embraced M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna and Vas\u00edlich, who were to remain in Moscow, and while they caught at his hand and kissed his shoulder he patted their backs lightly with some vaguely affectionate and comforting words. The countess went into the oratory and there S\u00f3nya found her on her knees before the icons that had been left here and there hanging on the wall. (The most precious ones, with which some family tradition was connected, were being taken with them.)\n\nIn the porch and in the yard the men whom P\u00e9tya had armed with swords and daggers, with trousers tucked inside their high boots and with belts and girdles tightened, were taking leave of those remaining behind.\n\nAs is always the case at a departure, much had been forgotten or put in the wrong place, and for a long time two menservants stood one on each side of the open door and the carriage steps waiting to help the countess in, while maids rushed with cushions and bundles from the house to the carriages, the cal\u00e8che, the phaeton, and back again.\n\n\u201cThey always will forget everything!\u201d said the countess. \u201cDon\u2019t you know I can\u2019t sit like that?\u201d\n\nAnd Duny\u00e1sha, with clenched teeth, without replying but with an aggrieved look on her face, hastily got into the coach to rearrange the seat.\n\n\u201cOh, those servants!\u201d said the count, swaying his head.\n\nEf\u00edm, the old coachman, who was the only one the countess trusted to drive her, sat perched up high on the box and did not so much as glance round at what was going on behind him. From thirty years\u2019 experience he knew it would be some time yet before the order, \u201cBe off, in God\u2019s name!\u201d would be given him: and he knew that even when it was said he would be stopped once or twice more while they sent back to fetch something that had been forgotten, and even after that he would again be stopped and the countess herself would lean out of the window and beg him for the love of heaven to drive carefully down the hill. He knew all this and therefore waited calmly for what would happen, with more patience than the horses, especially the near one, the chestnut Falcon, who was pawing the ground and champing his bit. At last all were seated, the carriage steps were folded and pulled up, the door was shut, somebody was sent for a traveling case, and the countess leaned out and said what she had to say. Then Ef\u00edm deliberately doffed his hat and began crossing himself. The postilion and all the other servants did the same. \u201cOff, in God\u2019s name!\u201d said Ef\u00edm, putting on his hat. \u201cStart!\u201d The postilion started the horses, the off pole horse tugged at his collar, the high springs creaked, and the body of the coach swayed. The footman sprang onto the box of the moving coach which jolted as it passed out of the yard onto the uneven roadway; the other vehicles jolted in their turn, and the procession of carriages moved up the street. In the carriages, the cal\u00e8che, and the phaeton, all crossed themselves as they passed the church opposite the house. Those who were to remain in Moscow walked on either side of the vehicles seeing the travelers off.\n\nRarely had Nat\u00e1sha experienced so joyful a feeling as now, sitting in the carriage beside the countess and gazing at the slowly receding walls of forsaken, agitated Moscow. Occasionally she leaned out of the carriage window and looked back and then forward at the long train of wounded in front of them. Almost at the head of the line she could see the raised hood of Prince Andrew\u2019s cal\u00e8che. She did not know who was in it, but each time she looked at the procession her eyes sought that cal\u00e8che. She knew it was right in front.\n\nIn K\u00fadrino, from the Nik\u00edtski, Pr\u00e9snya, and Podnov\u00ednsk Streets came several other trains of vehicles similar to the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019, and as they passed along the Sad\u00f3vaya Street the carriages and carts formed two rows abreast.\n\nAs they were going round the S\u00fakharev water tower Nat\u00e1sha, who was inquisitively and alertly scrutinizing the people driving or walking past, suddenly cried out in joyful surprise:\n\n\u201cDear me! Mamma, S\u00f3nya, look, it\u2019s he!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho? Who?\u201d\n\n\u201cLook! Yes, on my word, it\u2019s Bez\u00fakhov!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, putting her head out of the carriage and staring at a tall, stout man in a coachman\u2019s long coat, who from his manner of walking and moving was evidently a gentleman in disguise, and who was passing under the arch of the S\u00fakharev tower accompanied by a small, sallow-faced, beardless old man in a frieze coat.\n\n\u201cYes, it really is Bez\u00fakhov in a coachman\u2019s coat, with a queer-looking old boy. Really,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, \u201clook, look!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not he. How can you talk such nonsense?\u201d\n\n\u201cMamma,\u201d screamed Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cI\u2019ll stake my head it\u2019s he! I assure you! Stop, stop!\u201d she cried to the coachman.\n\nBut the coachman could not stop, for from the Meshch\u00e1nski Street came more carts and carriages, and the Rost\u00f3vs were being shouted at to move on and not block the way.\n\nIn fact, however, though now much farther off than before, the Rost\u00f3vs all saw Pierre\u2014or someone extraordinarily like him\u2014in a coachman\u2019s coat, going down the street with head bent and a serious face beside a small, beardless old man who looked like a footman. That old man noticed a face thrust out of the carriage window gazing at them, and respectfully touching Pierre\u2019s elbow said something to him and pointed to the carriage. Pierre, evidently engrossed in thought, could not at first understand him. At length when he had understood and looked in the direction the old man indicated, he recognized Nat\u00e1sha, and following his first impulse stepped instantly and rapidly toward the coach. But having taken a dozen steps he seemed to remember something and stopped.\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, leaning out of the window, beamed with quizzical kindliness.\n\n\u201cPeter Kir\u00edlovich, come here! We have recognized you! This is wonderful!\u201d she cried, holding out her hand to him. \u201cWhat are you doing? Why are you like this?\u201d\n\nPierre took her outstretched hand and kissed it awkwardly as he walked along beside her while the coach still moved on.\n\n\u201cWhat is the matter, Count?\u201d asked the countess in a surprised and commiserating tone.\n\n\u201cWhat? What? Why? Don\u2019t ask me,\u201d said Pierre, and looked round at Nat\u00e1sha whose radiant, happy expression\u2014of which he was conscious without looking at her\u2014filled him with enchantment.\n\n\u201cAre you remaining in Moscow, then?\u201d\n\nPierre hesitated.\n\n\u201cIn Moscow?\u201d he said in a questioning tone. \u201cYes, in Moscow. Good-by!\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, if only I were a man! I\u2019d certainly stay with you. How splendid!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cMamma, if you\u2019ll let me, I\u2019ll stay!\u201d\n\nPierre glanced absently at Nat\u00e1sha and was about to say something, but the countess interrupted him.\n\n\u201cYou were at the battle, we heard.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I was,\u201d Pierre answered. \u201cThere will be another battle tomorrow...\u201d he began, but Nat\u00e1sha interrupted him.\n\n\u201cBut what is the matter with you, Count? You are not like yourself....\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, don\u2019t ask me, don\u2019t ask me! I don\u2019t know myself. Tomorrow... But no! Good-by, good-by!\u201d he muttered. \u201cIt\u2019s an awful time!\u201d and dropping behind the carriage he stepped onto the pavement.\n\nNat\u00e1sha continued to lean out of the window for a long time, beaming at him with her kindly, slightly quizzical, happy smile.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nFor the last two days, ever since leaving home, Pierre had been living in the empty house of his deceased benefactor, Bazd\u00e9ev. This is how it happened.\n\nWhen he woke up on the morning after his return to Moscow and his interview with Count Rostopch\u00edn, he could not for some time make out where he was and what was expected of him. When he was informed that among others awaiting him in his reception room there was a Frenchman who had brought a letter from his wife, the Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, he felt suddenly overcome by that sense of confusion and hopelessness to which he was apt to succumb. He felt that everything was now at an end, all was in confusion and crumbling to pieces, that nobody was right or wrong, the future held nothing, and there was no escape from this position. Smiling unnaturally and muttering to himself, he first sat down on the sofa in an attitude of despair, then rose, went to the door of the reception room and peeped through the crack, returned flourishing his arms, and took up a book. His major-domo came in a second time to say that the Frenchman who had brought the letter from the countess was very anxious to see him if only for a minute, and that someone from Bazd\u00e9ev\u2019s widow had called to ask Pierre to take charge of her husband\u2019s books, as she herself was leaving for the country.\n\n\u201cOh, yes, in a minute; wait... or no! No, of course... go and say I will come directly,\u201d Pierre replied to the major-domo.\n\nBut as soon as the man had left the room Pierre took up his hat which was lying on the table and went out of his study by the other door. There was no one in the passage. He went along the whole length of this passage to the stairs and, frowning and rubbing his forehead with both hands, went down as far as the first landing. The hall porter was standing at the front door. From the landing where Pierre stood there was a second staircase leading to the back entrance. He went down that staircase and out into the yard. No one had seen him. But there were some carriages waiting, and as soon as Pierre stepped out of the gate the coachmen and the yard porter noticed him and raised their caps to him. When he felt he was being looked at he behaved like an ostrich which hides its head in a bush in order not to be seen: he hung his head and quickening his pace went down the street.\n\nOf all the affairs awaiting Pierre that day the sorting of Joseph Bazd\u00e9ev\u2019s books and papers appeared to him the most necessary.\n\nHe hired the first cab he met and told the driver to go to the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds, where the widow Bazd\u00e9ev\u2019s house was.\n\nContinually turning round to look at the rows of loaded carts that were making their way from all sides out of Moscow, and balancing his bulky body so as not to slip out of the ramshackle old vehicle, Pierre, experiencing the joyful feeling of a boy escaping from school, began to talk to his driver.\n\nThe man told him that arms were being distributed today at the Kr\u00e9mlin and that tomorrow everyone would be sent out beyond the Three Hills gates and a great battle would be fought there.\n\nHaving reached the Patriarch\u2019s Ponds Pierre found the Bazd\u00e9evs\u2019 house, where he had not been for a long time past. He went up to the gate. Ger\u00e1sim, that sallow beardless old man Pierre had seen at Torzh\u00f3k five years before with Joseph Bazd\u00e9ev, came out in answer to his knock.\n\n\u201cAt home?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cOwing to the present state of things Sophia Dan\u00edlovna has gone to the Torzh\u00f3k estate with the children, your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will come in all the same, I have to look through the books,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cBe so good as to step in. Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich, the brother of my late master\u2014may the kingdom of heaven be his\u2014has remained here, but he is in a weak state as you know,\u201d said the old servant.\n\nPierre knew that Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich was Joseph Bazd\u00e9ev\u2019s half-insane brother and a hard drinker.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, I know. Let us go in...\u201d said Pierre and entered the house.\n\nA tall, bald-headed old man with a red nose, wearing a dressing gown and with galoshes on his bare feet, stood in the anteroom. On seeing Pierre he muttered something angrily and went away along the passage.\n\n\u201cHe was a very clever man but has now grown quite feeble, as your honor sees,\u201d said Ger\u00e1sim. \u201cWill you step into the study?\u201d Pierre nodded. \u201cAs it was sealed up so it has remained, but Sophia Dan\u00edlovna gave orders that if anyone should come from you they were to have the books.\u201d\n\nPierre went into that gloomy study which he had entered with such trepidation in his benefactor\u2019s lifetime. The room, dusty and untouched since the death of Joseph Bazd\u00e9ev was now even gloomier.\n\nGer\u00e1sim opened one of the shutters and left the room on tiptoe. Pierre went round the study, approached the cupboard in which the manuscripts were kept, and took out what had once been one of the most important, the holy of holies of the order. This was the authentic Scotch Acts with Bazd\u00e9ev\u2019s notes and explanations. He sat down at the dusty writing table, and, having laid the manuscripts before him, opened them out, closed them, finally pushed them away, and resting his head on his hand sank into meditation.\n\nGer\u00e1sim looked cautiously into the study several times and saw Pierre always sitting in the same attitude.\n\nMore than two hours passed and Ger\u00e1sim took the liberty of making a slight noise at the door to attract his attention, but Pierre did not hear him.\n\n\u201cIs the cabman to be discharged, your honor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes!\u201d said Pierre, rousing himself and rising hurriedly. \u201cLook here,\u201d he added, taking Ger\u00e1sim by a button of his coat and looking down at the old man with moist, shining, and ecstatic eyes, \u201cI say, do you know that there is going to be a battle tomorrow?\u201d\n\n\u201cWe heard so,\u201d replied the man.\n\n\u201cI beg you not to tell anyone who I am, and to do what I ask you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency,\u201d replied Ger\u00e1sim. \u201cWill you have something to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, but I want something else. I want peasant clothes and a pistol,\u201d said Pierre, unexpectedly blushing.\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency,\u201d said Ger\u00e1sim after thinking for a moment.\n\nAll the rest of that day Pierre spent alone in his benefactor\u2019s study, and Ger\u00e1sim heard him pacing restlessly from one corner to another and talking to himself. And he spent the night on a bed made up for him there.\n\nGer\u00e1sim, being a servant who in his time had seen many strange things, accepted Pierre\u2019s taking up his residence in the house without surprise, and seemed pleased to have someone to wait on. That same evening\u2014without even asking himself what they were wanted for\u2014he procured a coachman\u2019s coat and cap for Pierre, and promised to get him the pistol next day. Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich came twice that evening shuffling along in his galoshes as far as the door and stopped and looked ingratiatingly at Pierre. But as soon as Pierre turned toward him he wrapped his dressing gown around him with a shamefaced and angry look and hurried away. It was when Pierre (wearing the coachman\u2019s coat which Ger\u00e1sim had procured for him and had disinfected by steam) was on his way with the old man to buy the pistol at the S\u00fakharev market that he met the Rost\u00f3vs.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s order to retreat through Moscow to the Ryaz\u00e1n road was issued at night on the first of September.\n\nThe first troops started at once, and during the night they marched slowly and steadily without hurry. At daybreak, however, those nearing the town at the Dorogom\u00edlov bridge saw ahead of them masses of soldiers crowding and hurrying across the bridge, ascending on the opposite side and blocking the streets and alleys, while endless masses of troops were bearing down on them from behind, and an unreasoning hurry and alarm overcame them. They all rushed forward to the bridge, onto it, and to the fords and the boats. Kut\u00fazov himself had driven round by side streets to the other side of Moscow.\n\nBy ten o\u2019clock in the morning of the second of September, only the rear guard remained in the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb, where they had ample room. The main army was on the other side of Moscow or beyond it.\n\nAt that very time, at ten in the morning of the second of September, Napoleon was standing among his troops on the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill looking at the panorama spread out before him. From the twenty-sixth of August to the second of September, that is from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the entry of the French into Moscow, during the whole of that agitating, memorable week, there had been the extraordinary autumn weather that always comes as a surprise, when the sun hangs low and gives more heat than in spring, when everything shines so brightly in the rare clear atmosphere that the eyes smart, when the lungs are strengthened and refreshed by inhaling the aromatic autumn air, when even the nights are warm, and when in those dark warm nights, golden stars startle and delight us continually by falling from the sky.\n\nAt ten in the morning of the second of September this weather still held.\n\nThe brightness of the morning was magical. Moscow seen from the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill lay spaciously spread out with her river, her gardens, and her churches, and she seemed to be living her usual life, her cupolas glittering like stars in the sunlight.\n\nThe view of the strange city with its peculiar architecture, such as he had never seen before, filled Napoleon with the rather envious and uneasy curiosity men feel when they see an alien form of life that has no knowledge of them. This city was evidently living with the full force of its own life. By the indefinite signs which, even at a distance, distinguish a living body from a dead one, Napoleon from the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill perceived the throb of life in the town and felt, as it were, the breathing of that great and beautiful body.\n\nEvery Russian looking at Moscow feels her to be a mother; every foreigner who sees her, even if ignorant of her significance as the mother city, must feel her feminine character, and Napoleon felt it.\n\n\u201cCette ville asiatique aux innombrables \u00e9glises, Moscou la sainte. La voil\u00e0 donc enfin, cette fameuse ville! Il \u00e9tait temps,\u201d said he, and dismounting he ordered a plan of Moscow to be spread out before him, and summoned Lelorgne d\u2019Ideville, the interpreter.\n\n\u201cA town captured by the enemy is like a maid who has lost her honor,\u201d thought he (he had said so to T\u00fachkov at Smol\u00e9nsk). From that point of view he gazed at the Oriental beauty he had not seen before. It seemed strange to him that his long-felt wish, which had seemed unattainable, had at last been realized. In the clear morning light he gazed now at the city and now at the plan, considering its details, and the assurance of possessing it agitated and awed him.\n\n\u201cBut could it be otherwise?\u201d he thought. \u201cHere is this capital at my feet. Where is Alexander now, and of what is he thinking? A strange, beautiful, and majestic city; and a strange and majestic moment! In what light must I appear to them!\u201d thought he, thinking of his troops. \u201cHere she is, the reward for all those fainthearted men,\u201d he reflected, glancing at those near him and at the troops who were approaching and forming up. \u201cOne word from me, one movement of my hand, and that ancient capital of the Tsars would perish. But my clemency is always ready to descend upon the vanquished. I must be magnanimous and truly great. But no, it can\u2019t be true that I am in Moscow,\u201d he suddenly thought. \u201cYet here she is lying at my feet, with her golden domes and crosses scintillating and twinkling in the sunshine. But I shall spare her. On the ancient monuments of barbarism and despotism I will inscribe great words of justice and mercy.... It is just this which Alexander will feel most painfully, I know him.\u201d (It seemed to Napoleon that the chief import of what was taking place lay in the personal struggle between himself and Alexander.) \u201cFrom the height of the Kr\u00e9mlin\u2014yes, there is the Kr\u00e9mlin, yes\u2014I will give them just laws; I will teach them the meaning of true civilization, I will make generations of boyars remember their conqueror with love. I will tell the deputation that I did not, and do not, desire war, that I have waged war only against the false policy of their court; that I love and respect Alexander and that in Moscow I will accept terms of peace worthy of myself and of my people. I do not wish to utilize the fortunes of war to humiliate an honored monarch. \u2018Boyars,\u2019 I will say to them, \u2018I do not desire war, I desire the peace and welfare of all my subjects.\u2019 However, I know their presence will inspire me, and I shall speak to them as I always do: clearly, impressively, and majestically. But can it be true that I am in Moscow? Yes, there she lies.\u201d\n\n\u201cQu\u2019on m\u2019am\u00e8ne les boyars,\u201d said he to his suite.\n\nA general with a brilliant suite galloped off at once to fetch the boyars.\n\nTwo hours passed. Napoleon had lunched and was again standing in the same place on the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill awaiting the deputation. His speech to the boyars had already taken definite shape in his imagination. That speech was full of dignity and greatness as Napoleon understood it.\n\nHe was himself carried away by the tone of magnanimity he intended to adopt toward Moscow. In his imagination he appointed days for assemblies at the palace of the Tsars, at which Russian notables and his own would mingle. He mentally appointed a governor, one who would win the hearts of the people. Having learned that there were many charitable institutions in Moscow he mentally decided that he would shower favors on them all. He thought that, as in Africa he had to put on a burnoose and sit in a mosque, so in Moscow he must be beneficent like the Tsars. And in order finally to touch the hearts of the Russians\u2014and being like all Frenchmen unable to imagine anything sentimental without a reference to ma ch\u00e8re, ma tendre, ma pauvre m\u00e8re\u2014he decided that he would place an inscription on all these establishments in large letters: \u201cThis establishment is dedicated to my dear mother.\u201d Or no, it should be simply: Maison de ma M\u00e8re, he concluded. \u201cBut am I really in Moscow? Yes, here it lies before me, but why is the deputation from the city so long in appearing?\u201d he wondered.\n\nMeanwhile an agitated consultation was being carried on in whispers among his generals and marshals at the rear of his suite. Those sent to fetch the deputation had returned with the news that Moscow was empty, that everyone had left it. The faces of those who were not conferring together were pale and perturbed. They were not alarmed by the fact that Moscow had been abandoned by its inhabitants (grave as that fact seemed), but by the question how to tell the Emperor\u2014without putting him in the terrible position of appearing ridiculous\u2014that he had been awaiting the boyars so long in vain: that there were drunken mobs left in Moscow but no one else. Some said that a deputation of some sort must be scraped together, others disputed that opinion and maintained that the Emperor should first be carefully and skillfully prepared, and then told the truth.\n\n\u201cHe will have to be told, all the same,\u201d said some gentlemen of the suite. \u201cBut, gentlemen...\u201d\n\nThe position was the more awkward because the Emperor, meditating upon his magnanimous plans, was pacing patiently up and down before the outspread map, occasionally glancing along the road to Moscow from under his lifted hand with a bright and proud smile.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s impossible...\u201d declared the gentlemen of the suite, shrugging their shoulders but not venturing to utter the implied word\u2014le ridicule....\n\nAt last the Emperor, tired of futile expectation, his actor\u2019s instinct suggesting to him that the sublime moment having been too long drawn out was beginning to lose its sublimity, gave a sign with his hand. A single report of a signaling gun followed, and the troops, who were already spread out on different sides of Moscow, moved into the city through the Tver, Kal\u00faga, and Dorogom\u00edlov gates. Faster and faster, vying with one another, they moved at the double or at a trot, vanishing amid the clouds of dust they raised and making the air ring with a deafening roar of mingling shouts.\n\nDrawn on by the movement of his troops Napoleon rode with them as far as the Dorogom\u00edlov gate, but there again stopped and, dismounting from his horse, paced for a long time by the K\u00e1mmer-Koll\u00e9zski rampart, awaiting the deputation.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nMeanwhile Moscow was empty. There were still people in it, perhaps a fiftieth part of its former inhabitants had remained, but it was empty. It was empty in the sense that a dying queenless hive is empty.\n\nIn a queenless hive no life is left though to a superficial glance it seems as much alive as other hives.\n\nThe bees circle round a queenless hive in the hot beams of the midday sun as gaily as around the living hives; from a distance it smells of honey like the others, and bees fly in and out in the same way. But one has only to observe that hive to realize that there is no longer any life in it. The bees do not fly in the same way, the smell and the sound that meet the beekeeper are not the same. To the beekeeper\u2019s tap on the wall of the sick hive, instead of the former instant unanimous humming of tens of thousands of bees with their abdomens threateningly compressed, and producing by the rapid vibration of their wings an aerial living sound, the only reply is a disconnected buzzing from different parts of the deserted hive. From the alighting board, instead of the former spirituous fragrant smell of honey and venom, and the warm whiffs of crowded life, comes an odor of emptiness and decay mingling with the smell of honey. There are no longer sentinels sounding the alarm with their abdomens raised, and ready to die in defense of the hive. There is no longer the measured quiet sound of throbbing activity, like the sound of boiling water, but diverse discordant sounds of disorder. In and out of the hive long black robber bees smeared with honey fly timidly and shiftily. They do not sting, but crawl away from danger. Formerly only bees laden with honey flew into the hive, and they flew out empty; now they fly out laden. The beekeeper opens the lower part of the hive and peers in. Instead of black, glossy bees\u2014tamed by toil, clinging to one another\u2019s legs and drawing out the wax, with a ceaseless hum of labor\u2014that used to hang in long clusters down to the floor of the hive, drowsy shriveled bees crawl about separately in various directions on the floor and walls of the hive. Instead of a neatly glued floor, swept by the bees with the fanning of their wings, there is a floor littered with bits of wax, excrement, dying bees scarcely moving their legs, and dead ones that have not been cleared away.\n\nThe beekeeper opens the upper part of the hive and examines the super. Instead of serried rows of bees sealing up every gap in the combs and keeping the brood warm, he sees the skillful complex structures of the combs, but no longer in their former state of purity. All is neglected and foul. Black robber bees are swiftly and stealthily prowling about the combs, and the short home bees, shriveled and listless as if they were old, creep slowly about without trying to hinder the robbers, having lost all motive and all sense of life. Drones, bumblebees, wasps, and butterflies knock awkwardly against the walls of the hive in their flight. Here and there among the cells containing dead brood and honey an angry buzzing can sometimes be heard. Here and there a couple of bees, by force of habit and custom cleaning out the brood cells, with efforts beyond their strength laboriously drag away a dead bee or bumblebee without knowing why they do it. In another corner two old bees are languidly fighting, or cleaning themselves, or feeding one another, without themselves knowing whether they do it with friendly or hostile intent. In a third place a crowd of bees, crushing one another, attack some victim and fight and smother it, and the victim, enfeebled or killed, drops from above slowly and lightly as a feather, among the heap of corpses. The keeper opens the two center partitions to examine the brood cells. In place of the former close dark circles formed by thousands of bees sitting back to back and guarding the high mystery of generation, he sees hundreds of dull, listless, and sleepy shells of bees. They have almost all died unawares, sitting in the sanctuary they had guarded and which is now no more. They reek of decay and death. Only a few of them still move, rise, and feebly fly to settle on the enemy\u2019s hand, lacking the spirit to die stinging him; the rest are dead and fall as lightly as fish scales. The beekeeper closes the hive, chalks a mark on it, and when he has time tears out its contents and burns it clean.\n\nSo in the same way Moscow was empty when Napoleon, weary, uneasy, and morose, paced up and down in front of the K\u00e1mmer-Koll\u00e9zski rampart, awaiting what to his mind was a necessary, if but formal, observance of the proprieties\u2014a deputation.\n\nIn various corners of Moscow there still remained a few people aimlessly moving about, following their old habits and hardly aware of what they were doing.\n\nWhen with due circumspection Napoleon was informed that Moscow was empty, he looked angrily at his informant, turned away, and silently continued to walk to and fro.\n\n\u201cMy carriage!\u201d he said.\n\nHe took his seat beside the aide-de-camp on duty and drove into the suburb. \u201cMoscow deserted!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhat an incredible event!\u201d\n\nHe did not drive into the town, but put up at an inn in the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb.\n\nThe coup de th\u00e9\u00e2tre had not come off.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXI\n\nThe Russian troops were passing through Moscow from two o\u2019clock at night till two in the afternoon and bore away with them the wounded and the last of the inhabitants who were leaving.\n\nThe greatest crush during the movement of the troops took place at the Stone, Moskv\u00e1, and Ya\u00faza bridges.\n\nWhile the troops, dividing into two parts when passing around the Kr\u00e9mlin, were thronging the Moskv\u00e1 and the Stone bridges, a great many soldiers, taking advantage of the stoppage and congestion, turned back from the bridges and slipped stealthily and silently past the church of Vas\u00edli the Beatified and under the Borov\u00edtski gate, back up the hill to the Red Square where some instinct told them they could easily take things not belonging to them. Crowds of the kind seen at cheap sales filled all the passages and alleys of the Bazaar. But there were no dealers with voices of ingratiating affability inviting customers to enter; there were no hawkers, nor the usual motley crowd of female purchasers\u2014but only soldiers, in uniforms and overcoats though without muskets, entering the Bazaar empty-handed and silently making their way out through its passages with bundles. Tradesmen and their assistants (of whom there were but few) moved about among the soldiers quite bewildered. They unlocked their shops and locked them up again, and themselves carried goods away with the help of their assistants. On the square in front of the Bazaar were drummers beating the muster call. But the roll of the drums did not make the looting soldiers run in the direction of the drum as formerly, but made them, on the contrary, run farther away. Among the soldiers in the shops and passages some men were to be seen in gray coats, with closely shaven heads. Two officers, one with a scarf over his uniform and mounted on a lean, dark-gray horse, the other in an overcoat and on foot, stood at the corner of Ily\u00ednka Street, talking. A third officer gal", "sequence": 22}, {"offset": 2300000, "text": "loped up to them.\n\n\u201cThe general orders them all to be driven out at once, without fail. This is outrageous! Half the men have dispersed.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere are you off to?... Where?...\u201d he shouted to three infantrymen without muskets who, holding up the skirts of their overcoats, were slipping past him into the Bazaar passage. \u201cStop, you rascals!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut how are you going to stop them?\u201d replied another officer. \u201cThere is no getting them together. The army should push on before the rest bolt, that\u2019s all!\u201d\n\n\u201cHow can one push on? They are stuck there, wedged on the bridge, and don\u2019t move. Shouldn\u2019t we put a cordon round to prevent the rest from running away?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, go in there and drive them out!\u201d shouted the senior officer.\n\nThe officer in the scarf dismounted, called up a drummer, and went with him into the arcade. Some soldiers started running away in a group. A shopkeeper with red pimples on his cheeks near the nose, and a calm, persistent, calculating expression on his plump face, hurriedly and ostentatiously approached the officer, swinging his arms.\n\n\u201cYour honor!\u201d said he. \u201cBe so good as to protect us! We won\u2019t grudge trifles, you are welcome to anything\u2014we shall be delighted! Pray!... I\u2019ll fetch a piece of cloth at once for such an honorable gentleman, or even two pieces with pleasure. For we feel how it is; but what\u2019s all this\u2014sheer robbery! If you please, could not guards be placed if only to let us close the shop....\u201d\n\nSeveral shopkeepers crowded round the officer.\n\n\u201cEh, what twaddle!\u201d said one of them, a thin, stern-looking man. \u201cWhen one\u2019s head is gone one doesn\u2019t weep for one\u2019s hair! Take what any of you like!\u201d And flourishing his arm energetically he turned sideways to the officer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all very well for you, Iv\u00e1n Sid\u00f3rych, to talk,\u201d said the first tradesman angrily. \u201cPlease step inside, your honor!\u201d\n\n\u201cTalk indeed!\u201d cried the thin one. \u201cIn my three shops here I have a hundred thousand rubles\u2019 worth of goods. Can they be saved when the army has gone? Eh, what people! \u2018Against God\u2019s might our hands can\u2019t fight.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cCome inside, your honor!\u201d repeated the tradesman, bowing.\n\nThe officer stood perplexed and his face showed indecision.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not my business!\u201d he exclaimed, and strode on quickly down one of the passages.\n\nFrom one open shop came the sound of blows and vituperation, and just as the officer came up to it a man in a gray coat with a shaven head was flung out violently.\n\nThis man, bent double, rushed past the tradesman and the officer. The officer pounced on the soldiers who were in the shops, but at that moment fearful screams reached them from the huge crowd on the Moskv\u00e1 bridge and the officer ran out into the square.\n\n\u201cWhat is it? What is it?\u201d he asked, but his comrade was already galloping off past Vas\u00edli the Beatified in the direction from which the screams came.\n\nThe officer mounted his horse and rode after him. When he reached the bridge he saw two unlimbered guns, the infantry crossing the bridge, several overturned carts, and frightened and laughing faces among the troops. Beside the cannon a cart was standing to which two horses were harnessed. Four borzois with collars were pressing close to the wheels. The cart was loaded high, and at the very top, beside a child\u2019s chair with its legs in the air, sat a peasant woman uttering piercing and desperate shrieks. He was told by his fellow officers that the screams of the crowd and the shrieks of the woman were due to the fact that General Erm\u00f3lov, coming up to the crowd and learning that soldiers were dispersing among the shops while crowds of civilians blocked the bridge, had ordered two guns to be unlimbered and made a show of firing at the bridge. The crowd, crushing one another, upsetting carts, and shouting and squeezing desperately, had cleared off the bridge and the troops were now moving forward.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXII\n\nMeanwhile, the city itself was deserted. There was hardly anyone in the streets. The gates and shops were all closed, only here and there round the taverns solitary shouts or drunken songs could be heard. Nobody drove through the streets and footsteps were rarely heard. The Povarsk\u00e1ya was quite still and deserted. The huge courtyard of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house was littered with wisps of hay and with dung from the horses, and not a soul was to be seen there. In the great drawing room of the house, which had been left with all it contained, were two people. They were the yard porter Ign\u00e1t, and the page boy M\u00edshka, Vas\u00edlich\u2019s grandson who had stayed in Moscow with his grandfather. M\u00edshka had opened the clavichord and was strumming on it with one finger. The yard porter, his arms akimbo, stood smiling with satisfaction before the large mirror.\n\n\u201cIsn\u2019t it fine, eh, Uncle Ign\u00e1t?\u201d said the boy, suddenly beginning to strike the keyboard with both hands.\n\n\u201cOnly fancy!\u201d answered Ign\u00e1t, surprised at the broadening grin on his face in the mirror.\n\n\u201cImpudence! Impudence!\u201d they heard behind them the voice of M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna who had entered silently. \u201cHow he\u2019s grinning, the fat mug! Is that what you\u2019re here for? Nothing\u2019s cleared away down there and Vas\u00edlich is worn out. Just you wait a bit!\u201d\n\nIgn\u00e1t left off smiling, adjusted his belt, and went out of the room with meekly downcast eyes.\n\n\u201cAunt, I did it gently,\u201d said the boy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you something gently, you monkey you!\u201d cried M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna, raising her arm threateningly. \u201cGo and get the samovar to boil for your grandfather.\u201d\n\nM\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna flicked the dust off the clavichord and closed it, and with a deep sigh left the drawing room and locked its main door.\n\nGoing out into the yard she paused to consider where she should go next\u2014to drink tea in the servants\u2019 wing with Vas\u00edlich, or into the storeroom to put away what still lay about.\n\nShe heard the sound of quick footsteps in the quiet street. Someone stopped at the gate, and the latch rattled as someone tried to open it. M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna went to the gate.\n\n\u201cWho do you want?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe count\u2014Count Ily\u00e1 Andr\u00e9evich Rost\u00f3v.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd who are you?\u201d\n\n\u201cAn officer, I have to see him,\u201d came the reply in a pleasant, well-bred Russian voice.\n\nM\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna opened the gate and an officer of eighteen, with the round face of a Rost\u00f3v, entered the yard.\n\n\u201cThey have gone away, sir. Went away yesterday at vespertime,\u201d said M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna cordially.\n\nThe young officer standing in the gateway, as if hesitating whether to enter or not, clicked his tongue.\n\n\u201cAh, how annoying!\u201d he muttered. \u201cI should have come yesterday.... Ah, what a pity.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna was attentively and sympathetically examining the familiar Rost\u00f3v features of the young man\u2019s face, his tattered coat and trodden-down boots.\n\n\u201cWhat did you want to see the count for?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cOh well... it can\u2019t be helped!\u201d said he in a tone of vexation and placed his hand on the gate as if to leave.\n\nHe again paused in indecision.\n\n\u201cYou see,\u201d he suddenly said, \u201cI am a kinsman of the count\u2019s and he has been very kind to me. As you see\u201d (he glanced with an amused air and good-natured smile at his coat and boots) \u201cmy things are worn out and I have no money, so I was going to ask the count...\u201d\n\nM\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna did not let him finish.\n\n\u201cJust wait a minute, sir. One little moment,\u201d said she.\n\nAnd as soon as the officer let go of the gate handle she turned and, hurrying away on her old legs, went through the back yard to the servants\u2019 quarters.\n\nWhile M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna was running to her room the officer walked about the yard gazing at his worn-out boots with lowered head and a faint smile on his lips. \u201cWhat a pity I\u2019ve missed Uncle! What a nice old woman! Where has she run off to? And how am I to find the nearest way to overtake my regiment, which must by now be getting near the Rog\u00f3zhski gate?\u201d thought he. Just then M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna appeared from behind the corner of the house with a frightened yet resolute look, carrying a rolled-up check kerchief in her hand. While still a few steps from the officer she unfolded the kerchief and took out of it a white twenty-five-ruble assignat and hastily handed it to him.\n\n\u201cIf his excellency had been at home, as a kinsman he would of course... but as it is...\u201d\n\nM\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna grew abashed and confused. The officer did not decline, but took the note quietly and thanked her.\n\n\u201cIf the count had been at home...\u201d M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna went on apologetically. \u201cChrist be with you, sir! May God preserve you!\u201d said she, bowing as she saw him out.\n\nSwaying his head and smiling as if amused at himself, the officer ran almost at a trot through the deserted streets toward the Ya\u00faza bridge to overtake his regiment.\n\nBut M\u00e1vra Kuzm\u00ednichna stood at the closed gate for some time with moist eyes, pensively swaying her head and feeling an unexpected flow of motherly tenderness and pity for the unknown young officer.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIII\n\nFrom an unfinished house on the Varv\u00e1rka, the ground floor of which was a dramshop, came drunken shouts and songs. On benches round the tables in a dirty little room sat some ten factory hands. Tipsy and perspiring, with dim eyes and wide-open mouths, they were all laboriously singing some song or other. They were singing discordantly, arduously, and with great effort, evidently not because they wished to sing, but because they wanted to show they were drunk and on a spree. One, a tall, fair-haired lad in a clean blue coat, was standing over the others. His face with its fine straight nose would have been handsome had it not been for his thin, compressed, twitching lips and dull, gloomy, fixed eyes. Evidently possessed by some idea, he stood over those who were singing, and solemnly and jerkily flourished above their heads his white arm with the sleeve turned up to the elbow, trying unnaturally to spread out his dirty fingers. The sleeve of his coat kept slipping down and he always carefully rolled it up again with his left hand, as if it were most important that the sinewy white arm he was flourishing should be bare. In the midst of the song cries were heard, and fighting and blows in the passage and porch. The tall lad waved his arm.\n\n\u201cStop it!\u201d he exclaimed peremptorily. \u201cThere\u2019s a fight, lads!\u201d And, still rolling up his sleeve, he went out to the porch.\n\nThe factory hands followed him. These men, who under the leadership of the tall lad were drinking in the dramshop that morning, had brought the publican some skins from the factory and for this had had drink served them. The blacksmiths from a neighboring smithy, hearing the sounds of revelry in the tavern and supposing it to have been broken into, wished to force their way in too and a fight in the porch had resulted.\n\nThe publican was fighting one of the smiths at the door, and when the workmen came out the smith, wrenching himself free from the tavern keeper, fell face downward on the pavement.\n\nAnother smith tried to enter the doorway, pressing against the publican with his chest.\n\nThe lad with the turned-up sleeve gave the smith a blow in the face and cried wildly: \u201cThey\u2019re fighting us, lads!\u201d\n\nAt that moment the first smith got up and, scratching his bruised face to make it bleed, shouted in a tearful voice: \u201cPolice! Murder!... They\u2019ve killed a man, lads!\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, gracious me, a man beaten to death\u2014killed!...\u201d screamed a woman coming out of a gate close by.\n\nA crowd gathered round the bloodstained smith.\n\n\u201cHaven\u2019t you robbed people enough\u2014taking their last shirts?\u201d said a voice addressing the publican. \u201cWhat have you killed a man for, you thief?\u201d\n\nThe tall lad, standing in the porch, turned his bleared eyes from the publican to the smith and back again as if considering whom he ought to fight now.\n\n\u201cMurderer!\u201d he shouted suddenly to the publican. \u201cBind him, lads!\u201d\n\n\u201cI daresay you would like to bind me!\u201d shouted the publican, pushing away the men advancing on him, and snatching his cap from his head he flung it on the ground.\n\nAs if this action had some mysterious and menacing significance, the workmen surrounding the publican paused in indecision.\n\n\u201cI know the law very well, mates! I\u2019ll take the matter to the captain of police. You think I won\u2019t get to him? Robbery is not permitted to anybody nowadays!\u201d shouted the publican, picking up his cap.\n\n\u201cCome along then! Come along then!\u201d the publican and the tall young fellow repeated one after the other, and they moved up the street together.\n\nThe bloodstained smith went beside them. The factory hands and others followed behind, talking and shouting.\n\nAt the corner of the Moros\u00e9yka, opposite a large house with closed shutters and bearing a bootmaker\u2019s signboard, stood a score of thin, worn-out, gloomy-faced bootmakers, wearing overalls and long tattered coats.\n\n\u201cHe should pay folks off properly,\u201d a thin workingman, with frowning brows and a straggly beard, was saying.\n\n\u201cBut he\u2019s sucked our blood and now he thinks he\u2019s quit of us. He\u2019s been misleading us all the week and now that he\u2019s brought us to this pass he\u2019s made off.\u201d\n\nOn seeing the crowd and the bloodstained man the workman ceased speaking, and with eager curiosity all the bootmakers joined the moving crowd.\n\n\u201cWhere are all the folks going?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, to the police, of course!\u201d\n\n\u201cI say, is it true that we have been beaten?\u201d \u201cAnd what did you think? Look what folks are saying.\u201d\n\nQuestions and answers were heard. The publican, taking advantage of the increased crowd, dropped behind and returned to his tavern.\n\nThe tall youth, not noticing the disappearance of his foe, waved his bare arm and went on talking incessantly, attracting general attention to himself. It was around him that the people chiefly crowded, expecting answers from him to the questions that occupied all their minds.\n\n\u201cHe must keep order, keep the law, that\u2019s what the government is there for. Am I not right, good Christians?\u201d said the tall youth, with a scarcely perceptible smile. \u201cHe thinks there\u2019s no government! How can one do without government? Or else there would be plenty who\u2019d rob us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy talk nonsense?\u201d rejoined voices in the crowd. \u201cWill they give up Moscow like this? They told you that for fun, and you believed it! Aren\u2019t there plenty of troops on the march? Let him in, indeed! That\u2019s what the government is for. You\u2019d better listen to what people are saying,\u201d said some of the mob pointing to the tall youth.\n\nBy the wall of China-Town a smaller group of people were gathered round a man in a frieze coat who held a paper in his hand.\n\n\u201cAn uk\u00e1se, they are reading an uk\u00e1se! Reading an uk\u00e1se!\u201d cried voices in the crowd, and the people rushed toward the reader.\n\nThe man in the frieze coat was reading the broadsheet of August 31. When the crowd collected round him he seemed confused, but at the demand of the tall lad who had pushed his way up to him, he began in a rather tremulous voice to read the sheet from the beginning.\n\n\u201cEarly tomorrow I shall go to his Serene Highness,\u201d he read (\u201cSirin Highness,\u201d said the tall fellow with a triumphant smile on his lips and a frown on his brow), \u201cto consult with him to act, and to aid the army to exterminate these scoundrels. We too will take part...\u201d the reader went on, and then paused (\u201cDo you see,\u201d shouted the youth victoriously, \u201che\u2019s going to clear up the whole affair for you....\u201d), \u201cin destroying them, and will send these visitors to the devil. I will come back to dinner, and we\u2019ll set to work. We will do, completely do, and undo these scoundrels.\u201d\n\nThe last words were read out in the midst of complete silence. The tall lad hung his head gloomily. It was evident that no one had understood the last part. In particular, the words \u201cI will come back to dinner,\u201d evidently displeased both reader and audience. The people\u2019s minds were tuned to a high pitch and this was too simple and needlessly comprehensible\u2014it was what any one of them might have said and therefore was what an uk\u00e1se emanating from the highest authority should not say.\n\nThey all stood despondent and silent. The tall youth moved his lips and swayed from side to side.\n\n\u201cWe should ask him... that\u2019s he himself?\u201d... \u201cYes, ask him indeed!... Why not? He\u2019ll explain\u201d... voices in the rear of the crowd were suddenly heard saying, and the general attention turned to the police superintendent\u2019s trap which drove into the square attended by two mounted dragoons.\n\nThe superintendent of police, who had gone that morning by Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s orders to burn the barges and had in connection with that matter acquired a large sum of money which was at that moment in his pocket, on seeing a crowd bearing down upon him told his coachman to stop.\n\n\u201cWhat people are these?\u201d he shouted to the men, who were moving singly and timidly in the direction of his trap.\n\n\u201cWhat people are these?\u201d he shouted again, receiving no answer.\n\n\u201cYour honor...\u201d replied the shopman in the frieze coat, \u201cyour honor, in accord with the proclamation of his highest excellency the count, they desire to serve, not sparing their lives, and it is not any kind of riot, but as his highest excellence said...\u201d\n\n\u201cThe count has not left, he is here, and an order will be issued concerning you,\u201d said the superintendent of police. \u201cGo on!\u201d he ordered his coachman.\n\nThe crowd halted, pressing around those who had heard what the superintendent had said, and looking at the departing trap.\n\nThe superintendent of police turned round at that moment with a scared look, said something to his coachman, and his horses increased their speed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a fraud, lads! Lead the way to him, himself!\u201d shouted the tall youth. \u201cDon\u2019t let him go, lads! Let him answer us! Keep him!\u201d shouted different people and the people dashed in pursuit of the trap.\n\nFollowing the superintendent of police and talking loudly the crowd went in the direction of the Luby\u00e1nka Street.\n\n\u201cThere now, the gentry and merchants have gone away and left us to perish. Do they think we\u2019re dogs?\u201d voices in the crowd were heard saying more and more frequently.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIV\n\nOn the evening of the first of September, after his interview with Kut\u00fazov, Count Rostopch\u00edn had returned to Moscow mortified and offended because he had not been invited to attend the council of war, and because Kut\u00fazov had paid no attention to his offer to take part in the defense of the city; amazed also at the novel outlook revealed to him at the camp, which treated the tranquillity of the capital and its patriotic fervor as not merely secondary but quite irrelevant and unimportant matters. Distressed, offended, and surprised by all this, Rostopch\u00edn had returned to Moscow. After supper he lay down on a sofa without undressing, and was awakened soon after midnight by a courier bringing him a letter from Kut\u00fazov. This letter requested the count to send police officers to guide the troops through the town, as the army was retreating to the Ryaz\u00e1n road beyond Moscow. This was not news to Rostopch\u00edn. He had known that Moscow would be abandoned not merely since his interview the previous day with Kut\u00fazov on the Pokl\u00f3nny Hill but ever since the battle of Borodin\u00f3, for all the generals who came to Moscow after that battle had said unanimously that it was impossible to fight another battle, and since then the government property had been removed every night, and half the inhabitants had left the city with Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s own permission. Yet all the same this information astonished and irritated the count, coming as it did in the form of a simple note with an order from Kut\u00fazov, and received at night, breaking in on his beauty sleep.\n\nWhen later on in his memoirs Count Rostopch\u00edn explained his actions at this time, he repeatedly says that he was then actuated by two important considerations: to maintain tranquillity in Moscow and expedite the departure of the inhabitants. If one accepts this twofold aim all Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s actions appear irreproachable. \u201cWhy were the holy relics, the arms, ammunition, gunpowder, and stores of corn not removed? Why were thousands of inhabitants deceived into believing that Moscow would not be given up\u2014and thereby ruined?\u201d \u201cTo preserve the tranquillity of the city,\u201d explains Count Rostopch\u00edn. \u201cWhy were bundles of useless papers from the government offices, and Leppich\u2019s balloon and other articles removed?\u201d \u201cTo leave the town empty,\u201d explains Count Rostopch\u00edn. One need only admit that public tranquillity is in danger and any action finds a justification.\n\nAll the horrors of the reign of terror were based only on solicitude for public tranquillity.\n\nOn what, then, was Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s fear for the tranquillity of Moscow based in 1812? What reason was there for assuming any probability of an uprising in the city? The inhabitants were leaving it and the retreating troops were filling it. Why should that cause the masses to riot?\n\nNeither in Moscow nor anywhere in Russia did anything resembling an insurrection ever occur when the enemy entered a town. More than ten thousand people were still in Moscow on the first and second of September, and except for a mob in the governor\u2019s courtyard, assembled there at his bidding, nothing happened. It is obvious that there would have been even less reason to expect a disturbance among the people if after the battle of Borodin\u00f3, when the surrender of Moscow became certain or at least probable, Rostopch\u00edn instead of exciting the people by distributing arms and broadsheets had taken steps to remove all the holy relics, the gunpowder, munitions, and money, and had told the population plainly that the town would be abandoned.\n\nRostopch\u00edn, though he had patriotic sentiments, was a sanguine and impulsive man who had always moved in the highest administrative circles and had no understanding at all of the people he supposed himself to be guiding. Ever since the enemy\u2019s entry into Smol\u00e9nsk he had in imagination been playing the role of director of the popular feeling of \u201cthe heart of Russia.\u201d Not only did it seem to him (as to all administrators) that he controlled the external actions of Moscow\u2019s inhabitants, but he also thought he controlled their mental attitude by means of his broadsheets and posters, written in a coarse tone which the people despise in their own class and do not understand from those in authority. Rostopch\u00edn was so pleased with the fine role of leader of popular feeling, and had grown so used to it, that the necessity of relinquishing that role and abandoning Moscow without any heroic display took him unawares and he suddenly felt the ground slip away from under his feet, so that he positively did not know what to do. Though he knew it was coming, he did not till the last moment wholeheartedly believe that Moscow would be abandoned, and did not prepare for it. The inhabitants left against his wishes. If the government offices were removed, this was only done on the demand of officials to whom the count yielded reluctantly. He was absorbed in the role he had created for himself. As is often the case with those gifted with an ardent imagination, though he had long known that Moscow would be abandoned he knew it only with his intellect, he did not believe it in his heart and did not adapt himself mentally to this new position of affairs.\n\nAll his painstaking and energetic activity (in how far it was useful and had any effect on the people is another question) had been simply directed toward arousing in the masses his own feeling of patriotic hatred of the French.\n\nBut when events assumed their true historical character, when expressing hatred for the French in words proved insufficient, when it was not even possible to express that hatred by fighting a battle, when self-confidence was of no avail in relation to the one question before Moscow, when the whole population streamed out of Moscow as one man, abandoning their belongings and proving by that negative action all the depth of their national feeling, then the role chosen by Rostopch\u00edn suddenly appeared senseless. He unexpectedly felt himself ridiculous, weak, and alone, with no ground to stand on.\n\nWhen, awakened from his sleep, he received that cold, peremptory note from Kut\u00fazov, he felt the more irritated the more he felt himself to blame. All that he had been specially put in charge of, the state property which he should have removed, was still in Moscow and it was no longer possible to take the whole of it away.\n\n\u201cWho is to blame for it? Who has let things come to such a pass?\u201d he ruminated. \u201cNot I, of course. I had everything ready. I had Moscow firmly in hand. And this is what they have let it come to! Villains! Traitors!\u201d he thought, without clearly defining who the villains and traitors were, but feeling it necessary to hate those traitors whoever they might be who were to blame for the false and ridiculous position in which he found himself.\n\nAll that night Count Rostopch\u00edn issued orders, for which people came to him from all parts of Moscow. Those about him had never seen the count so morose and irritable.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, the Director of the Registrar\u2019s Department has sent for instructions.... From the Consistory, from the Senate, from the University, from the Foundling Hospital, the Suffragan has sent... asking for information.... What are your orders about the Fire Brigade? From the governor of the prison... from the superintendent of the lunatic asylum...\u201d All night long such announcements were continually being received by the count.\n\nTo all these inquiries he gave brief and angry replies indicating that orders from him were not now needed, that the whole affair, carefully prepared by him, had now been ruined by somebody, and that that somebody would have to bear the whole responsibility for all that might happen.\n\n\u201cOh, tell that blockhead,\u201d he said in reply to the question from the Registrar\u2019s Department, \u201cthat he should remain to guard his documents. Now why are you asking silly questions about the Fire Brigade? They have horses, let them be off to Vlad\u00edmir, and not leave them to the French.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour excellency, the superintendent of the lunatic asylum has come: what are your commands?\u201d\n\n\u201cMy commands? Let them go away, that\u2019s all.... And let the lunatics out into the town. When lunatics command our armies God evidently means these other madmen to be free.\u201d\n\nIn reply to an inquiry about the convicts in the prison, Count Rostopch\u00edn shouted angrily at the governor:\n\n\u201cDo you expect me to give you two battalions\u2014which we have not got\u2014for a convoy? Release them, that\u2019s all about it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYour excellency, there are some political prisoners, Meshk\u00f3v, Vereshch\u00e1gin...\u201d\n\n\u201cVereshch\u00e1gin! Hasn\u2019t he been hanged yet?\u201d shouted Rostopch\u00edn. \u201cBring him to me!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXV\n\nToward nine o\u2019clock in the morning, when the troops were already moving through Moscow, nobody came to the count any more for instructions. Those who were able to get away were going of their own accord, those who remained behind decided for themselves what they must do.\n\nThe count ordered his carriage that he might drive to Sok\u00f3lniki, and sat in his study with folded hands, morose, sallow, and taciturn.\n\nIn quiet and untroubled times it seems to every administrator that it is only by his efforts that the whole population under his rule is kept going, and in this consciousness of being indispensable every administrator finds the chief reward of his labor and efforts. While the sea of history remains calm the ruler-administrator in his frail bark, holding on with a boat hook to the ship of the people and himself moving, naturally imagines that his efforts move the ship he is holding on to. But as soon as a storm arises and the sea begins to heave and the ship to move, such a delusion is no longer possible. The ship moves independently with its own enormous motion, the boat hook no longer reaches the moving vessel, and suddenly the administrator, instead of appearing a ruler and a source of power, becomes an insignificant, useless, feeble man.\n\nRostopch\u00edn felt this, and it was this which exasperated him.\n\nThe superintendent of police, whom the crowd had stopped, went in to see him at the same time as an adjutant who informed the count that the horses were harnessed. They were both pale, and the superintendent of police, after reporting that he had executed the instructions he had received, informed the count that an immense crowd had collected in the courtyard and wished to see him.\n\nWithout saying a word Rostopch\u00edn rose and walked hastily to his light, luxurious drawing room, went to the balcony door, took hold of the handle, let it go again, and went to the window from which he had a better view of the whole crowd. The tall lad was standing in front, flourishing his arm and saying something with a stern look. The blood-stained smith stood beside him with a gloomy face. A drone of voices was audible through the closed window.\n\n\u201cIs my carriage ready?\u201d asked Rostopch\u00edn, stepping back from the window.\n\n\u201cIt is, your excellency,\u201d replied the adjutant.\n\nRostopch\u00edn went again to the balcony door.\n\n\u201cBut what do they want?\u201d he asked the superintendent of police.\n\n\u201cYour excellency, they say they have got ready, according to your orders, to go against the French, and they shouted something about treachery. But it is a turbulent crowd, your excellency\u2014I hardly managed to get away from it. Your excellency, I venture to suggest...\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may go. I don\u2019t need you to tell me what to do!\u201d exclaimed Rostopch\u00edn angrily.\n\nHe stood by the balcony door looking at the crowd.\n\n\u201cThis is what they have done with Russia! This is what they have done with me!\u201d thought he, full of an irrepressible fury that welled up within him against the someone to whom what was happening might be attributed. As often happens with passionate people, he was mastered by anger but was still seeking an object on which to vent it. \u201cHere is that mob, the dregs of the people,\u201d he thought as he gazed at the crowd: \u201cthis rabble they have roused by their folly! They want a victim,\u201d he thought as he looked at the tall lad flourishing his arm. And this thought occurred to him just because he himself desired a victim, something on which to vent his rage.\n\n\u201cIs the carriage ready?\u201d he asked again.\n\n\u201cYes, your excellency. What are your orders about Vereshch\u00e1gin? He is waiting at the porch,\u201d said the adjutant.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d exclaimed Rostopch\u00edn, as if struck by an unexpected recollection.\n\nAnd rapidly opening the door he went resolutely out onto the balcony. The talking instantly ceased, hats and caps were doffed, and all eyes were raised to the count.\n\n\u201cGood morning, lads!\u201d said the count briskly and loudly. \u201cThank you for coming. I\u2019ll come out to you in a moment, but we must first settle with the villain. We must punish the villain who has caused the ruin of Moscow. Wait for me!\u201d\n\nAnd the count stepped as briskly back into the room and slammed the door behind him.\n\nA murmur of approbation and satisfaction ran through the crowd. \u201cHe\u2019ll settle with all the villains, you\u2019ll see! And you said the French... He\u2019ll show you what law is!\u201d the mob were saying as if reproving one another for their lack of confidence.\n\nA few minutes later an officer came hurriedly out of the front door, gave an order, and the dragoons formed up in line. The crowd moved eagerly from the balcony toward the porch. Rostopch\u00edn, coming out there with quick angry steps, looked hastily around as if seeking someone.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d he inquired. And as he spoke he saw a young man coming round the corner of the house between two dragoons. He had a long thin neck, and his head, that had been half shaved, was again covered by short hair. This young man was dressed in a threadbare blue cloth coat lined with fox fur, that had once been smart, and dirty hempen convict trousers, over which were pulled his thin, dirty, trodden-down boots. On his thin, weak legs were heavy chains which hampered his irresolute movements.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said Rostopch\u00edn, hurriedly turning away his eyes from the young man in the fur-lined coat and pointing to the bottom step of the porch. \u201cPut him there.\u201d\n\nThe young man in his clattering chains stepped clumsily to the spot indicated, holding away with one finger the coat collar which chafed his neck, turned his long neck twice this way and that, sighed, and submissively folded before him his thin hands, unused to work.\n\nFor several seconds while the young man was taking his place on the step the silence continued. Only among the back rows of the people, who were all pressing toward the one spot, could sighs, groans, and the shuffling of feet be heard.\n\nWhile waiting for the young man to take his place on the step Rostopch\u00edn stood frowning and rubbing his face with his hand.\n\n\u201cLads!\u201d said he, with a metallic ring in his voice. \u201cThis man, Vereshch\u00e1gin, is the scoundrel by whose doing Moscow is perishing.\u201d\n\nThe young man in the fur-lined coat, stooping a little, stood in a submissive attitude, his fingers clasped before him. His emaciated young face, disfigured by the half-shaven head, hung down hopelessly. At the count\u2019s first words he raised it slowly and looked up at him as if wishing to say something or at least to meet his eye. But Rostopch\u00edn did not look at him. A vein in the young man\u2019s long thin neck swelled like a cord and went blue behind the ear, and suddenly his face flushed.\n\nAll eyes were fixed on him. He looked at the crowd, and rendered more hopeful by the expression he read on the faces there, he smiled sadly and timidly, and lowering his head shifted his feet on the step.\n\n\u201cHe has betrayed his Tsar and his country, he has gone over to Bonaparte. He alone of all the Russians has disgraced the Russian name, he has caused Moscow to perish,\u201d said Rostopch\u00edn in a sharp, even voice, but suddenly he glanced down at Vereshch\u00e1gin who continued to stand in the same submissive attitude. As if inflamed by the sight, he raised his arm and addressed the people, almost shouting:\n\n\u201cDeal with him as you think fit! I hand him over to you.\u201d\n\nThe crowd remained silent and only pressed closer and closer to one another. To keep one another back, to breathe in that stifling atmosphere, to be unable to stir, and to await something unknown, uncomprehended, and terrible, was becoming unbearable. Those standing in front, who had seen and heard what had taken place before them, all stood with wide-open eyes and mouths, straining with all their strength, and held back the crowd that was pushing behind them.\n\n\u201cBeat him!... Let the traitor perish and not disgrace the Russian name!\u201d shouted Rostopch\u00edn. \u201cCut him down. I command it.\u201d\n\nHearing not so much the words as the angry tone of Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s voice, the crowd moaned and heaved forward, but again paused.\n\n\u201cCount!\u201d exclaimed the timid yet theatrical voice of Vereshch\u00e1gin in the midst of the momentary silence that ensued, \u201cCount! One God is above us both....\u201d He lifted his head and again the thick vein in his thin neck filled with blood and the color rapidly came and went in his face.\n\nHe did not finish what he wished to say.\n\n\u201cCut him down! I command it...\u201d shouted Rostopch\u00edn, suddenly growing pale like Vereshch\u00e1gin.\n\n\u201cDraw sabers!\u201d cried the dragoon officer, drawing his own.\n\nAnother still stronger wave flowed through the crowd and reaching the front ranks carried it swaying to the very steps of the porch. The tall youth, with a stony look on his face, and rigid and uplifted arm, stood beside Vereshch\u00e1gin.\n\n\u201cSaber him!\u201d the dragoon officer almost whispered.\n\nAnd one of the soldiers, his face all at once distorted with fury, struck Vereshch\u00e1gin on the head with the blunt side of his saber.\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d cried Vereshch\u00e1gin in meek surprise, looking round with a frightened glance as if not understanding why this was done to him. A similar moan of surprise and horror ran through the crowd. \u201cO Lord!\u201d exclaimed a sorrowful voice.\n\nBut after the exclamation of surprise that had escaped from Vereshch\u00e1gin he uttered a plaintive cry of pain, and that cry was fatal. The barrier of human feeling, strained to the utmost, that had held the crowd in check suddenly broke. The crime had begun and must now be completed. The plaintive moan of reproach was drowned by the threatening and angry roar of the crowd. Like the seventh and last wave that shatters a ship, that last irresistible wave burst from the rear and reached the front ranks, carrying them off their feet and engulfing them all. The dragoon was about to repeat his blow. Vereshch\u00e1gin with a cry of horror, covering his head with his hands, rushed toward the crowd. The tall youth, against whom he stumbled, seized his thin neck with his hands and, yelling wildly, fell with him under the feet of the pressing, struggling crowd.\n\nSome beat and tore at Vereshch\u00e1gin, others at the tall youth. And the screams of those that were being trampled on and of those who tried to rescue the tall lad only increased the fury of the crowd. It was a long time before the dragoons could extricate the bleeding youth, beaten almost to death. And for a long time, despite the feverish haste with which the mob tried to end the work that had been begun, those who were hitting, throttling, and tearing at Vereshch\u00e1gin were unable to kill him, for the crowd pressed from all sides, swaying as one mass with them in the center and rendering it impossible for them either to kill him or let him go.\n\n\u201cHit him with an ax, eh!... Crushed?... Traitor, he sold Christ.... Still alive... tenacious... serves him right! Torture serves a thief right. Use the hatchet!... What\u2014still alive?\u201d\n\nOnly when the victim ceased to struggle and his cries changed to a long-drawn, measured death rattle did the crowd around his prostrate, bleeding corpse begin rapidly to change places. Each one came up, glanced at what had been done, and with horror, reproach, and astonishment pushed back again.\n\n\u201cO Lord! The people are like wild beasts! How could he be alive?\u201d voices in the crowd could be heard saying. \u201cQuite a young fellow too... must have been a merchant\u2019s son. What men!... and they say he\u2019s not the right one.... How not the right one?... O Lord! And there\u2019s another has been beaten too\u2014they say he\u2019s nearly done for.... Oh, the people... Aren\u2019t they afraid of sinning?...\u201d said the same mob now, looking with pained distress at the dead body with its long, thin, half-severed neck and its livid face stained with blood and dust.\n\nA painstaking police officer, considering the presence of a corpse in his excellency\u2019s courtyard unseemly, told the dragoons to take it away. Two dragoons took it by its distorted legs and dragged it along the ground. The gory, dust-stained, half-shaven head with its long neck trailed twisting along the ground. The crowd shrank back from it.\n\nAt the moment when Vereshch\u00e1gin fell and the crowd closed in with savage yells and swayed about him, Rostopch\u00edn suddenly turned pale and, instead of going to the back entrance where his carriage awaited him, went with hurried steps and bent head, not knowing where and why, along the passage leading to the rooms on the ground floor. The count\u2019s face was white and he could not control the feverish twitching of his lower jaw.\n\n\u201cThis way, your excellency... Where are you going?... This way, please...\u201d said a trembling, frightened voice behind him.\n\nCount Rostopch\u00edn was unable to reply and, turning obediently, went in the direction indicated. At the back entrance stood his cal\u00e8che. The distant roar of the yelling crowd was audible even there. He hastily took his seat and told the coachman to drive him to his country house in Sok\u00f3lniki.\n\nWhen they reached the Myasn\u00edtski Street and could no longer hear the shouts of the mob, the count began to repent. He remembered with dissatisfaction the agitation and fear he had betrayed before his subordinates. \u201cThe mob is terrible\u2014disgusting,\u201d he said to himself in French. \u201cThey are like wolves whom nothing but flesh can appease.\u201d \u201cCount! One God is above us both!\u201d\u2014Vereshch\u00e1gin\u2019s words suddenly recurred to him, and a disagreeable shiver ran down his back. But this was only a momentary feeling and Count Rostopch\u00edn smiled disdainfully at himself. \u201cI had other duties,\u201d thought he. \u201cThe people had to be appeased. Many other victims have perished and are perishing for the public good\u201d\u2014and he began thinking of his social duties to his family and to the city entrusted to him, and of himself\u2014not himself as Theodore Vas\u00edlyevich Rostopch\u00edn (he fancied that Theodore Vas\u00edlyevich Rostopch\u00edn was sacrificing himself for the public good) but himself as governor, the representative of authority and of the Tsar. \u201cHad I been simply Theodore Vas\u00edlyevich my course of action would have been quite different, but it was my duty to safeguard my life and dignity as commander in chief.\u201d\n\nLightly swaying on the flexible springs of his carriage and no longer hearing the terrible sounds of the crowd, Rostopch\u00edn grew physically calm and, as always happens, as soon as he became physically tranquil his mind devised reasons why he should be mentally tranquil too. The thought which tranquillized Rostopch\u00edn was not a new one. Since the world began and men have killed one another no one has ever committed such a crime against his fellow man without comforting himself with this same idea. This idea is le bien public, the hypothetical welfare of other people.\n\nTo a man not swayed by passion that welfare is never certain, but he who commits such a crime always knows just where that welfare lies. And Rostopch\u00edn now knew it.\n\nNot only did his reason not reproach him for what he had done, but he even found cause for self-satisfaction in having so successfully contrived to avail himself of a convenient opportunity to punish a criminal and at the same time pacify the mob.\n\n\u201cVereshch\u00e1gin was tried and condemned to death,\u201d thought Rostopch\u00edn (though the Senate had only condemned Vereshch\u00e1gin to hard labor), \u201che was a traitor and a spy. I could not let him go unpunished and so I have killed two birds with one stone: to appease the mob I gave them a victim and at the same time punished a miscreant.\u201d\n\nHaving reached his country house and begun to give orders about domestic arrangements, the count grew quite tranquil.\n\nHalf an hour later he was driving with his fast horses across the Sok\u00f3lniki field, no longer thinking of what had occurred but considering what was to come. He was driving to the Ya\u00faza bridge where he had heard that Kut\u00fazov was. Count Rostopch\u00edn was mentally preparing the angry and stinging reproaches he meant to address to Kut\u00fazov for his deception. He would make that foxy old courtier feel that the responsibility for all the calamities that would follow the abandonment of the city and the ruin of Russia (as Rostopch\u00edn regarded it) would fall upon his doting old head. Planning beforehand what he would say to Kut\u00fazov, Rostopch\u00edn turned angrily in his cal\u00e8che and gazed sternly from side to side.\n\nThe Sok\u00f3lniki field was deserted. Only at the end of it, in front of the almshouse and the lunatic asylum, could be seen some people in white and others like them walking singly across the field shouting and gesticulating.\n\nOne of these was running to cross the path of Count Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s carriage, and the count himself, his coachman, and his dragoons looked with vague horror and curiosity at these released lunatics and especially at the one running toward them.\n\nSwaying from side to side on his long, thin legs in his fluttering dressing gown, this lunatic was running impetuously, his gaze fixed on Rostopch\u00edn, shouting something in a hoarse voice and making signs to him to stop. The lunatic\u2019s solemn, gloomy face was thin and yellow, with its beard growing in uneven tufts. His black, agate pupils with saffron-yellow whites moved restlessly near the lower eyelids.\n\n\u201cStop! Pull up, I tell you!\u201d he cried in a piercing voice, and again shouted something breathlessly with emphatic intonations and gestures.\n\nComing abreast of the cal\u00e8che he ran beside it.\n\n\u201cThrice have they slain me, thrice have I risen from the dead. They stoned me, crucified me... I shall rise... shall rise... shall rise. They have torn my body. The kingdom of God will be overthrown... Thrice will I overthrow it and thrice re-establish it!\u201d he cried, raising his voice higher and higher.\n\nCount Rostopch\u00edn suddenly grew pale as he had done when the crowd closed in on Vereshch\u00e1gin. He turned away. \u201cGo fas... faster!\u201d he cried in a trembling voice to his coachman. The cal\u00e8che flew over the ground as fast as the horses could draw it, but for a long time Count Rostopch\u00edn still heard the insane despairing screams growing fainter in the distance, while his eyes saw nothing but the astonished, frightened, bloodstained face of \u201cthe traitor\u201d in the fur-lined coat.\n\nRecent as that mental picture was, Rostopch\u00edn already felt that it had cut deep into his heart and drawn blood. Even now he felt clearly that the gory trace of that recollection would not pass with time, but that the terrible memory would, on the contrary, dwell in his heart ever more cruelly and painfully to the end of his life. He seemed still to hear the sound of his own words: \u201cCut him down! I command it....\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy did I utter those words? It was by some accident I said them.... I need not have said them,\u201d he thought. \u201cAnd then nothing would have happened.\u201d He saw the frightened and then infuriated face of the dragoon who dealt the blow, the look of silent, timid reproach that boy in the fur-lined coat had turned upon him. \u201cBut I did not do it for my own sake. I was bound to act that way.... The mob, the traitor... the public welfare,\u201d thought he.\n\nTroops were still crowding at the Ya\u00faza bridge. It was hot. Kut\u00fazov, dejected and frowning, sat on a bench by the bridge toying with his whip in the sand when a cal\u00e8che dashed up noisily. A man in a general\u2019s uniform with plumes in his hat went up to Kut\u00fazov and said something in French. It was Count Rostopch\u00edn. He told Kut\u00fazov that he had come because Moscow, the capital, was no more and only the army remained.\n\n\u201cThings would have been different if your Serene Highness had not told me that you would not abandon Moscow without another battle; all this would not have happened,\u201d he said.\n\nKut\u00fazov looked at Rostopch\u00edn as if, not grasping what was said to him, he was trying to read something peculiar written at that moment on the face of the man addressing him. Rostopch\u00edn grew confused and became silent. Kut\u00fazov slightly shook his head and not taking his penetrating gaze from Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s face muttered softly:\n\n\u201cNo! I shall not give up Moscow without a battle!\u201d\n\nWhether Kut\u00fazov was thinking of something entirely different when he spoke those words, or uttered them purposely, knowing them to be meaningless, at any rate Rostopch\u00edn made no reply and hastily left him. And strange to say, the Governor of Moscow, the proud Count Rostopch\u00edn, took up a Cossack whip and went to the bridge where he began with shouts to drive on the carts that blocked the way.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVI\n\nToward four o\u2019clock in the afternoon Murat\u2019s troops were entering Moscow. In front rode a detachment of W\u00fcrttemberg hussars and behind them rode the King of Naples himself accompanied by a numerous suite.\n\nAbout the middle of the Arb\u00e1t Street, near the Church of the Miraculous Icon of St. Nicholas, Murat halted to await news from the advanced detachment as to the condition in which they had found the citadel, le Kremlin.\n\nAround Murat gathered a group of those who had remained in Moscow. They all stared in timid bewilderment at the strange, long-haired commander dressed up in feathers and gold.\n\n\u201cIs that their Tsar himself? He\u2019s not bad!\u201d low voices could be heard saying.\n\nAn interpreter rode up to the group.\n\n\u201cTake off your cap... your caps!\u201d These words went from one to another in the crowd. The interpreter addressed an old porter and asked if it was far to the Kr\u00e9mlin. The porter, listening in perplexity to the unfamiliar Polish accent and not realizing that the interpreter was speaking Russian, did not understand what was being said to him and slipped behind the others.\n\nMurat approached the interpreter and told him to ask where the Russian army was. One of the Russians understood what was asked and several voices at once began answering the interpreter. A French officer, returning from the advanced detachment, rode up to Murat and reported that the gates of the citadel had been barricaded and that there was probably an ambuscade there.\n\n\u201cGood!\u201d said Murat and, turning to one of the gentlemen in his suite, ordered four light guns to be moved forward to fire at the gates.\n\nThe guns emerged at a trot from the column following Murat and advanced up the Arb\u00e1t. When they reached the end of the Vozdv\u00edzhenka Street they halted and drew in the Square. Several French officers superintended the placing of the guns and looked at the Kr\u00e9mlin through field glasses.\n\nThe bells in the Kr\u00e9mlin were ringing for vespers, and this sound troubled the French. They imagined it to be a call to arms. A few infantrymen ran to the Kut\u00e1fyev Gate. Beams and wooden screens had been put there, and two musket shots rang out from under the gate as soon as an officer and men began to run toward it. A general who was standing by the guns shouted some words of command to the officer, and the latter ran back again with his men.\n\nThe sound of three more shots came from the gate.\n\nOne shot struck a French soldier\u2019s foot, and from behind the screens came the strange sound of a few voices shouting. Instantly as at a word of command the expression of cheerful serenity on the faces of the French general, officers, and men changed to one of determined concentrated readiness for strife and suffering. To all of them from the marshal to the least soldier, that place was not the Vozdv\u00edzhenka, Mokhav\u00e1ya, or Kut\u00e1fyev Street, nor the Tr\u00f3itsa Gate (places familiar in Moscow), but a new battlefield which would probably prove sanguinary. And all made ready for that battle. The cries from the gates ceased. The guns were advanced, the artillerymen blew the ash off their linstocks, and an officer gave the word \u201cFire!\u201d This was followed by two whistling sounds of canister shot, one after another. The shot rattled against the stone of the gate and upon the wooden beams and screens, and two wavering clouds of smoke rose over the Square.\n\nA few instants after the echo of the reports resounding over the stone-built Kr\u00e9mlin had died away the French heard a strange sound above their head. Thousands of crows rose above the walls and circled in the air, cawing and noisily flapping their wings. Together with that sound came a solitary human cry from the gateway and amid the smoke appeared the figure of a bareheaded man in a peasant\u2019s coat. He grasped a musket and took aim at the French. \u201cFire!\u201d repeated the officer once more, and the reports of a musket and of two cannon shots were heard simultaneously. The gate was again hidden by smoke.\n\nNothing more stirred behind the screens and the French infantry soldiers and officers advanced to the gate. In the gateway lay three wounded and four dead. Two men in peasant coats ran away at the foot of the wall, toward the Zn\u00e1menka.\n\n\u201cClear that away!\u201d said the officer, pointing to the beams and the corpses, and the French soldiers, after dispatching the wounded, threw the corpses over the parapet.\n\nWho these men were nobody knew. \u201cClear that away!\u201d was all that was said of them, and they were thrown over the parapet and removed later on that they might not stink. Thiers alone dedicates a few eloquent lines to their memory: \u201cThese wretches had occupied the sacred citadel, having supplied themselves with guns from the arsenal, and fired\u201d (the wretches) \u201cat the French. Some of them were sabered and the Kr\u00e9mlin was purged of their presence.\u201d\n\nMurat was informed that the way had been cleared. The French entered the gates and began pitching their camp in the Senate Square. Out of the windows of the Senate House the soldiers threw chairs into the Square for fuel and kindled fires there.\n\nOther detachments passed through the Kr\u00e9mlin and encamped along the Moros\u00e9yka, the Luby\u00e1nka, and Pokr\u00f3vka Streets. Others quartered themselves along the Vozdv\u00edzhenka, the Nik\u00f3lski, and the Tversk\u00f3y Streets. No masters of the houses being found anywhere, the French were not billeted on the inhabitants as is usual in towns but lived in it as in a camp.\n\nThough tattered, hungry, worn out, and reduced to a third of their original number, the French entered Moscow in good marching order. It was a weary and famished, but still a fighting and menacing army. But it remained an army only until its soldiers had dispersed into their different lodgings. As soon as the men of the various regiments began to disperse among the wealthy and deserted houses, the army was lost forever and there came into being something nondescript, neither citizens nor soldiers but what are known as marauders. When five weeks later these same men left Moscow, they no longer formed an army. They were a mob of marauders, each carrying a quantity of articles which seemed to him valuable or useful. The aim of each man when he left Moscow was no longer, as it had been, to conquer, but merely to keep what he had acquired. Like a monkey which puts its paw into the narrow neck of a jug, and having seized a handful of nuts will not open its fist for fear of losing what it holds, and therefore perishes, the French when they left Moscow had inevitably to perish because they carried their loot with them, yet to abandon what they had stolen was as impossible for them as it is for the monkey to open its paw and let go of its nuts. Ten minutes after each regiment had entered a Moscow district, not a soldier or officer was left. Men in military uniforms and Hessian boots could be seen through the windows, laughing and walking through the rooms. In cellars and storerooms similar men were busy among the provisions, and in the yards unlocking or breaking open coach house and stable doors, lighting fires in kitchens and kneading and baking bread with rolled-up sleeves, and cooking; or frightening, amusing, or caressing women and children. There were many such men both in the shops and houses\u2014but there was no army.\n\nOrder after order was issued by the French commanders that day forbidding the men to disperse about the town, sternly forbidding any violence to the inhabitants or any looting, and announcing a roll call for that very evening. But despite all these measures the men, who had till then constituted an army, flowed all over the wealthy, deserted city with its comforts and plentiful supplies. As a hungry herd of cattle keeps well together when crossing a barren field, but gets out of hand and at once disperses uncontrollably as soon as it reaches rich pastures, so did the army disperse all over the wealthy city.\n\nNo residents were left in Moscow, and the soldiers\u2014like water percolating through sand\u2014spread irresistibly through the city in all directions from the Kr\u00e9mlin into which they had first marched. The cavalry, on entering a merchant\u2019s house that had been abandoned and finding there stabling more than sufficient for their horses, went on, all the same, to the next house which seemed to them better. Many of them appropriated several houses, chalked their names on them, and quarreled and even fought with other companies for them. Before they had had time to secure quarters the soldiers ran out into the streets to see the city and, hearing that everything had been abandoned, rushed to places where valuables were to be had for the taking. The officers followed to check the soldiers and were involuntarily drawn into doing the same. In Carriage Row carriages had been left in the shops, and generals flocked there to select cal\u00e8ches and coaches for themselves. The few inhabitants who had remained invited commanding officers to their houses, hoping thereby to secure themselves from being plundered. There were masses of wealth and there seemed no end to it. All around the quarters occupied by the French were other regions still unexplored and unoccupied where, they thought, yet greater riches might be found. And Moscow engulfed the army ever deeper and deeper. When water is spilled on dry ground both the dry ground and the water disappear and mud results; and in the same way the entry of the famished army into the rich and deserted city resulted in fires and looting and the destruction of both the army and the wealthy city.\n\n\nThe French attributed the Fire of Moscow au patriotisme f\u00e9roce de Rostopch\u00edne, the Russians to the barbarity of the French. In reality, however, it was not, and could not be, possible to explain the burning of Moscow by making any individual, or any group of people, responsible for it. Moscow was burned because it found itself in a position in which any town built of wood was bound to burn, quite apart from whether it had, or had not, a hundred and thirty inferior fire engines. Deserted Moscow had to burn as inevitably as a heap of shavings has to burn on which sparks continually fall for several days. A town built of wood, where scarcely a day passes without conflagrations when the house owners are in residence and a police force is present, cannot help burning when its inhabitants have left it and it is occupied by soldiers who smoke pipes, make campfires of the Senate chairs in the Senate Square, and cook themselves meals twice a day. In peacetime it is only necessary to billet troops in the villages of any district and the number of fires in that district immediately increases. How much then must the probability of fire be increased in an abandoned, wooden town where foreign troops are quartered. \u201cLe patriotisme f\u00e9roce de Rostopch\u00edne\u201d and the barbarity of the French were not to blame in the matter. Moscow was set on fire by the soldiers\u2019 pipes, kitchens, and campfires, and by the carelessness of enemy soldiers occupying houses they did not own. Even if there was any arson (which is very doubtful, for no one had any reason to burn the houses\u2014in any case a troublesome and dangerous thing to do), arson cannot be regarded as the cause, for the same thing would have happened without any incendiarism.\n\nHowever tempting it might be for the French to blame Rostopch\u00edn\u2019s ferocity and for Russians to blame the scoundrel Bonaparte, or later on to place an heroic torch in the hands of their own people, it is impossible not to see that there could be no such direct cause of the fire, for Moscow had to burn as every village, factory, or house must burn which is left by its owners and in which strangers are allowed to live and cook their porridge. Moscow was burned by its inhabitants, it is true, but by those who had abandoned it and not by those who remained in it. Moscow when occupied by the enemy did not remain intact like Berlin, Vienna, and other towns, simply because its inhabitants abandoned it and did not welcome the French with bread and salt, nor bring them the keys of the city.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVII\n\nThe absorption of the French by Moscow, radiating starwise as it did, only reached the quarter where Pierre was staying by the evening of the second of September.\n\nAfter the last two days spent in solitude and unusual circumstances, Pierre was in a state bordering on insanity. He was completely obsessed by one persistent thought. He did not know how or when this thought had taken such possession of him, but he remembered nothing of the past, understood nothing of the present, and all he saw and heard appeared to him like a dream.\n\nHe had left home only to escape the intricate tangle of life\u2019s demands that enmeshed him, and which in his present condition he was unable to unravel. He had gone to Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s house, on the plea of sorting the deceased\u2019s books and papers, only in search of rest from life\u2019s turmoil, for in his mind the memory of Joseph Alex\u00e9evich was connected with a world of eternal, solemn, and calm thoughts, quite contrary to the restless confusion into which he felt himself being drawn. He sought a quiet refuge, and in Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s study he really found it. When he sat with his elbows on the dusty writing table in the deathlike stillness of the study, calm and significant memories of the last few days rose one after another in his imagination, particularly of the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and of that vague sense of his own insignificance and insincerity compared with the truth, simplicity, and strength of the class of men he mentally classed as they. When Ger\u00e1sim roused him from his reverie the idea occurred to him of taking part in the popular defense of Moscow which he knew was projected. And with that object he had asked Ger\u00e1sim to get him a peasant\u2019s coat and a pistol, confiding to him his intentions of remaining in Joseph Alex\u00e9evich\u2019s house and keeping his name secret. Then during the first day spent in inaction and solitude (he tried several times to fix his attention on the Masonic manuscripts, but was unable to do so) the idea that had previously occurred to him of the cabalistic significance of his name in connection with Bonaparte\u2019s more than once vaguely presented itself. But the idea that he, L\u2019russe Besuhof, was destined to set a limit to the power of the Beast was as yet only one of the fancies that often passed through his mind and left no trace behind.\n\nWhen, having bought the coat merely with the object of taking part among the people in the defense of Moscow, Pierre had met the Rost\u00f3vs and Nat\u00e1sha had said to him: \u201cAre you remaining in Moscow?... How splendid!\u201d the thought flashed into his mind that it really would be a good thing, even if Moscow were taken, for him to remain there and do what he was predestined to do.\n\nNext day, with the sole idea of not sparing himself and not lagging in any way behind them, Pierre went to the Three Hills gate. But when he returned to the house convinced that Moscow would not be defended, he suddenly felt that what before had seemed to him merely a possibility had now become absolutely necessary and inevitable. He must remain in Moscow, concealing his name, and must meet Napoleon and kill him, and either perish or put an end to the misery of all Europe\u2014which it seemed to him was solely due to Napoleon.\n\nPierre knew all the details of the attempt on Bonaparte\u2019s life in 1809 by a German student in Vienna, and knew that the student had been shot. And the risk to which he would expose his life by carrying out his design excited him still more.\n\nTwo equally strong feelings drew Pierre irresistibly to this purpose. The first was a feeling of the necessity of sacrifice and suffering in view of the common calamity, the same feeling that had caused him to go to Mozh\u00e1ysk on the twenty-fifth and to make his way to the very thick of the battle and had now caused him to run away from his home and, in place of the luxury and comfort to which he was accustomed, to sleep on a hard sofa without undressing and eat the same food as Ger\u00e1sim. The other was that vague and quite Russian feeling of contempt for everything conventional, artificial, and human\u2014for everything the majority of men regard as the greatest good in the world. Pierre had first experienced this strange and fascinating feeling at the Slob\u00f3da Palace, when he had suddenly felt that wealth, power, and life\u2014all that men so painstakingly acquire and guard\u2014if it has any worth has so only by reason of the joy with which it can all be renounced.\n\nIt was the feeling that induces a volunteer recruit to spend his last penny on drink, and a drunken man to smash mirrors or glasses for no apparent reason and knowing that it will cost him all the money he possesses: the feeling which causes a man to perform actions which from an ordinary point of view are insane, to test, as it were, his personal power and strength, affirming the existence of a higher, nonhuman criterion of life.\n\nFrom the very day Pierre had experienced this feeling for the first time at the Slob\u00f3da Palace he had been continuously under its influence, but only now found full satisfaction for it. Moreover, at this moment Pierre was supported in his design and prevented from renouncing it by what he had already done in that direction. If he were now to leave Moscow like everyone else, his flight from home, the peasant coat, the pistol, and his announcement to the Rost\u00f3vs that he would remain in Moscow would all become not merely meaningless but contemptible and ridiculous, and to this Pierre was very sensitive.\n\nPierre\u2019s physical condition, as is always the case, corresponded to his mental state. The unaccustomed coarse food, the vodka he drank during those days, the absence of wine and cigars, his dirty unchanged linen, two almost sleepless nights passed on a short sofa without bedding\u2014all this kept him in a state of excitement bordering on insanity.\n\nIt was two o\u2019clock in the afternoon. The French had already entered Moscow. Pierre knew this, but instead of acting he only thought about his undertaking, going over its minutest details in his mind. In his fancy he did not clearly picture to himself either the striking of the blow or the death of Napoleon, but with extraordinary vividness and melancholy enjoyment imagined his own destruction and heroic endurance.\n\n\u201cYes, alone, for the sake of all, I must do it or perish!\u201d he thought. \u201cYes, I will approach... and then suddenly... with pistol or dagger? But that is all the same! \u2018It is not I but the hand of Providence that punishes thee,\u2019 I shall say,\u201d thought he, imagining what he would say when killing Napoleon. \u201cWell then, take me and execute me!\u201d he went on, speaking to himself and bowing his head with a sad but firm expression.\n\nWhile Pierre, standing in the middle of the room, was talking to himself in this way, the study door opened and on the threshold appeared the figure of Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich, always so timid before but now quite transformed.\n\nHis dressing gown was unfastened, his face red and distorted. He was obviously drunk. On seeing Pierre he grew confused at first, but noticing embarrassment on Pierre\u2019s face immediately grew bold and, staggering on his thin legs, advanced into the middle of the room.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re frightened,\u201d he said confidentially in a hoarse voice. \u201cI say I won\u2019t surrender, I say... Am I not right, sir?\u201d\n\nHe paused and then suddenly seeing the pistol on the table seized it with unexpected rapidity and ran out into the corridor.\n\nGer\u00e1sim and the porter, who had followed Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich, stopped him in the vestibule and tried to take the pistol from him. Pierre, coming out into the corridor, looked with pity and repulsion at the half-crazy old man. Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich, frowning with exertion, held on to the pistol and screamed hoarsely, evidently with some heroic fancy in his head.\n\n\u201cTo arms! Board them! No, you shan\u2019t get it,\u201d he yelled.\n\n\u201cThat will do, please, that will do. Have the goodness\u2014please, sir, to let go! Please, sir...\u201d pleaded Ger\u00e1sim, trying carefully to steer Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich by the elbows back to the door.\n\n\u201cWho are you? Bonaparte!...\u201d shouted Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not right, sir. Come to your room, please, and rest. Allow me to have the pistol.\u201d\n\n\u201cBe off, thou base slave! Touch me not! See this?\u201d shouted Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich, brandishing the pistol. \u201cBoard them!\u201d\n\n\u201cCatch hold!\u201d whispered Ger\u00e1sim to the porter.\n\nThey seized Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich by the arms and dragged him to the door.\n\nThe vestibule was filled with the discordant sounds of a struggle and of a tipsy, hoarse voice.\n\nSuddenly a fresh sound, a piercing feminine scream, reverberated from the porch and the cook came running into the vestibule.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s them! Gracious heavens! O Lord, four of them, horsemen!\u201d she cried.\n\nGer\u00e1sim and the porter let Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich go, and in the now silent corridor the sound of several hands knocking at the front door could be heard.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXVIII\n\nPierre, having decided that until he had carried out his design he would disclose neither his identity nor his knowledge of French, stood at the half-open door of the corridor, intending to conceal himself as soon as the French entered. But the French entered and still Pierre did not retire\u2014an irresistible curiosity kept him there.\n\nThere were two of them. One was an officer\u2014a tall, soldierly, handsome man\u2014the other evidently a private or an orderly, sunburned, short, and thin, with sunken cheeks and a dull expression. The officer walked in front, leaning on a stick and slightly limping. When he had advanced a few steps he stopped, having apparently decided that these were good quarters, turned round to the soldiers standing at the entrance, and in a loud voice of command ordered them to put up the horses. Having done that, the officer, lifting his elbow with a smart gesture, stroked his mustache and lightly touched his hat.\n\n\u201cBonjour, la compagnie!\u201d said he gaily, smiling and looking about him.\n\nNo one gave any reply.\n\n\u201cVous \u00eates le bourgeois?\u201d the officer asked Ger\u00e1sim.\n\nGer\u00e1sim gazed at the officer with an alarmed and inquiring look.\n\n\u201cQuartier, quartier, logement!\u201d said the officer, looking down at the little man with a condescending and good-natured smile. \u201cLes fran\u00e7ais sont de bons enfants. Que diable! Voyons! Ne nous f\u00e2chons pas, mon vieux!\u201d added he, clapping the scared and silent Ger\u00e1sim on the shoulder. \u201cWell, does no one speak French in this establishment?\u201d he asked again in French, looking around and meeting Pierre\u2019s eyes. Pierre moved away from the door.\n\nAgain the officer turned to Ger\u00e1sim and asked him to show him the rooms in the house.\n\n\u201cMaster, not here\u2014don\u2019t understand... me, you...\u201d said Ger\u00e1sim, trying to render his words more comprehensible by contorting them.\n\nStill smiling, the French officer spread out his hands before Ger\u00e1sim\u2019s nose, intimating that he did not understand him either, and moved, limping, to the door at which Pierre was standing. Pierre wished to go away and conceal himself, but at that moment he saw Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich appearing at the open kitchen door with the pistol in his hand. With a madman\u2019s cunning, Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich eyed the Frenchman, raised his pistol, and took aim.\n\n\u201cBoard them!\u201d yelled the tipsy man, trying to press the trigger. Hearing the yell the officer turned round, and at the same moment Pierre threw himself on the drunkard. Just when Pierre snatched at and struck up the pistol Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich at last got his fingers on the trigger, there was a deafening report, and all were enveloped in a cloud of smoke. The Frenchman turned pale and rushed to the door.\n\nForgetting his intention of concealing his knowledge of French, Pierre, snatching away the pistol and throwing it down, ran up to the officer and addressed him in French.\n\n\u201cYou are not wounded?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cI think not,\u201d answered the Frenchman, feeling himself over. \u201cBut I have had a lucky escape this time,\u201d he added, pointing to the damaged plaster of the wall. \u201cWho is that man?\u201d said he, looking sternly at Pierre.\n\n\u201cOh, I am really in despair at what has occurred,\u201d said Pierre rapidly, quite forgetting the part he had intended to play. \u201cHe is an unfortunate madman who did not know what he was doing.\u201d\n\nThe officer went up to Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich and took him by the collar.\n\nMak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich was standing with parted lips, swaying, as if about to fall asleep, as he leaned against the wall.\n\n\u201cBrigand! You shall pay for this,\u201d said the Frenchman, letting go of him. \u201cWe French are merciful after victory, but we do not pardon traitors,\u201d he added, with a look of gloomy dignity and a fine energetic gesture.\n\nPierre continued, in French, to persuade the officer not to hold that drunken imbecile to account. The Frenchman listened in silence with the same gloomy expression, but suddenly turned to Pierre with a smile. For a few seconds he looked at him in silence. His handsome face assumed a melodramatically gentle expression and he held out his hand.\n\n\u201cYou have saved my life. You are French,\u201d said he.\n\nFor a Frenchman that deduction was indubitable. Only a Frenchman could perform a great deed, and to save his life\u2014the life of M. Ramballe, captain of the 13th Light Regiment\u2014was undoubtedly a very great deed.\n\nBut however indubitable that conclusion and the officer\u2019s conviction based upon it, Pierre felt it necessary to disillusion him.\n\n\u201cI am Russian,\u201d he said quickly.\n\n\u201cTut, tut, tut! Tell that to others,\u201d said the officer, waving his finger before his nose and smiling. \u201cYou shall tell me all about that presently. I am delighted to meet a compatriot. Well, and what are we to do with this man?\u201d he added, addressing himself to Pierre as to a brother.\n\nEven if Pierre were not a Frenchman, having once received that loftiest of human appellations he could not renounce it, said the officer\u2019s look and tone. In reply to his last question Pierre again explained who Mak\u00e1r Alex\u00e9evich was and how just before their arrival that drunken imbecile had seized the loaded pistol which they had not had time to recover from him, and begged the officer to let the deed go unpunished.\n\nThe Frenchman expanded his chest and made a majestic gesture with his arm.\n\n\u201cYou have saved my life! You are French. You ask his pardon? I grant it you. Lead that man away!\u201d said he quickly and energetically, and taking the arm of Pierre whom he had promoted to be a Frenchman for saving his life, he went with him into the room.\n\nThe soldiers in the yard, hearing the shot, came into the passage asking what had happened, and expressed their readiness to punish the culprits, but the officer sternly checked them.\n\n\u201cYou will be called in when you are wanted,\u201d he said.\n\nThe soldiers went out again, and the orderly, who had meanwhile had time to visit the kitchen, came up to his officer.\n\n\u201cCaptain, there is soup and a leg of mutton in the kitchen,\u201d said he. \u201cShall I serve them up?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and some wine,\u201d answered the captain.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXIX\n\nWhen the French officer went into the room with Pierre the latter again thought it his duty to assure him that he was not French and wished to go away, but the officer would not hear of it. He was so very polite, amiable, good-natured, and genuinely grateful to Pierre for saving his life that Pierre had not the heart to refuse, and sat down with him in the parlor\u2014the first room they entered. To Pierre\u2019s assurances that he was not a Frenchman, the captain, evidently not understanding how anyone could decline so flattering an appellation, shrugged his shoulders and said that if Pierre absolutely insisted on passing for a Russian let it be so, but for all that he would be forever bound to Pierre by gratitude for saving his life.\n\nHad this man been endowed with the slightest capacity for perceiving the feelings of others, and had he at all understood what Pierre\u2019s feelings were, the latter would probably have left him, but the man\u2019s animated obtuseness to everything other than himself disarmed Pierre.\n\n\u201cA Frenchman or a Russian prince incognito,\u201d said the officer, looking at Pierre\u2019s fine though dirty linen and at the ring on his finger. \u201cI owe my life to you and offer you my friendship. A Frenchman never forgets either an insult or a service. I offer you my friendship. That is all I can say.\u201d\n\nThere was so much good nature and nobility (in the French sense of the word) in the officer\u2019s voice, in the expression of his face and in his gestures, that Pierre, unconsciously smiling in response to the Frenchman\u2019s smile, pressed the hand held out to him.\n\n\u201cCaptain Ramballe, of the 13th Light Regiment, Chevalier of the Legion of Honor for the affair on the seventh of September,\u201d he introduced himself, a self-satisfied irrepressible smile puckering his lips under his mustache. \u201cWill you now be so good as to tell me with whom I have the honor of conversing so pleasantly, instead of being in the ambulance with that maniac\u2019s bullet in my body?\u201d\n\nPierre replied that he could not tell him his name and, blushing, began to try to invent a name and to say something about his reason for concealing it, but the Frenchman hastily interrupted him.\n\n\u201cOh, please!\u201d said he. \u201cI understand your reasons. You are an officer... a superior officer perhaps. You have borne arms against us. That\u2019s not my business. I owe you my life. That is enough for me. I am quite at your service. You belong to the gentry?\u201d he concluded with a shade of inquiry in his tone. Pierre bent his head. \u201cYour baptismal name, if you please. That is all I ask. Monsieur Pierre, you say.... That\u2019s all I want to know.\u201d\n\nWhen the mutton and an omelet had been served and a samovar and vodka brought, with some wine which the French had taken from a Russian cellar and brought with them, Ramballe invited Pierre to share his dinner, and himself began to eat greedily and quickly like a healthy and hungry man, munching his food rapidly with his strong teeth, continually smacking his lips, and repeating\u2014\u201cExcellent! Delicious!\u201d His face grew red and was covered with perspiration. Pierre was hungry and shared the dinner with pleasure. Morel, the orderly, brought some hot water in a saucepan and placed a bottle of claret in it. He also brought a bottle of kvass, taken from the kitchen for them to try. That beverage was already known to the French and had been given a special name. They called it limonade de cochon (pig\u2019s lemonade), and Morel spoke well of the limonade de cochon he had found in the kitchen. But as the captain had the wine they had taken while passing through Moscow, he left the kvass to Morel and applied himself to the bottle of Bordeaux. He wrapped the bottle up to its neck in a table napkin and poured out wine for himself and for Pierre. The satisfaction of his hunger and the wine rendered the captain still more lively and he chatted incessantly all through dinner.\n\n\u201cYes, my dear Monsieur Pierre, I owe you a fine votive candle for saving me from that maniac.... You see, I have bullets enough in my body already. Here is one I got at Wagram\u201d (he touched his side) \u201cand a second at Smol\u00e9nsk\u201d\u2014he showed a scar on his cheek\u2014\u201cand this leg which as you see does not want to march, I got that on the seventh at the great battle of la Moskowa. Sacr\u00e9 Dieu! It was splendid! That deluge of fire was worth seeing. It was a tough job you set us there, my word! You may be proud of it! And on my honor, in spite of the cough I caught there, I should be ready to begin again. I pity those who did not see it.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was there,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cBah, really? So much the better! You are certainly brave foes. The great redoubt held out well, by my pipe!\u201d continued the Frenchman. \u201cAnd you made us pay dear for it. I was at it three times\u2014sure as I sit here. Three times we reached the guns and three times we were thrown back like cardboard figures. Oh, it was beautiful, Monsieur Pierre! Your grenadiers were splendid, by heaven! I saw them close up their ranks six times in succession and march as if on parade. Fine fellows! Our King of Naples, who knows what\u2019s what, cried \u2018Bravo!\u2019 Ha, ha! So you are one of us soldiers!\u201d he added, smiling, after a momentary pause. \u201cSo much the better, so much the better, Monsieur Pierre! Terrible in battle... gallant... with the fair\u201d (he winked and smiled), \u201cthat\u2019s what the French are, Monsieur Pierre, aren\u2019t they?\u201d\n\nThe captain was so na\u00efvely and good-humoredly gay, so real, and so pleased with himself that Pierre almost winked back as he looked merrily at him. Probably the word \u201cgallant\u201d turned the captain\u2019s thoughts to the state of Moscow.\n\n\u201cApropos, tell me please, is it true that the women have all left Moscow? What a queer idea! What had they to be afraid of?\u201d\n\n\u201cWould not the French ladies leave Paris if the Russians entered it?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cHa, ha, ha!\u201d The Frenchman emitted a merry, sanguine chuckle, patting Pierre on the shoulder. \u201cWhat a thing to say!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cParis?... But Paris, Paris...\u201d\n\n\u201cParis\u2014the capital of the world,\u201d Pierre finished his remark for him.\n\nThe captain looked at Pierre. He had a habit of stopping short in the middle of his talk and gazing intently with his laughing, kindly eyes.\n\n\u201cWell, if you hadn\u2019t told me you were Russian, I should have wagered that you were Parisian! You have that... I don\u2019t know what, that...\u201d and having uttered this compliment, he again gazed at him in silence.\n\n\u201cI have been in Paris. I spent years there,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cOh yes, one sees that plainly. Paris!... A man who doesn\u2019t know Paris is a savage. You can tell a Parisian two leagues off. Paris is Talma, la Duch\u00e9nois, Potier, the Sorbonne, the boulevards,\u201d and noticing that his conclusion was weaker than what had gone before, he added quickly: \u201cThere is only one Paris in the world. You have been to Paris and have remained Russian. Well, I don\u2019t esteem you the less for it.\u201d\n\nUnder the influence of the wine he had drunk, and after the days he had spent alone with his depressing thoughts, Pierre involuntarily enjoyed talking with this cheerful and good-natured man.\n\n\u201cTo return to your ladies\u2014I hear they are lovely. What a wretched idea to go and bury themselves in the steppes when the French army is in Moscow. What a chance those girls have missed! Your peasants, now\u2014that\u2019s another thing; but you civilized people, you ought to know us better than that. We took Vienna, Berlin, Madrid, Naples, Rome, Warsaw, all the world\u2019s capitals.... We are feared, but we are loved. We are nice to know. And then the Emperor...\u201d he began, but Pierre interrupted him.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor,\u201d Pierre repeated, and his face suddenly became sad and embarrassed, \u201cis the Emperor...?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Emperor? He is generosity, mercy, justice, order, genius\u2014that\u2019s what the Emperor is! It is I, Ramballe, who tell you so.... I assure you I was his enemy eight years ago. My father was an emigrant count.... But that man has vanquished me. He has taken hold of me. I could not resist the sight of the grandeur and glory with which he has covered France. When I understood what he wanted\u2014when I saw that he was preparing a bed of laurels for us, you know, I said to myself: \u2018That is a monarch,\u2019 and I devoted myself to him! So there! Oh yes, mon cher, he is the greatest man of the ages past or future.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he in Moscow?\u201d Pierre stammered with a guilty look.\n\nThe Frenchman looked at his guilty face and smiled.\n\n\u201cNo, he will make his entry tomorrow,\u201d he replied, and continued his talk.\n\nTheir conversation was interrupted by the cries of several voices at the gate and by Morel, who came to say that some W\u00fcrttemberg hussars had come and wanted to put up their horses in the yard where the captain\u2019s horses were. This difficulty had arisen chiefly because the hussars did not understand what was said to them in French.\n\nThe captain had their senior sergeant called in, and in a stern voice asked him to what regiment he belonged, who was his commanding officer, and by what right he allowed himself to claim quarters that were already occupied. The German who knew little French, answered the two first questions by giving the names of his regiment and of his commanding officer, but in reply to the third question which he did not understand said, introducing broken French into his own German, that he was the quartermaster of the regiment and his commander had ordered him to occupy all the houses one after another. Pierre, who knew German, translated what the German said to the captain and gave the captain\u2019s reply to the W\u00fcrttemberg hussar in German. When he had understood what was said to him, the German submitted and took his men elsewhere. The captain went out into the porch and gave some orders in a loud voice.\n\nWhen he returned to the room Pierre was sitting in the same place as before, with his head in his hands. His face expressed suffering. He really was suffering at that moment. When the captain went out and he was left alone, suddenly he came to himself and realized the position he was in. It was not that Moscow had been taken or that the happy conquerors were masters in it and were patronizing him. Painful as that was it was not that which tormented Pierre at the moment. He was tormented by the consciousness of his own weakness. The few glasses of wine he had drunk and the conversation with this good-natured man had destroyed the mood of concentrated gloom in which he had spent the last few days and which was essential for the execution of his design. The pistol, dagger, and peasant coat were ready. Napoleon was to enter the town next day. Pierre still considered that it would be a useful and worthy action to slay the evildoer, but now he felt that he would not do it. He did not know why, but he felt a foreboding that he would not carry out his intention. He struggled against the confession of his weakness but dimly felt that he could not overcome it and that his former gloomy frame of mind, concerning vengeance, killing, and self-sacrifice, had been dispersed like dust by contact with the first man he met.\n\nThe captain returned to the room, limping slightly and whistling a tune.\n\nThe Frenchman\u2019s chatter which had previously amused Pierre now repelled him. The tune he was whistling, his gait, and the gesture with which he twirled his mustache, all now seemed offensive. \u201cI will go away immediately. I won\u2019t say another word to him,\u201d thought Pierre. He thought this, but still sat in the same place. A strange feeling of weakness tied him to the spot; he wished to get up and go away, but could not do so.\n\nThe captain, on the other hand, seemed very cheerful. He paced up and down the room twice. His eyes shone and his mustache twitched as if he were smiling to himself at some amusing thought.\n\n\u201cThe colonel of those W\u00fcrttembergers is delightful,\u201d he suddenly said. \u201cHe\u2019s a German, but a nice fellow all the same.... But he\u2019s a German.\u201d He sat down facing Pierre. \u201cBy the way, you know German, then?\u201d\n\nPierre looked at him in silence.\n\n\u201cWhat is the German for \u2018shelter\u2019?\u201d\n\n\u201cShelter?\u201d Pierre repeated. \u201cThe German for shelter is Unterkunft.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do you say it?\u201d the captain asked quickly and doubtfully.\n\n\u201cUnterkunft,\u201d Pierre repeated.\n\n\u201cOnterkoff,\u201d said the captain and looked at Pierre for some seconds with laughing eyes. \u201cThese Germans are first-rate fools, don\u2019t you think so, Monsieur Pierre?\u201d he concluded.\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s have another bottle of this Moscow Bordeaux, shall we? Morel will warm us up another little bottle. Morel!\u201d he called out gaily.\n\nMorel brought candles and a bottle of wine. The captain looked at Pierre by the candlelight and was evidently struck by the troubled expression on his companion\u2019s face. Ramballe, with genuine distress and sympathy in his face, went up to Pierre and bent over him.\n\n\u201cThere now, we\u2019re sad,\u201d said he, touching Pierre\u2019s hand. \u201cHave I upset you? No, really, have you anything against me?\u201d he asked Pierre. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s the state of affairs?\u201d\n\nPierre did not answer, but looked cordially into the Frenchman\u2019s eyes whose expression of sympathy was pleasing to him.\n\n\u201cHonestly, without speaking of what I owe you, I feel friendship for you. Can I do anything for you? Dispose of me. It is for life and death. I say it with my hand on my heart!\u201d said he, striking his chest.\n\n\u201cThank you,\u201d said Pierre.\n\nThe captain gazed intently at him as he had done when he learned that \u201cshelter\u201d was Unterkunft in German, and his face suddenly brightened.\n\n\u201cWell, in that case, I drink to our friendship!\u201d he cried gaily, filling two glasses with wine.\n\nPierre took one of the glasses and emptied it. Ramballe emptied his too, again pressed Pierre\u2019s hand, and leaned his elbows on the table in a pensive attitude.\n\n\u201cYes, my dear friend,\u201d he began, \u201csuch is fortune\u2019s caprice. Who would have said that I should be a soldier and a captain of dragoons in the service of Bonaparte, as we used to call him? Yet here I am in Moscow with him. I must tell you, mon cher,\u201d he continued in the sad and measured tones of a man who intends to tell a long story, \u201cthat our name is one of the most ancient in France.\u201d\n\nAnd with a Frenchman\u2019s easy and na\u00efve frankness the captain told Pierre the story of his ancestors, his childhood, youth, and manhood, and all about his relations and his financial and family affairs, \u201cma pauvre m\u00e8re\u201d playing of course an important part in the story.\n\n\u201cBut all that is only life\u2019s setting, the real thing is love\u2014love! Am I not right, Monsieur Pierre?\u201d said he, growing animated. \u201cAnother glass?\u201d\n\nPierre again emptied his glass and poured himself out a third.\n\n\u201cOh, women, women!\u201d and the captain, looking with glistening eyes at Pierre, began talking of love and of his love affairs.\n\nThere were very many of these, as one could easily believe, looking at the officer\u2019s handsome, self-satisfied face, and noting the eager enthusiasm with which he spoke of women. Though all Ramballe\u2019s love stories had the sensual character which Frenchmen regard as the special charm and poetry of love, yet he told his story with such sincere conviction that he alone had experienced and known all the charm of love and he described women so alluringly that Pierre listened to him with curiosity.\n\nIt was plain that l\u2019amour which the Frenchman was so fond of was not that low and simple kind that Pierre had once felt for his wife, nor was it the romantic love stimulated by himself that he experienced for Nat\u00e1sha. (Ramballe despised both these kinds of love equally: the one he considered the \u201clove of clodhoppers\u201d and the other the \u201clove of simpletons.\u201d) L\u2019amour which the Frenchman worshiped consisted principally in the unnaturalness of his relation to the woman and in a combination of incongruities giving the chief charm to the feeling.\n\nThus the captain touchingly recounted the story of his love for a fascinating marquise of thirty-five and at the same time for a charming, innocent child of seventeen, daughter of the bewitching marquise. The conflict of magnanimity between the mother and the daughter, ending in the mother\u2019s sacrificing herself and offering her daughter in marriage to her lover, even now agitated the captain, though it was the memory of a distant past. Then he recounted an episode in which the husband played the part of the lover, and he\u2014the lover\u2014assumed the role of the husband, as well as several droll incidents from his recollections of Germany, where \u201cshelter\u201d is called Unterkunft and where the husbands eat sauerkraut and the young girls are \u201ctoo blonde.\u201d\n\nFinally, the latest episode in Poland still fresh in the captain\u2019s memory, and which he narrated with rapid gestures and glowing face, was of how he had saved the life of a Pole (in general, the saving of life continually occurred in the captain\u2019s stories) and the Pole had entrusted to him his enchanting wife (parisienne de c\u0153ur) while himself entering the French service. The captain was happy, the enchanting Polish lady wished to elope with him, but, prompted by magnanimity, the captain restored the wife to the husband, saying as he did so: \u201cI have saved your life, and I save your honor!\u201d Having repeated these words the captain wiped his eyes and gave himself a shake, as if driving away the weakness which assailed him at this touching recollection.\n\nListening to the captain\u2019s tales, Pierre\u2014as often happens late in the evening and under the influence of wine\u2014followed all that was told him, understood it all, and at the same time followed a train of personal memories which, he knew not why, suddenly arose in his mind. While listening to these love stories his own love for Nat\u00e1sha unexpectedly rose to his mind, and going over the pictures of that love in his imagination he mentally compared them with Ramballe\u2019s tales. Listening to the story of the struggle between love and duty, Pierre saw before his eyes every minutest detail of his last meeting with the object of his love at the S\u00fakharev water tower. At the time of that meeting it had not produced an effect upon him\u2014he had not even once recalled it. But now it seemed to him that that meeting had had in it something very important and poetic.\n\n\u201cPeter Kir\u00edlovich, come here! We have recognized you,\u201d he now seemed to hear the words she had uttered and to see before him her eyes, her smile, her traveling hood, and a stray lock of her hair... and there seemed to him something pathetic and touching in all this.\n\nHaving finished his tale about the enchanting Polish lady, the captain asked Pierre if he had ever experienced a similar impulse to sacrifice himself for love and a feeling of envy of the legitimate husband.\n\nChallenged by this question Pierre raised his head and felt a need to express the thoughts that filled his mind. He began to explain that he understood love for a woman somewhat differently. He said that in all his life he had loved and still loved only one woman, and that she could never be his.\n\n\u201cTiens!\u201d said the captain.\n\nPierre then explained that he had loved this woman from his earliest years, but that he had not dared to think of her because she was too young, and because he had been an illegitimate son without a name. Afterwards when he had received a name and wealth he dared not think of her because he loved her too well, placing her far above everything in the world, and especially therefore above himself.\n\nWhen he had reached this point, Pierre asked the captain whether he understood that.\n\nThe captain made a gesture signifying that even if he did not understand it he begged Pierre to continue.\n\n\u201cPlat\u00f3nic love, clouds...\u201d he muttered.\n\nWhether it was the wine he had drunk, or an impulse of frankness, or the thought that this man did not, and never would, know any of those who played a part in his story, or whether it was all these things together, something loosened Pierre\u2019s tongue. Speaking thickly and with a faraway look in his shining eyes, he told the whole story of his life: his marriage, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s love for his best friend, her betrayal of him, and all his own simple relations with her. Urged on by Ramballe\u2019s questions he also told what he had at first concealed\u2014his own position and even his name.\n\nMore than anything else in Pierre\u2019s story the captain was impressed by the fact that Pierre was very rich, had two mansions in Moscow, and that he had abandoned everything and not left the city, but remained there concealing his name and station.\n\nWhen it was late at night they went out together into the street. The night was warm and light. To the left of the house on the Pokr\u00f3vka a fire glowed\u2014the first of those that were beginning in Moscow. To the right and high up in the sky was the sickle of the waning moon and opposite to it hung that bright comet which was connected in Pierre\u2019s heart with his love. At the gate stood Ger\u00e1sim, the cook, and two Frenchmen. Their laughter and their mutually incomprehensible remarks in two languages could be heard. They were looking at the glow seen in the town.\n\nThere was nothing terrible in the one small, distant fire in the immense city.\n\nGazing at the high starry sky, at the moon, at the comet, and at the glow from the fire, Pierre experienced a joyful emotion. \u201cThere now, how good it is, what more does one need?\u201d thought he. And suddenly remembering his intention he grew dizzy and felt so faint that he leaned against the fence to save himself from falling.\n\nWithout taking leave of his new friend, Pierre left the gate with unsteady steps and returning to his room lay down on the sofa and immediately fell asleep.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXX\n\nThe glow of the first fire that began on the second of September was watched from the various roads by the fugitive Muscovites and by the retreating troops, with many different feelings.\n\nThe Rost\u00f3v party spent the night at Myt\u00edshchi, fourteen miles from Moscow. They had started so late on the first of September, the road had been so blocked by vehicles and troops, so many things had been forgotten for which servants were sent back, that they had decided to spend that night at a place three miles out of Moscow. The next morning they woke late and were again delayed so often that they only got as far as Great Myt\u00edshchi. At ten o\u2019clock that evening the Rost\u00f3v family and the wounded traveling with them were all distributed in the yards and huts of that large village. The Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 servants and coachmen and the orderlies of the wounded officers, after attending to their masters, had supper, fed the horses, and came out into the porches.\n\nIn a neighboring hut lay Ra\u00e9vski\u2019s adjutant with a fractured wrist. The awful pain he suffered made him moan incessantly and piteously, and his moaning sounded terrible in the darkness of the autumn night. He had spent the first night in the same yard as the Rost\u00f3vs. The countess said she had been unable to close her eyes on account of his moaning, and at Myt\u00edshchi she moved into a worse hut simply to be farther away from the wounded man.\n\nIn the darkness of the night one of the servants noticed, above the high body of a coach standing before the porch, the small glow of another fire. One glow had long been visible and everybody knew that it was Little Myt\u00edshchi burning\u2014set on fire by Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s Cossacks.\n\n\u201cBut look here, brothers, there\u2019s another fire!\u201d remarked an orderly.\n\nAll turned their attention to the glow.\n\n\u201cBut they told us Little Myt\u00edshchi had been set on fire by Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s Cossacks.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut that\u2019s not Myt\u00edshchi, it\u2019s farther away.\u201d\n\n\u201cLook, it must be in Moscow!\u201d\n\nTwo of the gazers went round to the other side of the coach and sat down on its steps.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more to the left, why, Little Myt\u00edshchi is over there, and this is right on the other side.\u201d\n\nSeveral men joined the first two.\n\n\u201cSee how it\u2019s flaring,\u201d said one. \u201cThat\u2019s a fire in Moscow: either in the Sushch\u00e9vski or the Rog\u00f3zhski quarter.\u201d\n\nNo one replied to this remark and for some time they all gazed silently at the spreading flames of the second fire in the distance.\n\nOld Daniel Ter\u00e9ntich, the count\u2019s valet (as he was called), came up to the group and shouted at M\u00edshka.\n\n\u201cWhat are you staring at, you good-for-nothing?... The count will be calling and there\u2019s nobody there; go and gather the clothes together.\u201d\n\n\u201cI only ran out to get some water,\u201d said M\u00edshka.\n\n\u201cBut what do you think, Daniel Ter\u00e9ntich? Doesn\u2019t it look as if that glow were in Moscow?\u201d remarked one of the footmen.\n\nDaniel Ter\u00e9ntich made no reply, and again for a long time they were all silent. The glow spread, rising and falling, farther and farther still.\n\n\u201cGod have mercy.... It\u2019s windy and dry...\u201d said another voice.\n\n\u201cJust look! See what it\u2019s doing now. O Lord! You can even see the crows flying. Lord have mercy on us sinners!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll put it out, no fear!\u201d\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s to put it out?\u201d Daniel Ter\u00e9ntich, who had hitherto been silent, was heard to say. His voice was calm and deliberate. \u201cMoscow it is, brothers,\u201d said he. \u201cMother Moscow, the white...\u201d his voice faltered, and he gave way to an old man\u2019s sob.\n\nAnd it was as if they had all only waited for this to realize the significance for them of the glow they were watching. Sighs were heard, words of prayer, and the sobbing of the count\u2019s old valet.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXI\n\nThe valet, returning to the cottage, informed the count that Moscow was burning. The count donned his dressing gown and went out to look. S\u00f3nya and Madame Schoss, who had not yet undressed, went out with him. Only Nat\u00e1sha and the countess remained in the room. P\u00e9tya was no longer with the family, he had gone on with his regiment which was making for Tr\u00f3itsa.\n\nThe countess, on hearing that Moscow was on fire, began to cry. Nat\u00e1sha, pale, with a fixed look, was sitting on the bench under the icons just where she had sat down on arriving and paid no attention to her father\u2019s words. She was listening to the ceaseless moaning of the adjutant, three houses off.\n\n\u201cOh, how terrible,\u201d said S\u00f3nya returning from the yard chilled and frightened. \u201cI believe the whole of Moscow will burn, there\u2019s an awful glow! Nat\u00e1sha, do look! You can see it from the window,\u201d she said to her cousin, evidently wishing to distract her mind.\n\nBut Nat\u00e1sha looked at her as if not understanding what was said to her and again fixed her eyes on the corner of the stove. She had been in this condition of stupor since the morning,", "sequence": 23}, {"offset": 2400000, "text": " when S\u00f3nya, to the surprise and annoyance of the countess, had for some unaccountable reason found it necessary to tell Nat\u00e1sha of Prince Andrew\u2019s wound and of his being with their party. The countess had seldom been so angry with anyone as she was with S\u00f3nya. S\u00f3nya had cried and begged to be forgiven and now, as if trying to atone for her fault, paid unceasing attention to her cousin.\n\n\u201cLook, Nat\u00e1sha, how dreadfully it is burning!\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s burning?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cOh, yes, Moscow.\u201d\n\nAnd as if in order not to offend S\u00f3nya and to get rid of her, she turned her face to the window, looked out in such a way that it was evident that she could not see anything, and again settled down in her former attitude.\n\n\u201cBut you didn\u2019t see it!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, really I did,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha replied in a voice that pleaded to be left in peace.\n\nBoth the countess and S\u00f3nya understood that, naturally, neither Moscow nor the burning of Moscow nor anything else could seem of importance to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nThe count returned and lay down behind the partition. The countess went up to her daughter and touched her head with the back of her hand as she was wont to do when Nat\u00e1sha was ill, then touched her forehead with her lips as if to feel whether she was feverish, and finally kissed her.\n\n\u201cYou are cold. You are trembling all over. You\u2019d better lie down,\u201d said the countess.\n\n\u201cLie down? All right, I will. I\u2019ll lie down at once,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nWhen Nat\u00e1sha had been told that morning that Prince Andrew was seriously wounded and was traveling with their party, she had at first asked many questions: Where was he going? How was he wounded? Was it serious? And could she see him? But after she had been told that she could not see him, that he was seriously wounded but that his life was not in danger, she ceased to ask questions or to speak at all, evidently disbelieving what they told her, and convinced that say what she might she would still be told the same. All the way she had sat motionless in a corner of the coach with wide open eyes, and the expression in them which the countess knew so well and feared so much, and now she sat in the same way on the bench where she had seated herself on arriving. She was planning something and either deciding or had already decided something in her mind. The countess knew this, but what it might be she did not know, and this alarmed and tormented her.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, undress, darling; lie down on my bed.\u201d\n\nA bed had been made on a bedstead for the countess only. Madame Schoss and the two girls were to sleep on some hay on the floor.\n\n\u201cNo, Mamma, I will lie down here on the floor,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha replied irritably and she went to the window and opened it. Through the open window the moans of the adjutant could be heard more distinctly. She put her head out into the damp night air, and the countess saw her slim neck shaking with sobs and throbbing against the window frame. Nat\u00e1sha knew it was not Prince Andrew who was moaning. She knew Prince Andrew was in the same yard as themselves and in a part of the hut across the passage; but this dreadful incessant moaning made her sob. The countess exchanged a look with S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cLie down, darling; lie down, my pet,\u201d said the countess, softly touching Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s shoulders. \u201cCome, lie down.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes... I\u2019ll lie down at once,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, and began hurriedly undressing, tugging at the tapes of her petticoat.\n\nWhen she had thrown off her dress and put on a dressing jacket, she sat down with her foot under her on the bed that had been made up on the floor, jerked her thin and rather short plait of hair to the front, and began replaiting it. Her long, thin, practiced fingers rapidly unplaited, replaited, and tied up her plait. Her head moved from side to side from habit, but her eyes, feverishly wide, looked fixedly before her. When her toilet for the night was finished she sank gently onto the sheet spread over the hay on the side nearest the door.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, you\u2019d better lie in the middle,\u201d said S\u00f3nya.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll stay here,\u201d muttered Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo lie down,\u201d she added crossly, and buried her face in the pillow.\n\nThe countess, Madame Schoss, and S\u00f3nya undressed hastily and lay down. The small lamp in front of the icons was the only light left in the room. But in the yard there was a light from the fire at Little Myt\u00edshchi a mile and a half away, and through the night came the noise of people shouting at a tavern Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s Cossacks had set up across the street, and the adjutant\u2019s unceasing moans could still be heard.\n\nFor a long time Nat\u00e1sha listened attentively to the sounds that reached her from inside and outside the room and did not move. First she heard her mother praying and sighing and the creaking of her bed under her, then Madame Schoss\u2019 familiar whistling snore and S\u00f3nya\u2019s gentle breathing. Then the countess called to Nat\u00e1sha. Nat\u00e1sha did not answer.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s asleep, Mamma,\u201d said S\u00f3nya softly.\n\nAfter a short silence the countess spoke again but this time no one replied.\n\nSoon after that Nat\u00e1sha heard her mother\u2019s even breathing. Nat\u00e1sha did not move, though her little bare foot, thrust out from under the quilt, was growing cold on the bare floor.\n\nAs if to celebrate a victory over everybody, a cricket chirped in a crack in the wall. A cock crowed far off and another replied near by. The shouting in the tavern had died down; only the moaning of the adjutant was heard. Nat\u00e1sha sat up.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, are you asleep? Mamma?\u201d she whispered.\n\nNo one replied. Nat\u00e1sha rose slowly and carefully, crossed herself, and stepped cautiously on the cold and dirty floor with her slim, supple, bare feet. The boards of the floor creaked. Stepping cautiously from one foot to the other she ran like a kitten the few steps to the door and grasped the cold door handle.\n\nIt seemed to her that something heavy was beating rhythmically against all the walls of the room: it was her own heart, sinking with alarm and terror and overflowing with love.\n\nShe opened the door and stepped across the threshold and onto the cold, damp earthen floor of the passage. The cold she felt refreshed her. With her bare feet she touched a sleeping man, stepped over him, and opened the door into the part of the hut where Prince Andrew lay. It was dark in there. In the farthest corner, on a bench beside a bed on which something was lying, stood a tallow candle with a long, thick, and smoldering wick.\n\nFrom the moment she had been told that morning of Prince Andrew\u2019s wound and his presence there, Nat\u00e1sha had resolved to see him. She did not know why she had to, she knew the meeting would be painful, but felt the more convinced that it was necessary.\n\nAll day she had lived only in hope of seeing him that night. But now that the moment had come she was filled with dread of what she might see. How was he maimed? What was left of him? Was he like that incessant moaning of the adjutant\u2019s? Yes, he was altogether like that. In her imagination he was that terrible moaning personified. When she saw an indistinct shape in the corner, and mistook his knees raised under the quilt for his shoulders, she imagined a horrible body there, and stood still in terror. But an irresistible impulse drew her forward. She cautiously took one step and then another, and found herself in the middle of a small room containing baggage. Another man\u2014Tim\u00f3khin\u2014was lying in a corner on the benches beneath the icons, and two others\u2014the doctor and a valet\u2014lay on the floor.\n\nThe valet sat up and whispered something. Tim\u00f3khin, kept awake by the pain in his wounded leg, gazed with wide-open eyes at this strange apparition of a girl in a white chemise, dressing jacket, and nightcap. The valet\u2019s sleepy, frightened exclamation, \u201cWhat do you want? What\u2019s the matter?\u201d made Nat\u00e1sha approach more swiftly to what was lying in the corner. Horribly unlike a man as that body looked, she must see him. She passed the valet, the snuff fell from the candle wick, and she saw Prince Andrew clearly with his arms outside the quilt, and such as she had always seen him.\n\nHe was the same as ever, but the feverish color of his face, his glittering eyes rapturously turned toward her, and especially his neck, delicate as a child\u2019s, revealed by the turn-down collar of his shirt, gave him a peculiarly innocent, childlike look, such as she had never seen on him before. She went up to him and with a swift, flexible, youthful movement dropped on her knees.\n\nHe smiled and held out his hand to her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXII\n\nSeven days had passed since Prince Andrew found himself in the ambulance station on the field of Borodin\u00f3. His feverish state and the inflammation of his bowels, which were injured, were in the doctor\u2019s opinion sure to carry him off. But on the seventh day he ate with pleasure a piece of bread with some tea, and the doctor noticed that his temperature was lower. He had regained consciousness that morning. The first night after they left Moscow had been fairly warm and he had remained in the cal\u00e8che, but at Myt\u00edshchi the wounded man himself asked to be taken out and given some tea. The pain caused by his removal into the hut had made him groan aloud and again lose consciousness. When he had been placed on his camp bed he lay for a long time motionless with closed eyes. Then he opened them and whispered softly: \u201cAnd the tea?\u201d His remembering such a small detail of everyday life astonished the doctor. He felt Prince Andrew\u2019s pulse, and to his surprise and dissatisfaction found it had improved. He was dissatisfied because he knew by experience that if his patient did not die now, he would do so a little later with greater suffering. Tim\u00f3khin, the red-nosed major of Prince Andrew\u2019s regiment, had joined him in Moscow and was being taken along with him, having been wounded in the leg at the battle of Borodin\u00f3. They were accompanied by a doctor, Prince Andrew\u2019s valet, his coachman, and two orderlies.\n\nThey gave Prince Andrew some tea. He drank it eagerly, looking with feverish eyes at the door in front of him as if trying to understand and remember something.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want any more. Is Tim\u00f3khin here?\u201d he asked.\n\nTim\u00f3khin crept along the bench to him.\n\n\u201cI am here, your excellency.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow\u2019s your wound?\u201d\n\n\u201cMine, sir? All right. But how about you?\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew again pondered as if trying to remember something.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t one get a book?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cWhat book?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Gospels. I haven\u2019t one.\u201d\n\nThe doctor promised to procure it for him and began to ask how he was feeling. Prince Andrew answered all his questions reluctantly but reasonably, and then said he wanted a bolster placed under him as he was uncomfortable and in great pain. The doctor and valet lifted the cloak with which he was covered and, making wry faces at the noisome smell of mortifying flesh that came from the wound, began examining that dreadful place. The doctor was very much displeased about something and made a change in the dressings, turning the wounded man over so that he groaned again and grew unconscious and delirious from the agony. He kept asking them to get him the book and put it under him.\n\n\u201cWhat trouble would it be to you?\u201d he said. \u201cI have not got one. Please get it for me and put it under for a moment,\u201d he pleaded in a piteous voice.\n\nThe doctor went into the passage to wash his hands.\n\n\u201cYou fellows have no conscience,\u201d said he to the valet who was pouring water over his hands. \u201cFor just one moment I didn\u2019t look after you... It\u2019s such pain, you know, that I wonder how he can bear it.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy the Lord Jesus Christ, I thought we had put something under him!\u201d said the valet.\n\nThe first time Prince Andrew understood where he was and what was the matter with him and remembered being wounded and how was when he asked to be carried into the hut after his cal\u00e8che had stopped at Myt\u00edshchi. After growing confused from pain while being carried into the hut he again regained consciousness, and while drinking tea once more recalled all that had happened to him, and above all vividly remembered the moment at the ambulance station when, at the sight of the sufferings of a man he disliked, those new thoughts had come to him which promised him happiness. And those thoughts, though now vague and indefinite, again possessed his soul. He remembered that he had now a new source of happiness and that this happiness had something to do with the Gospels. That was why he asked for a copy of them. The uncomfortable position in which they had put him and turned him over again confused his thoughts, and when he came to himself a third time it was in the complete stillness of the night. Everybody near him was sleeping. A cricket chirped from across the passage; someone was shouting and singing in the street; cockroaches rustled on the table, on the icons, and on the walls, and a big fly flopped at the head of the bed and around the candle beside him, the wick of which was charred and had shaped itself like a mushroom.\n\nHis mind was not in a normal state. A healthy man usually thinks of, feels, and remembers innumerable things simultaneously, but has the power and will to select one sequence of thoughts or events on which to fix his whole attention. A healthy man can tear himself away from the deepest reflections to say a civil word to someone who comes in and can then return again to his own thoughts. But Prince Andrew\u2019s mind was not in a normal state in that respect. All the powers of his mind were more active and clearer than ever, but they acted apart from his will. Most diverse thoughts and images occupied him simultaneously. At times his brain suddenly began to work with a vigor, clearness, and depth it had never reached when he was in health, but suddenly in the midst of its work it would turn to some unexpected idea and he had not the strength to turn it back again.\n\n\u201cYes, a new happiness was revealed to me of which man cannot be deprived,\u201d he thought as he lay in the semidarkness of the quiet hut, gazing fixedly before him with feverish wide open eyes. \u201cA happiness lying beyond material forces, outside the material influences that act on man\u2014a happiness of the soul alone, the happiness of loving. Every man can understand it, but to conceive it and enjoin it was possible only for God. But how did God enjoin that law? And why was the Son...?\u201d\n\nAnd suddenly the sequence of these thoughts broke off, and Prince Andrew heard (without knowing whether it was a delusion or reality) a soft whispering voice incessantly and rhythmically repeating \u201cpiti-piti-piti,\u201d and then \u201ctiti,\u201d and then again \u201cpiti-piti-piti,\u201d and \u201cti-ti\u201d once more. At the same time he felt that above his face, above the very middle of it, some strange airy structure was being erected out of slender needles or splinters, to the sound of this whispered music. He felt that he had to balance carefully (though it was difficult) so that this airy structure should not collapse; but nevertheless it kept collapsing and again slowly rising to the sound of whispered rhythmic music\u2014\u201cit stretches, stretches, spreading out and stretching,\u201d said Prince Andrew to himself. While listening to this whispering and feeling the sensation of this drawing out and the construction of this edifice of needles, he also saw by glimpses a red halo round the candle, and heard the rustle of the cockroaches and the buzzing of the fly that flopped against his pillow and his face. Each time the fly touched his face it gave him a burning sensation and yet to his surprise it did not destroy the structure, though it knocked against the very region of his face where it was rising. But besides this there was something else of importance. It was something white by the door\u2014the statue of a sphinx, which also oppressed him.\n\n\u201cBut perhaps that\u2019s my shirt on the table,\u201d he thought, \u201cand that\u2019s my legs, and that is the door, but why is it always stretching and drawing itself out, and \u2018piti-piti-piti\u2019 and \u2018ti-ti\u2019 and \u2018piti-piti-piti\u2019...? That\u2019s enough, please leave off!\u201d Prince Andrew painfully entreated someone. And suddenly thoughts and feelings again swam to the surface of his mind with peculiar clearness and force.\n\n\u201cYes\u2014love,\u201d he thought again quite clearly. \u201cBut not love which loves for something, for some quality, for some purpose, or for some reason, but the love which I\u2014while dying\u2014first experienced when I saw my enemy and yet loved him. I experienced that feeling of love which is the very essence of the soul and does not require an object. Now again I feel that bliss. To love one\u2019s neighbors, to love one\u2019s enemies, to love everything, to love God in all His manifestations. It is possible to love someone dear to you with human love, but an enemy can only be loved by divine love. That is why I experienced such joy when I felt that I loved that man. What has become of him? Is he alive?...\n\n\u201cWhen loving with human love one may pass from love to hatred, but divine love cannot change. No, neither death nor anything else can destroy it. It is the very essence of the soul. Yet how many people have I hated in my life? And of them all, I loved and hated none as I did her.\u201d And he vividly pictured to himself Nat\u00e1sha, not as he had done in the past with nothing but her charms which gave him delight, but for the first time picturing to himself her soul. And he understood her feelings, her sufferings, shame, and remorse. He now understood for the first time all the cruelty of his rejection of her, the cruelty of his rupture with her. \u201cIf only it were possible for me to see her once more! Just once, looking into those eyes to say...\u201d\n\n\u201cPiti-piti-piti and ti-ti and piti-piti-piti boom!\u201d flopped the fly.... And his attention was suddenly carried into another world, a world of reality and delirium in which something particular was happening. In that world some structure was still being erected and did not fall, something was still stretching out, and the candle with its red halo was still burning, and the same shirtlike sphinx lay near the door; but besides all this something creaked, there was a whiff of fresh air, and a new white sphinx appeared, standing at the door. And that sphinx had the pale face and shining eyes of the very Nat\u00e1sha of whom he had just been thinking.\n\n\u201cOh, how oppressive this continual delirium is,\u201d thought Prince Andrew, trying to drive that face from his imagination. But the face remained before him with the force of reality and drew nearer. Prince Andrew wished to return to that former world of pure thought, but he could not, and delirium drew him back into its domain. The soft whispering voice continued its rhythmic murmur, something oppressed him and stretched out, and the strange face was before him. Prince Andrew collected all his strength in an effort to recover his senses, he moved a little, and suddenly there was a ringing in his ears, a dimness in his eyes, and like a man plunged into water he lost consciousness. When he came to himself, Nat\u00e1sha, that same living Nat\u00e1sha whom of all people he most longed to love with this new pure divine love that had been revealed to him, was kneeling before him. He realized that it was the real living Nat\u00e1sha, and he was not surprised but quietly happy. Nat\u00e1sha, motionless on her knees (she was unable to stir), with frightened eyes riveted on him, was restraining her sobs. Her face was pale and rigid. Only in the lower part of it something quivered.\n\nPrince Andrew sighed with relief, smiled, and held out his hand.\n\n\u201cYou?\u201d he said. \u201cHow fortunate!\u201d\n\nWith a rapid but careful movement Nat\u00e1sha drew nearer to him on her knees and, taking his hand carefully, bent her face over it and began kissing it, just touching it lightly with her lips.\n\n\u201cForgive me!\u201d she whispered, raising her head and glancing at him. \u201cForgive me!\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you,\u201d said Prince Andrew.\n\n\u201cForgive...!\u201d\n\n\u201cForgive what?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cForgive me for what I ha-ve do-ne!\u201d faltered Nat\u00e1sha in a scarcely audible, broken whisper, and began kissing his hand more rapidly, just touching it with her lips.\n\n\u201cI love you more, better than before,\u201d said Prince Andrew, lifting her face with his hand so as to look into her eyes.\n\nThose eyes, filled with happy tears, gazed at him timidly, compassionately, and with joyous love. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s thin pale face, with its swollen lips, was more than plain\u2014it was dreadful. But Prince Andrew did not see that, he saw her shining eyes which were beautiful. They heard the sound of voices behind them.\n\nPeter the valet, who was now wide awake, had roused the doctor. Tim\u00f3khin, who had not slept at all because of the pain in his leg, had long been watching all that was going on, carefully covering his bare body with the sheet as he huddled up on his bench.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s this?\u201d said the doctor, rising from his bed. \u201cPlease go away, madam!\u201d\n\nAt that moment a maid sent by the countess, who had noticed her daughter\u2019s absence, knocked at the door.\n\nLike a somnambulist aroused from her sleep Nat\u00e1sha went out of the room and, returning to her hut, fell sobbing on her bed.\n\nFrom that time, during all the rest of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 journey, at every halting place and wherever they spent a night, Nat\u00e1sha never left the wounded Bolk\u00f3nski, and the doctor had to admit that he had not expected from a young girl either such firmness or such skill in nursing a wounded man.\n\nDreadful as the countess imagined it would be should Prince Andrew die in her daughter\u2019s arms during the journey\u2014as, judging by what the doctor said, it seemed might easily happen\u2014she could not oppose Nat\u00e1sha. Though with the intimacy now established between the wounded man and Nat\u00e1sha the thought occurred that should he recover their former engagement would be renewed, no one\u2014least of all Nat\u00e1sha and Prince Andrew\u2014spoke of this: the unsettled question of life and death, which hung not only over Bolk\u00f3nski but over all Russia, shut out all other considerations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIII\n\nOn the third of September Pierre awoke late. His head was aching, the clothes in which he had slept without undressing felt uncomfortable on his body, and his mind had a dim consciousness of something shameful he had done the day before. That something shameful was his yesterday\u2019s conversation with Captain Ramballe.\n\nIt was eleven by the clock, but it seemed peculiarly dark out of doors. Pierre rose, rubbed his eyes, and seeing the pistol with an engraved stock which Ger\u00e1sim had replaced on the writing table, he remembered where he was and what lay before him that very day.\n\n\u201cAm I not too late?\u201d he thought. \u201cNo, probably he won\u2019t make his entry into Moscow before noon.\u201d\n\nPierre did not allow himself to reflect on what lay before him, but hastened to act.\n\nAfter arranging his clothes, he took the pistol and was about to go out. But it then occurred to him for the first time that he certainly could not carry the weapon in his hand through the streets. It was difficult to hide such a big pistol even under his wide coat. He could not carry it unnoticed in his belt or under his arm. Besides, it had been discharged, and he had not had time to reload it. \u201cNo matter, the dagger will do,\u201d he said to himself, though when planning his design he had more than once come to the conclusion that the chief mistake made by the student in 1809 had been to try to kill Napoleon with a dagger. But as his chief aim consisted not in carrying out his design, but in proving to himself that he would not abandon his intention and was doing all he could to achieve it, Pierre hastily took the blunt jagged dagger in a green sheath which he had bought at the S\u00fakharev market with the pistol, and hid it under his waistcoat.\n\nHaving tied a girdle over his coat and pulled his cap low on his head, Pierre went down the corridor, trying to avoid making a noise or meeting the captain, and passed out into the street.\n\nThe conflagration, at which he had looked with so much indifference the evening before, had greatly increased during the night. Moscow was on fire in several places. The buildings in Carriage Row, across the river, in the Bazaar and the Povarsk\u00f3y, as well as the barges on the Moskv\u00e1 River and the timber yards by the Dorogom\u00edlov Bridge, were all ablaze.\n\nPierre\u2019s way led through side streets to the Povarsk\u00f3y and from there to the church of St. Nicholas on the Arb\u00e1t, where he had long before decided that the deed should be done. The gates of most of the houses were locked and the shutters up. The streets and lanes were deserted. The air was full of smoke and the smell of burning. Now and then he met Russians with anxious and timid faces, and Frenchmen with an air not of the city but of the camp, walking in the middle of the streets. Both the Russians and the French looked at Pierre with surprise. Besides his height and stoutness, and the strange morose look of suffering in his face and whole figure, the Russians stared at Pierre because they could not make out to what class he could belong. The French followed him with astonishment in their eyes chiefly because Pierre, unlike all the other Russians who gazed at the French with fear and curiosity, paid no attention to them. At the gate of one house three Frenchmen, who were explaining something to some Russians who did not understand them, stopped Pierre asking if he did not know French.\n\nPierre shook his head and went on. In another side street a sentinel standing beside a green caisson shouted at him, but only when the shout was threateningly repeated and he heard the click of the man\u2019s musket as he raised it did Pierre understand that he had to pass on the other side of the street. He heard nothing and saw nothing of what went on around him. He carried his resolution within himself in terror and haste, like something dreadful and alien to him, for, after the previous night\u2019s experience, he was afraid of losing it. But he was not destined to bring his mood safely to his destination. And even had he not been hindered by anything on the way, his intention could not now have been carried out, for Napoleon had passed the Arb\u00e1t more than four hours previously on his way from the Dorogom\u00edlov suburb to the Kr\u00e9mlin, and was now sitting in a very gloomy frame of mind in a royal study in the Kr\u00e9mlin, giving detailed and exact orders as to measures to be taken immediately to extinguish the fire, to prevent looting, and to reassure the inhabitants. But Pierre did not know this; he was entirely absorbed in what lay before him, and was tortured\u2014as those are who obstinately undertake a task that is impossible for them not because of its difficulty but because of its incompatibility with their natures\u2014by the fear of weakening at the decisive moment and so losing his self-esteem.\n\nThough he heard and saw nothing around him he found his way by instinct and did not go wrong in the side streets that led to the Povarsk\u00f3y.\n\nAs Pierre approached that street the smoke became denser and denser\u2014he even felt the heat of the fire. Occasionally curly tongues of flame rose from under the roofs of the houses. He met more people in the streets and they were more excited. But Pierre, though he felt that something unusual was happening around him, did not realize that he was approaching the fire. As he was going along a footpath across a wide-open space adjoining the Povarsk\u00f3y on one side and the gardens of Prince Gruz\u00ednski\u2019s house on the other, Pierre suddenly heard the desperate weeping of a woman close to him. He stopped as if awakening from a dream and lifted his head.\n\nBy the side of the path, on the dusty dry grass, all sorts of household goods lay in a heap: featherbeds, a samovar, icons, and trunks. On the ground, beside the trunks, sat a thin woman no longer young, with long, prominent upper teeth, and wearing a black cloak and cap. This woman, swaying to and fro and muttering something, was choking with sobs. Two girls of about ten and twelve, dressed in dirty short frocks and cloaks, were staring at their mother with a look of stupefaction on their pale frightened faces. The youngest child, a boy of about seven, who wore an overcoat and an immense cap evidently not his own, was crying in his old nurse\u2019s arms. A dirty, barefooted maid was sitting on a trunk, and, having undone her pale-colored plait, was pulling it straight and sniffing at her singed hair. The woman\u2019s husband, a short, round-shouldered man in the undress uniform of a civilian official, with sausage-shaped whiskers and showing under his square-set cap the hair smoothly brushed forward over his temples, with expressionless face was moving the trunks, which were placed one on another, and was dragging some garments from under them.\n\nAs soon as she saw Pierre, the woman almost threw herself at his feet.\n\n\u201cDear people, good Christians, save me, help me, dear friends... help us, somebody,\u201d she muttered between her sobs. \u201cMy girl... My daughter! My youngest daughter is left behind. She\u2019s burned! Ooh! Was it for this I nursed you.... Ooh!\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t, Mary Nikol\u00e1evna!\u201d said her husband to her in a low voice, evidently only to justify himself before the stranger. \u201cSister must have taken her, or else where can she be?\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cMonster! Villain!\u201d shouted the woman angrily, suddenly ceasing to weep. \u201cYou have no heart, you don\u2019t feel for your own child! Another man would have rescued her from the fire. But this is a monster and neither a man nor a father! You, honored sir, are a noble man,\u201d she went on, addressing Pierre rapidly between her sobs. \u201cThe fire broke out alongside, and blew our way, the maid called out \u2018Fire!\u2019 and we rushed to collect our things. We ran out just as we were.... This is what we have brought away.... The icons, and my dowry bed, all the rest is lost. We seized the children. But not Katie! Ooh! O Lord!...\u201d and again she began to sob. \u201cMy child, my dear one! Burned, burned!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut where was she left?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\nFrom the expression of his animated face the woman saw that this man might help her.\n\n\u201cOh, dear sir!\u201d she cried, seizing him by the legs. \u201cMy benefactor, set my heart at ease.... An\u00edska, go, you horrid girl, show him the way!\u201d she cried to the maid, angrily opening her mouth and still farther exposing her long teeth.\n\n\u201cShow me the way, show me, I... I\u2019ll do it,\u201d gasped Pierre rapidly.\n\nThe dirty maidservant stepped from behind the trunk, put up her plait, sighed, and went on her short, bare feet along the path. Pierre felt as if he had come back to life after a heavy swoon. He held his head higher, his eyes shone with the light of life, and with swift steps he followed the maid, overtook her, and came out on the Povarsk\u00f3y. The whole street was full of clouds of black smoke. Tongues of flame here and there broke through that cloud. A great number of people crowded in front of the conflagration. In the middle of the street stood a French general saying something to those around him. Pierre, accompanied by the maid, was advancing to the spot where the general stood, but the French soldiers stopped him.\n\n\u201cOn ne passe pas!\u201d cried a voice.\n\n\u201cThis way, uncle,\u201d cried the girl. \u201cWe\u2019ll pass through the side street, by the Nik\u00falins\u2019!\u201d\n\nPierre turned back, giving a spring now and then to keep up with her. She ran across the street, turned down a side street to the left, and, passing three houses, turned into a yard on the right.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s here, close by,\u201d said she and, running across the yard, opened a gate in a wooden fence and, stopping, pointed out to him a small wooden wing of the house, which was burning brightly and fiercely. One of its sides had fallen in, another was on fire, and bright flames issued from the openings of the windows and from under the roof.\n\nAs Pierre passed through the fence gate, he was enveloped by hot air and involuntarily stopped.\n\n\u201cWhich is it? Which is your house?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cOoh!\u201d wailed the girl, pointing to the wing. \u201cThat\u2019s it, that was our lodging. You\u2019ve burned to death, our treasure, Katie, my precious little missy! Ooh!\u201d lamented An\u00edska, who at the sight of the fire felt that she too must give expression to her feelings.\n\nPierre rushed to the wing, but the heat was so great that he involuntarily passed round in a curve and came upon the large house that was as yet burning only at one end, just below the roof, and around which swarmed a crowd of Frenchmen. At first Pierre did not realize what these men, who were dragging something out, were about; but seeing before him a Frenchman hitting a peasant with a blunt saber and trying to take from him a fox-fur coat, he vaguely understood that looting was going on there, but he had no time to dwell on that idea.\n\nThe sounds of crackling and the din of falling walls and ceilings, the whistle and hiss of the flames, the excited shouts of the people, and the sight of the swaying smoke, now gathering into thick black clouds and now soaring up with glittering sparks, with here and there dense sheaves of flame (now red and now like golden fish scales creeping along the walls), and the heat and smoke and rapidity of motion, produced on Pierre the usual animating effects of a conflagration. It had a peculiarly strong effect on him because at the sight of the fire he felt himself suddenly freed from the ideas that had weighed him down. He felt young, bright, adroit, and resolute. He ran round to the other side of the lodge and was about to dash into that part of it which was still standing, when just above his head he heard several voices shouting and then a cracking sound and the ring of something heavy falling close beside him.\n\nPierre looked up and saw at a window of the large house some Frenchmen who had just thrown out the drawer of a chest, filled with metal articles. Other French soldiers standing below went up to the drawer.\n\n\u201cWhat does this fellow want?\u201d shouted one of them referring to Pierre.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a child in that house. Haven\u2019t you seen a child?\u201d cried Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s he talking about? Get along!\u201d said several voices, and one of the soldiers, evidently afraid that Pierre might want to take from them some of the plate and bronzes that were in the drawer, moved threateningly toward him.\n\n\u201cA child?\u201d shouted a Frenchman from above. \u201cI did hear something squealing in the garden. Perhaps it\u2019s his brat that the fellow is looking for. After all, one must be human, you know....\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere is it? Where?\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cThere! There!\u201d shouted the Frenchman at the window, pointing to the garden at the back of the house. \u201cWait a bit\u2014I\u2019m coming down.\u201d\n\nAnd a minute or two later the Frenchman, a black-eyed fellow with a spot on his cheek, in shirt sleeves, really did jump out of a window on the ground floor, and clapping Pierre on the shoulder ran with him into the garden.\n\n\u201cHurry up, you others!\u201d he called out to his comrades. \u201cIt\u2019s getting hot.\u201d\n\nWhen they reached a gravel path behind the house the Frenchman pulled Pierre by the arm and pointed to a round, graveled space where a three-year-old girl in a pink dress was lying under a seat.\n\n\u201cThere is your child! Oh, a girl, so much the better!\u201d said the Frenchman. \u201cGood-by, Fatty. We must be human, we are all mortal you know!\u201d and the Frenchman with the spot on his cheek ran back to his comrades.\n\nBreathless with joy, Pierre ran to the little girl and was going to take her in his arms. But seeing a stranger the sickly, scrofulous-looking child, unattractively like her mother, began to yell and run away. Pierre, however, seized her and lifted her in his arms. She screamed desperately and angrily and tried with her little hands to pull Pierre\u2019s hands away and to bite them with her slobbering mouth. Pierre was seized by a sense of horror and repulsion such as he had experienced when touching some nasty little animal. But he made an effort not to throw the child down and ran with her to the large house. It was now, however, impossible to get back the way he had come; the maid, An\u00edska, was no longer there, and Pierre with a feeling of pity and disgust pressed the wet, painfully sobbing child to himself as tenderly as he could and ran with her through the garden seeking another way out.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XXXIV\n\nHaving run through different yards and side streets, Pierre got back with his little burden to the Gruz\u00ednski garden at the corner of the Povarsk\u00f3y. He did not at first recognize the place from which he had set out to look for the child, so crowded was it now with people and goods that had been dragged out of the houses. Besides Russian families who had taken refuge here from the fire with their belongings, there were several French soldiers in a variety of clothing. Pierre took no notice of them. He hurried to find the family of that civil servant in order to restore the daughter to her mother and go to save someone else. Pierre felt that he had still much to do and to do quickly. Glowing with the heat and from running, he felt at that moment more strongly than ever the sense of youth, animation, and determination that had come on him when he ran to save the child. She had now become quiet and, clinging with her little hands to Pierre\u2019s coat, sat on his arm gazing about her like some little wild animal. He glanced at her occasionally with a slight smile. He fancied he saw something pathetically innocent in that frightened, sickly little face.\n\nHe did not find the civil servant or his wife where he had left them. He walked among the crowd with rapid steps, scanning the various faces he met. Involuntarily he noticed a Georgian or Armenian family consisting of a very handsome old man of Oriental type, wearing a new, cloth-covered, sheepskin coat and new boots, an old woman of similar type, and a young woman. That very young woman seemed to Pierre the perfection of Oriental beauty, with her sharply outlined, arched, black eyebrows and the extraordinarily soft, bright color of her long, beautiful, expressionless face. Amid the scattered property and the crowd on the open space, she, in her rich satin cloak with a bright lilac shawl on her head, suggested a delicate exotic plant thrown out onto the snow. She was sitting on some bundles a little behind the old woman, and looked from under her long lashes with motionless, large, almond-shaped eyes at the ground before her. Evidently she was aware of her beauty and fearful because of it. Her face struck Pierre and, hurrying along by the fence, he turned several times to look at her. When he had reached the fence, still without finding those he sought, he stopped and looked about him.\n\nWith the child in his arms his figure was now more conspicuous than before, and a group of Russians, both men and women, gathered about him.\n\n\u201cHave you lost anyone, my dear fellow? You\u2019re of the gentry yourself, aren\u2019t you? Whose child is it?\u201d they asked him.\n\nPierre replied that the child belonged to a woman in a black coat who had been sitting there with her other children, and he asked whether anyone knew where she had gone.\n\n\u201cWhy, that must be the Anf\u00e9rovs,\u201d said an old deacon, addressing a pockmarked peasant woman. \u201cLord have mercy, Lord have mercy!\u201d he added in his customary bass.\n\n\u201cThe Anf\u00e9rovs? No,\u201d said the woman. \u201cThey left in the morning. That must be either Mary Nikol\u00e1evna\u2019s or the Iv\u00e1novs\u2019!\u201d\n\n\u201cHe says \u2018a woman,\u2019 and Mary Nikol\u00e1evna is a lady,\u201d remarked a house serf.\n\n\u201cDo you know her? She\u2019s thin, with long teeth,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Mary Nikol\u00e1evna! They went inside the garden when these wolves swooped down,\u201d said the woman, pointing to the French soldiers.\n\n\u201cO Lord, have mercy!\u201d added the deacon.\n\n\u201cGo over that way, they\u2019re there. It\u2019s she! She kept on lamenting and crying,\u201d continued the woman. \u201cIt\u2019s she. Here, this way!\u201d\n\nBut Pierre was not listening to the woman. He had for some seconds been intently watching what was going on a few steps away. He was looking at the Armenian family and at two French soldiers who had gone up to them. One of these, a nimble little man, was wearing a blue coat tied round the waist with a rope. He had a nightcap on his head and his feet were bare. The other, whose appearance particularly struck Pierre, was a long, lank, round-shouldered, fair-haired man, slow in his movements and with an idiotic expression of face. He wore a woman\u2019s loose gown of frieze, blue trousers, and large torn Hessian boots. The little barefooted Frenchman in the blue coat went up to the Armenians and, saying something, immediately seized the old man by his legs and the old man at once began pulling off his boots. The other in the frieze gown stopped in front of the beautiful Armenian girl and with his hands in his pockets stood staring at her, motionless and silent.\n\n\u201cHere, take the child!\u201d said Pierre peremptorily and hurriedly to the woman, handing the little girl to her. \u201cGive her back to them, give her back!\u201d he almost shouted, putting the child, who began screaming, on the ground, and again looking at the Frenchman and the Armenian family.\n\nThe old man was already sitting barefoot. The little Frenchman had secured his second boot and was slapping one boot against the other. The old man was saying something in a voice broken by sobs, but Pierre caught but a glimpse of this, his whole attention was directed to the Frenchman in the frieze gown who meanwhile, swaying slowly from side to side, had drawn nearer to the young woman and taking his hands from his pockets had seized her by the neck.\n\nThe beautiful Armenian still sat motionless and in the same attitude, with her long lashes drooping as if she did not see or feel what the soldier was doing to her.\n\nWhile Pierre was running the few steps that separated him from the Frenchman, the tall marauder in the frieze gown was already tearing from her neck the necklace the young Armenian was wearing, and the young woman, clutching at her neck, screamed piercingly.\n\n\u201cLet that woman alone!\u201d exclaimed Pierre hoarsely in a furious voice, seizing the soldier by his round shoulders and throwing him aside.\n\nThe soldier fell, got up, and ran away. But his comrade, throwing down the boots and drawing his sword, moved threateningly toward Pierre.\n\n\u201cVoyons, pas de b\u00eatises!\u201d he cried.\n\nPierre was in such a transport of rage that he remembered nothing and his strength increased tenfold. He rushed at the barefooted Frenchman and, before the latter had time to draw his sword, knocked him off his feet and hammered him with his fists. Shouts of approval were heard from the crowd around, and at the same moment a mounted patrol of French Uhlans appeared from round the corner. The Uhlans came up at a trot to Pierre and the Frenchman and surrounded them. Pierre remembered nothing of what happened after that. He only remembered beating someone and being beaten and finally feeling that his hands were bound and that a crowd of French soldiers stood around him and were searching him.\n\n\u201cLieutenant, he has a dagger,\u201d were the first words Pierre understood.\n\n\u201cAh, a weapon?\u201d said the officer and turned to the barefooted soldier who had been arrested with Pierre. \u201cAll right, you can tell all about it at the court-martial.\u201d Then he turned to Pierre. \u201cDo you speak French?\u201d\n\nPierre looked around him with bloodshot eyes and did not reply. His face probably looked very terrible, for the officer said something in a whisper and four more Uhlans left the ranks and placed themselves on both sides of Pierre.\n\n\u201cDo you speak French?\u201d the officer asked again, keeping at a distance from Pierre. \u201cCall the interpreter.\u201d\n\nA little man in Russian civilian clothes rode out from the ranks, and by his clothes and manner of speaking Pierre at once knew him to be a French salesman from one of the Moscow shops.\n\n\u201cHe does not look like a common man,\u201d said the interpreter, after a searching look at Pierre.\n\n\u201cAh, he looks very much like an incendiary,\u201d remarked the officer. \u201cAnd ask him who he is,\u201d he added.\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d asked the interpreter in poor Russian. \u201cYou must answer the chief.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will not tell you who I am. I am your prisoner\u2014take me!\u201d Pierre suddenly replied in French.\n\n\u201cAh, ah!\u201d muttered the officer with a frown. \u201cWell then, march!\u201d\n\nA crowd had collected round the Uhlans. Nearest to Pierre stood the pockmarked peasant woman with the little girl, and when the patrol started she moved forward.\n\n\u201cWhere are they taking you to, you poor dear?\u201d said she. \u201cAnd the little girl, the little girl, what am I to do with her if she\u2019s not theirs?\u201d said the woman.\n\n\u201cWhat does that woman want?\u201d asked the officer.\n\nPierre was as if intoxicated. His elation increased at the sight of the little girl he had saved.\n\n\u201cWhat does she want?\u201d he murmured. \u201cShe is bringing me my daughter whom I have just saved from the flames,\u201d said he. \u201cGood-by!\u201d And without knowing how this aimless lie had escaped him, he went along with resolute and triumphant steps between the French soldiers.\n\nThe French patrol was one of those sent out through the various streets of Moscow by Durosnel\u2019s order to put a stop to the pillage, and especially to catch the incendiaries who, according to the general opinion which had that day originated among the higher French officers, were the cause of the conflagrations. After marching through a number of streets the patrol arrested five more Russian suspects: a small shopkeeper, two seminary students, a peasant, and a house serf, besides several looters. But of all these various suspected characters, Pierre was considered to be the most suspicious of all. When they had all been brought for the night to a large house on the Z\u00fabov Rampart that was being used as a guardhouse, Pierre was placed apart under strict guard.\n\n\n\nBOOK TWELVE: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nIn Petersburg at that time a complicated struggle was being carried on with greater heat than ever in the highest circles, between the parties of Rumy\u00e1ntsev, the French, M\u00e1rya F\u00ebdorovna, the Tsar\u00e9vich, and others, drowned as usual by the buzzing of the court drones. But the calm, luxurious life of Petersburg, concerned only about phantoms and reflections of real life, went on in its old way and made it hard, except by a great effort, to realize the danger and the difficult position of the Russian people. There were the same receptions and balls, the same French theater, the same court interests and service interests and intrigues as usual. Only in the very highest circles were attempts made to keep in mind the difficulties of the actual position. Stories were whispered of how differently the two Empresses behaved in these difficult circumstances. The Empress M\u00e1rya, concerned for the welfare of the charitable and educational institutions under her patronage, had given directions that they should all be removed to Kaz\u00e1n, and the things belonging to these institutions had already been packed up. The Empress Elisabeth, however, when asked what instructions she would be pleased to give\u2014with her characteristic Russian patriotism had replied that she could give no directions about state institutions for that was the affair of the sovereign, but as far as she personally was concerned she would be the last to quit Petersburg.\n\nAt Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s on the twenty-sixth of August, the very day of the battle of Borodin\u00f3, there was a soiree, the chief feature of which was to be the reading of a letter from His Lordship the Bishop when sending the Emperor an icon of the Venerable Sergius. It was regarded as a model of ecclesiastical, patriotic eloquence. Prince Vas\u00edli himself, famed for his elocution, was to read it. (He used to read at the Empress\u2019.) The art of his reading was supposed to lie in rolling out the words, quite independently of their meaning, in a loud and singsong voice alternating between a despairing wail and a tender murmur, so that the wail fell quite at random on one word and the murmur on another. This reading, as was always the case at Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s soirees, had a political significance. That evening she expected several important personages who had to be made ashamed of their visits to the French theater and aroused to a patriotic temper. A good many people had already arrived, but Anna P\u00e1vlovna, not yet seeing all those whom she wanted in her drawing room, did not let the reading begin but wound up the springs of a general conversation.\n\nThe news of the day in Petersburg was the illness of Countess Bez\u00fakhova. She had fallen ill unexpectedly a few days previously, had missed several gatherings of which she was usually the ornament, and was said to be receiving no one, and instead of the celebrated Petersburg doctors who usually attended her had entrusted herself to some Italian doctor who was treating her in some new and unusual way.\n\nThey all knew very well that the enchanting countess\u2019 illness arose from an inconvenience resulting from marrying two husbands at the same time, and that the Italian\u2019s cure consisted in removing such inconvenience; but in Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s presence no one dared to think of this or even appear to know it.\n\n\u201cThey say the poor countess is very ill. The doctor says it is angina pectoris.\u201d\n\n\u201cAngina? Oh, that\u2019s a terrible illness!\u201d\n\n\u201cThey say that the rivals are reconciled, thanks to the angina...\u201d and the word angina was repeated with great satisfaction.\n\n\u201cThe count is pathetic, they say. He cried like a child when the doctor told him the case was dangerous.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, it would be a terrible loss, she is an enchanting woman.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are speaking of the poor countess?\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, coming up just then. \u201cI sent to ask for news, and hear that she is a little better. Oh, she is certainly the most charming woman in the world,\u201d she went on, with a smile at her own enthusiasm. \u201cWe belong to different camps, but that does not prevent my esteeming her as she deserves. She is very unfortunate!\u201d added Anna P\u00e1vlovna.\n\nSupposing that by these words Anna P\u00e1vlovna was somewhat lifting the veil from the secret of the countess\u2019 malady, an unwary young man ventured to express surprise that well-known doctors had not been called in and that the countess was being attended by a charlatan who might employ dangerous remedies.\n\n\u201cYour information may be better than mine,\u201d Anna P\u00e1vlovna suddenly and venomously retorted on the inexperienced young man, \u201cbut I know on good authority that this doctor is a very learned and able man. He is private physician to the Queen of Spain.\u201d\n\nAnd having thus demolished the young man, Anna P\u00e1vlovna turned to another group where Bil\u00edbin was talking about the Austrians: having wrinkled up his face he was evidently preparing to smooth it out again and utter one of his mots.\n\n\u201cI think it is delightful,\u201d he said, referring to a diplomatic note that had been sent to Vienna with some Austrian banners captured from the French by Wittgenstein, \u201cthe hero of Petropol\u201d as he was then called in Petersburg.\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s that?\u201d asked Anna P\u00e1vlovna, securing silence for the mot, which she had heard before.\n\nAnd Bil\u00edbin repeated the actual words of the diplomatic dispatch, which he had himself composed.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor returns these Austrian banners,\u201d said Bil\u00edbin, \u201cfriendly banners gone astray and found on a wrong path,\u201d and his brow became smooth again.\n\n\u201cCharming, charming!\u201d observed Prince Vas\u00edli.\n\n\u201cThe path to Warsaw, perhaps,\u201d Prince Hippolyte remarked loudly and unexpectedly. Everybody looked at him, understanding what he meant. Prince Hippolyte himself glanced around with amused surprise. He knew no more than the others what his words meant. During his diplomatic career he had more than once noticed that such utterances were received as very witty, and at every opportunity he uttered in that way the first words that entered his head. \u201cIt may turn out very well,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut if not, they\u2019ll know how to arrange matters.\u201d And really, during the awkward silence that ensued, that insufficiently patriotic person entered whom Anna P\u00e1vlovna had been waiting for and wished to convert, and she, smiling and shaking a finger at Hippolyte, invited Prince Vas\u00edli to the table and bringing him two candles and the manuscript begged him to begin. Everyone became silent.\n\n\u201cMost Gracious Sovereign and Emperor!\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli sternly declaimed, looking round at his audience as if to inquire whether anyone had anything to say to the contrary. But no one said anything. \u201cMoscow, our ancient capital, the New Jerusalem, receives her Christ\u201d\u2014he placed a sudden emphasis on the word her\u2014\u201cas a mother receives her zealous sons into her arms, and through the gathering mists, foreseeing the brilliant glory of thy rule, sings in exultation, \u2018Hosanna, blessed is he that cometh!\u2019\u201d\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli pronounced these last words in a tearful voice.\n\nBil\u00edbin attentively examined his nails, and many of those present appeared intimidated, as if asking in what they were to blame. Anna P\u00e1vlovna whispered the next words in advance, like an old woman muttering the prayer at Communion: \u201cLet the bold and insolent Goliath...\u201d she whispered.\n\nPrince Vas\u00edli continued.\n\n\u201cLet the bold and insolent Goliath from the borders of France encompass the realms of Russia with death-bearing terrors; humble Faith, the sling of the Russian David, shall suddenly smite his head in his bloodthirsty pride. This icon of the Venerable Sergius, the servant of God and zealous champion of old of our country\u2019s weal, is offered to Your Imperial Majesty. I grieve that my waning strength prevents rejoicing in the sight of your most gracious presence. I raise fervent prayers to Heaven that the Almighty may exalt the race of the just, and mercifully fulfill the desires of Your Majesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat force! What a style!\u201d was uttered in approval both of reader and of author.\n\nAnimated by that address Anna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s guests talked for a long time of the state of the fatherland and offered various conjectures as to the result of the battle to be fought in a few days.\n\n\u201cYou will see,\u201d said Anna P\u00e1vlovna, \u201cthat tomorrow, on the Emperor\u2019s birthday, we shall receive news. I have a favorable presentiment!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s presentiment was in fact fulfilled. Next day during the service at the palace church in honor of the Emperor\u2019s birthday, Prince Volk\u00f3nski was called out of the church and received a dispatch from Prince Kut\u00fazov. It was Kut\u00fazov\u2019s report, written from Tat\u00e1rinova on the day of the battle. Kut\u00fazov wrote that the Russians had not retreated a step, that the French losses were much heavier than ours, and that he was writing in haste from the field of battle before collecting full information. It followed that there must have been a victory. And at once, without leaving the church, thanks were rendered to the Creator for His help and for the victory.\n\nAnna P\u00e1vlovna\u2019s presentiment was justified, and all that morning a joyously festive mood reigned in the city. Everyone believed the victory to have been complete, and some even spoke of Napoleon\u2019s having been captured, of his deposition, and of the choice of a new ruler for France.\n\nIt is very difficult for events to be reflected in their real strength and completeness amid the conditions of court life and far from the scene of action. General events involuntarily group themselves around some particular incident. So now the courtiers\u2019 pleasure was based as much on the fact that the news had arrived on the Emperor\u2019s birthday as on the fact of the victory itself. It was like a successfully arranged surprise. Mention was made in Kut\u00fazov\u2019s report of the Russian losses, among which figured the names of T\u00fachkov, Bagrati\u00f3n, and Kut\u00e1ysov. In the Petersburg world this sad side of the affair again involuntarily centered round a single incident: Kut\u00e1ysov\u2019s death. Everybody knew him, the Emperor liked him, and he was young and interesting. That day everyone met with the words:\n\n\u201cWhat a wonderful coincidence! Just during the service. But what a loss Kut\u00e1ysov is! How sorry I am!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat did I tell about Kut\u00fazov?\u201d Prince Vas\u00edli now said with a prophet\u2019s pride. \u201cI always said he was the only man capable of defeating Napoleon.\u201d\n\nBut next day no news arrived from the army and the public mood grew anxious. The courtiers suffered because of the suffering the suspense occasioned the Emperor.\n\n\u201cFancy the Emperor\u2019s position!\u201d said they, and instead of extolling Kut\u00fazov as they had done the day before, they condemned him as the cause of the Emperor\u2019s anxiety. That day Prince Vas\u00edli no longer boasted of his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Kut\u00fazov, but remained silent when the commander in chief was mentioned. Moreover, toward evening, as if everything conspired to make Petersburg society anxious and uneasy, a terrible piece of news was added. Countess H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Bez\u00fakhova had suddenly died of that terrible malady it had been so agreeable to mention. Officially, at large gatherings, everyone said that Countess Bez\u00fakhova had died of a terrible attack of angina pectoris, but in intimate circles details were mentioned of how the private physician of the Queen of Spain had prescribed small doses of a certain drug to produce a certain effect; but H\u00e9l\u00e8ne, tortured by the fact that the old count suspected her and that her husband to whom she had written (that wretched, profligate Pierre) had not replied, had suddenly taken a very large dose of the drug, and had died in agony before assistance could be rendered her. It was said that Prince Vas\u00edli and the old count had turned upon the Italian, but the latter had produced such letters from the unfortunate deceased that they had immediately let the matter drop.\n\nTalk in general centered round three melancholy facts: the Emperor\u2019s lack of news, the loss of Kut\u00e1ysov, and the death of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nOn the third day after Kut\u00fazov\u2019s report a country gentleman arrived from Moscow, and news of the surrender of Moscow to the French spread through the whole town. This was terrible! What a position for the Emperor to be in! Kut\u00fazov was a traitor, and Prince Vas\u00edli during the visits of condolence paid to him on the occasion of his daughter\u2019s death said of Kut\u00fazov, whom he had formerly praised (it was excusable for him in his grief to forget what he had said), that it was impossible to expect anything else from a blind and depraved old man.\n\n\u201cI only wonder that the fate of Russia could have been entrusted to such a man.\u201d\n\nAs long as this news remained unofficial it was possible to doubt it, but the next day the following communication was received from Count Rostopch\u00edn:\n\nPrince Kut\u00fazov\u2019s adjutant has brought me a letter in which he demands police officers to guide the army to the Ryaz\u00e1n road. He writes that he is regretfully abandoning Moscow. Sire! Kut\u00fazov\u2019s action decides the fate of the capital and of your empire! Russia will shudder to learn of the abandonment of the city in which her greatness is centered and in which lie the ashes of your ancestors! I shall follow the army. I have had everything removed, and it only remains for me to weep over the fate of my fatherland.\n\nOn receiving this dispatch the Emperor sent Prince Volk\u00f3nski to Kut\u00fazov with the following rescript:\n\nPrince Michael Ilari\u00f3novich! Since the twenty-ninth of August I have received no communication from you, yet on the first of September I received from the commander in chief of Moscow, via Yarosl\u00e1vl, the sad news that you, with the army, have decided to abandon Moscow. You can yourself imagine the effect this news has had on me, and your silence increases my astonishment. I am sending this by Adjutant-General Prince Volk\u00f3nski, to hear from you the situation of the army and the reasons that have induced you to take this melancholy decision.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nNine days after the abandonment of Moscow, a messenger from Kut\u00fazov reached Petersburg with the official announcement of that event. This messenger was Michaud, a Frenchman who did not know Russian, but who was quoique \u00e9tranger, russe de c\u0153ur et d\u2019\u00e2me, as he said of himself.\n\nThe Emperor at once received this messenger in his study at the palace on Stone Island. Michaud, who had never seen Moscow before the campaign and who did not know Russian, yet felt deeply moved (as he wrote) when he appeared before notre tr\u00e8s gracieux souverain with the news of the burning of Moscow, dont les flammes \u00e9clairaient sa route.\n\nThough the source of M. Michaud\u2019s chagrin must have been different from that which caused Russians to grieve, he had such a sad face when shown into the Emperor\u2019s study that the latter at once asked:\n\n\u201cHave you brought me sad news, Colonel?\u201d\n\n\u201cVery sad, sire,\u201d replied Michaud, lowering his eyes with a sigh. \u201cThe abandonment of Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cHave they surrendered my ancient capital without a battle?\u201d asked the Emperor quickly, his face suddenly flushing.\n\nMichaud respectfully delivered the message Kut\u00fazov had entrusted to him, which was that it had been impossible to fight before Moscow, and that as the only remaining choice was between losing the army as well as Moscow, or losing Moscow alone, the field marshal had to choose the latter.\n\nThe Emperor listened in silence, not looking at Michaud.\n\n\u201cHas the enemy entered the city?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cYes, sire, and Moscow is now in ashes. I left it all in flames,\u201d replied Michaud in a decided tone, but glancing at the Emperor he was frightened by what he had done.\n\nThe Emperor began to breathe heavily and rapidly, his lower lip trembled, and tears instantly appeared in his fine blue eyes.\n\nBut this lasted only a moment. He suddenly frowned, as if blaming himself for his weakness, and raising his head addressed Michaud in a firm voice:\n\n\u201cI see, Colonel, from all that is happening, that Providence requires great sacrifices of us... I am ready to submit myself in all things to His will; but tell me, Michaud, how did you leave the army when it saw my ancient capital abandoned without a battle? Did you not notice discouragement?...\u201d\n\nSeeing that his most gracious ruler was calm once more, Michaud also grew calm, but was not immediately ready to reply to the Emperor\u2019s direct and relevant question which required a direct answer.\n\n\u201cSire, will you allow me to speak frankly as befits a loyal soldier?\u201d he asked to gain time.\n\n\u201cColonel, I always require it,\u201d replied the Emperor. \u201cConceal nothing from me, I wish to know absolutely how things are.\u201d\n\n\u201cSire!\u201d said Michaud with a subtle, scarcely perceptible smile on his lips, having now prepared a well-phrased reply, \u201csire, I left the whole army, from its chiefs to the lowest soldier, without exception in desperate and agonized terror...\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is that?\u201d the Emperor interrupted him, frowning sternly. \u201cWould misfortune make my Russians lose heart?... Never!\u201d\n\nMichaud had only waited for this to bring out the phrase he had prepared.\n\n\u201cSire,\u201d he said, with respectful playfulness, \u201cthey are only afraid lest Your Majesty, in the goodness of your heart, should allow yourself to be persuaded to make peace. They are burning for the combat,\u201d declared this representative of the Russian nation, \u201cand to prove to Your Majesty by the sacrifice of their lives how devoted they are....\u201d\n\n\u201cAh!\u201d said the Emperor reassured, and with a kindly gleam in his eyes, he patted Michaud on the shoulder. \u201cYou set me at ease, Colonel.\u201d\n\nHe bent his head and was silent for some time.\n\n\u201cWell, then, go back to the army,\u201d he said, drawing himself up to his full height and addressing Michaud with a gracious and majestic gesture, \u201cand tell our brave men and all my good subjects wherever you go that when I have not a soldier left I shall put myself at the head of my beloved nobility and my good peasants and so use the last resources of my empire. It still offers me more than my enemies suppose,\u201d said the Emperor growing more and more animated; \u201cbut should it ever be ordained by Divine Providence,\u201d he continued, raising to heaven his fine eyes shining with emotion, \u201cthat my dynasty should cease to reign on the throne of my ancestors, then after exhausting all the means at my command, I shall let my beard grow to here\u201d (he pointed halfway down his chest) \u201cand go and eat potatoes with the meanest of my peasants, rather than sign the disgrace of my country and of my beloved people whose sacrifices I know how to appreciate.\u201d\n\nHaving uttered these words in an agitated voice the Emperor suddenly turned away as if to hide from Michaud the tears that rose to his eyes, and went to the further end of his study. Having stood there a few moments, he strode back to Michaud and pressed his arm below the elbow with a vigorous movement. The Emperor\u2019s mild and handsome face was flushed and his eyes gleamed with resolution and anger.\n\n\u201cColonel Michaud, do not forget what I say to you here, perhaps we may recall it with pleasure someday... Napoleon or I,\u201d said the Emperor, touching his breast. \u201cWe can no longer both reign together. I have learned to know him, and he will not deceive me any more....\u201d\n\nAnd the Emperor paused, with a frown.\n\nWhen he heard these words and saw the expression of firm resolution in the Emperor\u2019s eyes, Michaud\u2014quoique \u00e9tranger, russe de c\u0153ur et d\u2019\u00e2me,\u2014at that solemn moment felt himself enraptured by all that he had heard (as he used afterwards to say), and gave expression to his own feelings and those of the Russian people whose representative he considered himself to be, in the following words:\n\n\u201cSire!\u201d said he, \u201cYour Majesty is at this moment signing the glory of the nation and the salvation of Europe!\u201d\n\nWith an inclination of the head the Emperor dismissed him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt is natural for us who were not living in those days to imagine that when half Russia had been conquered and the inhabitants were fleeing to distant provinces, and one levy after another was being raised for the defense of the fatherland, all Russians from the greatest to the least were solely engaged in sacrificing themselves, saving their fatherland, or weeping over its downfall. The tales and descriptions of that time without exception speak only of the self-sacrifice, patriotic devotion, despair, grief, and the heroism of the Russians. But it was not really so. It appears so to us because we see only the general historic interest of that time and do not see all the personal human interests that people had. Yet in reality those personal interests of the moment so much transcend the general interests that they always prevent the public interest from being felt or even noticed. Most of the people at that time paid no attention to the general progress of events but were guided only by their private interests, and they were the very people whose activities at that period were most useful.\n\nThose who tried to understand the general course of events and to take part in it by self-sacrifice and heroism were the most useless members of society, they saw everything upside down, and all they did for the common good turned out to be useless and foolish\u2014like Pierre\u2019s and Mam\u00f3nov\u2019s regiments which looted Russian villages, and the lint the young ladies prepared and that never reached the wounded, and so on. Even those, fond of intellectual talk and of expressing their feelings, who discussed Russia\u2019s position at the time involuntarily introduced into their conversation either a shade of pretense and falsehood or useless condemnation and anger directed against people accused of actions no one could possibly be guilty of. In historic events the rule forbidding us to eat of the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge is specially applicable. Only unconscious action bears fruit, and he who plays a part in an historic event never understands its significance. If he tries to realize it his efforts are fruitless.\n\nThe more closely a man was engaged in the events then taking place in Russia the less did he realize their significance. In Petersburg and in the provinces at a distance from Moscow, ladies, and gentlemen in militia uniforms, wept for Russia and its ancient capital and talked of self-sacrifice and so on; but in the army which retired beyond Moscow there was little talk or thought of Moscow, and when they caught sight of its burned ruins no one swore to be avenged on the French, but they thought about their next pay, their next quarters, of Matr\u00ebshka the vivandi\u00e8re, and like matters.\n\nAs the war had caught him in the service, Nicholas Rost\u00f3v took a close and prolonged part in the defense of his country, but did so casually, without any aim at self-sacrifice, and he therefore looked at what was going on in Russia without despair and without dismally racking his brains over it. Had he been asked what he thought of the state of Russia, he would have said that it was not his business to think about it, that Kut\u00fazov and others were there for that purpose, but that he had heard that the regiments were to be made up to their full strength, that fighting would probably go on for a long time yet, and that things being so it was quite likely he might be in command of a regiment in a couple of years\u2019 time.\n\nAs he looked at the matter in this way, he learned that he was being sent to Vor\u00f3nezh to buy remounts for his division, not only without regret at being prevented from taking part in the coming battle, but with the greatest pleasure\u2014which he did not conceal and which his comrades fully understood.\n\nA few days before the battle of Borodin\u00f3, Nicholas received the necessary money and warrants, and having sent some hussars on in advance, he set out with post horses for Vor\u00f3nezh.\n\nOnly a man who has experienced it\u2014that is, has passed some months continuously in an atmosphere of campaigning and war\u2014can understand the delight Nicholas felt when he escaped from the region covered by the army\u2019s foraging operations, provision trains, and hospitals. When\u2014free from soldiers, wagons, and the filthy traces of a camp\u2014he saw villages with peasants and peasant women, gentlemen\u2019s country houses, fields where cattle were grazing, posthouses with stationmasters asleep in them, he rejoiced as though seeing all this for the first time. What for a long while specially surprised and delighted him were the women, young and healthy, without a dozen officers making up to each of them; women, too, who were pleased and flattered that a passing officer should joke with them.\n\nIn the highest spirits Nicholas arrived at night at a hotel in Vor\u00f3nezh, ordered things he had long been deprived of in camp, and next day, very clean-shaven and in a full-dress uniform he had not worn for a long time, went to present himself to the authorities.\n\nThe commander of the militia was a civilian general, an old man who was evidently pleased with his military designation and rank. He received Nicholas brusquely (imagining this to be characteristically military) and questioned him with an important air, as if considering the general progress of affairs and approving and disapproving with full right to do so. Nicholas was in such good spirits that this merely amused him.\n\nFrom the commander of the militia he drove to the governor. The governor was a brisk little man, very simple and affable. He indicated the stud farms at which Nicholas might procure horses, recommended to him a horse dealer in the town and a landowner fourteen miles out of town who had the best horses, and promised to assist him in every way.\n\n\u201cYou are Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v\u2019s son? My wife was a great friend of your mother\u2019s. We are at home on Thursdays\u2014today is Thursday, so please come and see us quite informally,\u201d said the governor, taking leave of him.\n\nImmediately on leaving the governor\u2019s, Nicholas hired post horses and, taking his squadron quartermaster with him, drove at a gallop to the landowner, fourteen miles away, who had the stud. Everything seemed to him pleasant and easy during that first part of his stay in Vor\u00f3nezh and, as usually happens when a man is in a pleasant state of mind, everything went well and easily.\n\nThe landowner to whom Nicholas went was a bachelor, an old cavalryman, a horse fancier, a sportsman, the possessor of some century-old brandy and some old Hungarian wine, who had a snuggery where he smoked, and who owned some splendid horses.\n\nIn very few words Nicholas bought seventeen picked stallions for six thousand rubles\u2014to serve, as he said, as samples of his remounts. After dining and taking rather too much of the Hungarian wine, Nicholas\u2014having exchanged kisses with the landowner, with whom he was already on the friendliest terms\u2014galloped back over abominable roads, in the brightest frame of mind, continually urging on the driver so as to be in time for the governor\u2019s party.\n\nWhen he had changed, poured water over his head, and scented himself, Nicholas arrived at the governor\u2019s rather late, but with the phrase \u201cbetter late than never\u201d on his lips.\n\nIt was not a ball, nor had dancing been announced, but everyone knew that Catherine Petr\u00f3vna would play valses and the \u00e9cossaise on the clavichord and that there would be dancing, and so everyone had come as to a ball.\n\nProvincial life in 1812 went on very much as usual, but with this difference, that it was livelier in the towns in consequence of the arrival of many wealthy families from Moscow, and as in everything that went on in Russia at that time a special recklessness was noticeable, an \u201cin for a penny, in for a pound\u2014who cares?\u201d spirit, and the inevitable small talk, instead of turning on the weather and mutual acquaintances, now turned on Moscow, the army, and Napoleon.\n\nThe society gathered together at the governor\u2019s was the best in Vor\u00f3nezh.\n\nThere were a great many ladies and some of Nicholas\u2019 Moscow acquaintances, but there were no men who could at all vie with the cavalier of St. George, the hussar remount officer, the good-natured and well-bred Count Rost\u00f3v. Among the men was an Italian prisoner, an officer of the French army; and Nicholas felt that the presence of that prisoner enhanced his own importance as a Russian hero. The Italian was, as it were, a war trophy. Nicholas felt this, it seemed to him that everyone regarded the Italian in the same light, and he treated him cordially though with dignity and restraint.\n\nAs soon as Nicholas entered in his hussar uniform, diffusing around him a fragrance of perfume and wine, and had uttered the words \u201cbetter late than never\u201d and heard them repeated several times by others, people clustered around him; all eyes turned on him, and he felt at once that he had entered into his proper position in the province\u2014that of a universal favorite: a very pleasant position, and intoxicatingly so after his long privations. At posting stations, at inns, and in the landowner\u2019s snuggery, maidservants had been flattered by his notice, and here too at the governor\u2019s party there were (as it seemed to Nicholas) an inexhaustible number of pretty young women, married and unmarried, impatiently awaiting his notice. The women and girls flirted with him and, from the first day, the people concerned themselves to get this fine young daredevil of an hussar married and settled down. Among these was the governor\u2019s wife herself, who welcomed Rost\u00f3v as a near relative and called him \u201cNicholas.\u201d\n\nCatherine Petr\u00f3vna did actually play valses and the \u00e9cossaise, and dancing began in which Nicholas still further captivated the provincial society by his agility. His particularly free manner of dancing even surprised them all. Nicholas was himself rather surprised at the way he danced that evening. He had never danced like that in Moscow and would even have considered such a very free and easy manner improper and in bad form, but here he felt it incumbent on him to astonish them all by something unusual, something they would have to accept as the regular thing in the capital though new to them in the provinces.\n\nAll the evening Nicholas paid attention to a blue-eyed, plump and pleasing little blonde, the wife of one of the provincial officials. With the na\u00efve conviction of young men in a merry mood that other men\u2019s wives were created for them, Rost\u00f3v did not leave the lady\u2019s side and treated her husband in a friendly and conspiratorial style, as if, without speaking of it, they knew how capitally Nicholas and the lady would get on together. The husband, however, did not seem to share that conviction and tried to behave morosely with Rost\u00f3v. But the latter\u2019s good-natured na\u00efvet\u00e9 was so boundless that sometimes even he involuntarily yielded to Nicholas\u2019 good humor. Toward the end of the evening, however, as the wife\u2019s face grew more flushed and animated, the husband\u2019s became more and more melancholy and solemn, as though there were but a given amount of animation between them and as the wife\u2019s share increased the husband\u2019s diminished.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNicholas sat leaning slightly forward in an armchair, bending closely over the blonde lady and paying her mythological compliments with a smile that never left his face. Jauntily shifting the position of his legs in their tight riding breeches, diffusing an odor of perfume, and admiring his partner, himself, and the fine outlines of his legs in their well-fitting Hessian boots, Nicholas told the blonde lady that he wished to run away with a certain lady here in Vor\u00f3nezh.\n\n\u201cWhich lady?\u201d\n\n\u201cA charming lady, a divine one. Her eyes\u201d (Nicholas looked at his partner) \u201care blue, her mouth coral and ivory; her figure\u201d (he glanced at her shoulders) \u201clike Diana\u2019s....\u201d\n\nThe husband came up and sullenly asked his wife what she was talking about.\n\n\u201cAh, Nik\u00edta Iv\u00e1nych!\u201d cried Nicholas, rising politely, and as if wishing Nik\u00edta Iv\u00e1nych to share his joke, he began to tell him of his intention to elope with a blonde lady.\n\nThe husband smiled gloomily, the wife gaily. The governor\u2019s good-natured wife came up with a look of disapproval.\n\n\u201cAnna Ign\u00e1tyevna wants to see you, Nicholas,\u201d said she, pronouncing the name so that Nicholas at once understood that Anna Ign\u00e1tyevna was a very important person. \u201cCome, Nicholas! You know you let me call you so?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes, Aunt. Who is she?\u201d\n\n\u201cAnna Ign\u00e1tyevna Malv\u00edntseva. She has heard from her niece how you rescued her.... Can you guess?\u201d\n\n\u201cI rescued such a lot of them!\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cHer niece, Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya. She is here in Vor\u00f3nezh with her aunt. Oho! How you blush. Why, are...?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot a bit! Please don\u2019t, Aunt!\u201d\n\n\u201cVery well, very well!... Oh, what a fellow you are!\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s wife led him up to a tall and very stout old lady with a blue headdress, who had just finished her game of cards with the most important personages of the town. This was Malv\u00edntseva, Princess Mary\u2019s aunt on her mother\u2019s side, a rich, childless widow who always lived in Vor\u00f3nezh. When Rost\u00f3v approached her she was standing settling up for the game. She looked at him and, screwing up her eyes sternly, continued to upbraid the general who had won from her.\n\n\u201cVery pleased, mon cher,\u201d she then said, holding out her hand to Nicholas. \u201cPray come and see me.\u201d\n\nAfter a few words about Princess Mary and her late father, whom Malv\u00edntseva had evidently not liked, and having asked what Nicholas knew of Prince Andrew, who also was evidently no favorite of hers, the important old lady dismissed Nicholas after repeating her invitation to come to see her.\n\nNicholas promised to come and blushed again as he bowed. At the mention of Princess Mary he experienced a feeling of shyness and even of fear, which he himself did not understand.\n\nWhen he had parted from Malv\u00edntseva Nicholas wished to return to the dancing, but the governor\u2019s little wife placed her plump hand on his sleeve and, saying that she wanted to have a talk with him, led him to her sitting room, from which those who were there immediately withdrew so as not to be in her way.\n\n\u201cDo you know, dear boy,\u201d began the governor\u2019s wife with a serious expression on her kind little face, \u201cthat really would be the match for you: would you like me to arrange it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhom do you mean, Aunt?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cI will make a match for you with the princess. Catherine Petr\u00f3vna speaks of Lily, but I say, no\u2014the princess! Do you want me to do it? I am sure your mother will be grateful to me. What a charming girl she is, really! And she is not at all so plain, either.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all,\u201d replied Nicholas as if offended at the idea. \u201cAs befits a soldier, Aunt, I don\u2019t force myself on anyone or refuse anything,\u201d he said before he had time to consider what he was saying.\n\n\u201cWell then, remember, this is not a joke!\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course not!\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d the governor\u2019s wife said as if talking to herself. \u201cBut, my dear boy, among other things you are too attentive to the other, the blonde. One is sorry for the husband, really....\u201d\n\n\u201cOh no, we are good friends with him,\u201d said Nicholas in the simplicity of his heart; it did not enter his head that a pastime so pleasant to himself might not be pleasant to someone else.\n\n\u201cBut what nonsense I have been saying to the governor\u2019s wife!\u201d thought Nicholas suddenly at supper. \u201cShe will really begin to arrange a match... and S\u00f3nya...?\u201d And on taking leave of the governor\u2019s wife, when she again smilingly said to him, \u201cWell then, remember!\u201d he drew her aside.\n\n\u201cBut see here, to tell the truth, Aunt...\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is it, my dear? Come, let\u2019s sit down here,\u201d said she.\n\nNicholas suddenly felt a desire and need to tell his most intimate thoughts (which he would not have told to his mother, his sister, or his friend) to this woman who was almost a stranger. When he afterwards recalled that impulse to unsolicited and inexplicable frankness which had very important results for him, it seemed to him\u2014as it seems to everyone in such cases\u2014that it was merely some silly whim that seized him: yet that burst of frankness, together with other trifling events, had immense consequences for him and for all his family.\n\n\u201cYou see, Aunt, Mamma has long wanted me to marry an heiress, but the very idea of marrying for money is repugnant to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cOh yes, I understand,\u201d said the governor\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cBut Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya\u2014that\u2019s another matter. I will tell you the truth. In the first place I like her very much, I feel drawn to her; and then, after I met her under such circumstances\u2014so strangely, the idea often occurred to me: \u2018This is fate.\u2019 Especially if you remember that Mamma had long been thinking of it; but I had never happened to meet her before, somehow it had always happened that we did not meet. And as long as my sister Nat\u00e1sha was engaged to her brother it was of course out of the question for me to think of marrying her. And it must needs happen that I should meet her just when Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s engagement had been broken off... and then everything... So you see... I never told this to anyone and never will, only to you.\u201d\n\nThe governor\u2019s wife pressed his elbow gratefully.\n\n\u201cYou know S\u00f3nya, my cousin? I love her, and promised to marry her, and will do so.... So you see there can be no question about\u2014\u201d said Nicholas incoherently and blushing.\n\n\u201cMy dear boy, what a way to look at it! You know S\u00f3nya has nothing and you yourself say your Papa\u2019s affairs are in a very bad way. And what about your mother? It would kill her, that\u2019s one thing. And what sort of life would it be for S\u00f3nya\u2014if she\u2019s a girl with a heart? Your mother in despair, and you all ruined.... No, my dear, you and S\u00f3nya ought to understand that.\u201d\n\nNicholas remained silent. It comforted him to hear these arguments.\n\n\u201cAll the same, Aunt, it is impossible,\u201d he rejoined with a sigh, after a short pause. \u201cBesides, would the princess have me? And besides, she is now in mourning. How can one think of it!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut you don\u2019t suppose I\u2019m going to get you married at once? There is always a right way of doing things,\u201d replied the governor\u2019s wife.\n\n\u201cWhat a matchmaker you are, Aunt...\u201d said Nicholas, kissing her plump little hand.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOn reaching Moscow after her meeting with Rost\u00f3v, Princess Mary had found her nephew there with his tutor, and a letter from Prince Andrew giving her instructions how to get to her Aunt Malv\u00edntseva at Vor\u00f3nezh. That feeling akin to temptation which had tormented her during her father\u2019s illness, since his death, and especially since her meeting with Rost\u00f3v was smothered by arrangements for the journey, anxiety about her brother, settling in a new house, meeting new people, and attending to her nephew\u2019s education. She was sad. Now, after a month passed in quiet surroundings, she felt more and more deeply the loss of her father which was associated in her mind with the ruin of Russia. She was agitated and incessantly tortured by the thought of the dangers to which her brother, the only intimate person now remaining to her, was exposed. She was worried too about her nephew\u2019s education for which she had always felt herself incompetent, but in the depths of her soul she felt at peace\u2014a peace arising from consciousness of having stifled those personal dreams and hopes that had been on the point of awakening within her and were related to her meeting with Rost\u00f3v.\n\nThe day after her party the governor\u2019s wife came to see Malv\u00edntseva and, after discussing her plan with the aunt, remarked that though under present circumstances a formal betrothal was, of course, not to be thought of, all the same the young people might be brought together and could get to know one another. Malv\u00edntseva expressed approval, and the governor\u2019s wife began to speak of Rost\u00f3v in Mary\u2019s presence, praising him and telling how he had blushed when Princess Mary\u2019s name was mentioned. But Princess Mary experienced a painful rather than a joyful feeling\u2014her mental tranquillity was destroyed, and desires, doubts, self-reproach, and hopes reawoke.\n\nDuring the two days that elapsed before Rost\u00f3v called, Princess Mary continually thought of how she ought to behave to him. First she decided not to come to the drawing room when he called to see her aunt\u2014that it would not be proper for her, in her deep mourning, to receive visitors; then she thought this would be rude after what he had done for her; then it occurred to her that her aunt and the governor\u2019s wife had intentions concerning herself and Rost\u00f3v\u2014their looks and words at times seemed to confirm this supposition\u2014then she told herself that only she, with her sinful nature, could think this of them: they could not forget that situated as she was, while still wearing deep mourning, such matchmaking would be an insult to her and to her father\u2019s memory. Assuming that she did go down to see him, Princess Mary imagined the words he would say to her and what she would say to him, and these words sometimes seemed undeservedly cold and then to mean too much. More than anything she feared lest the confusion she felt might overwhelm her and betray her as soon as she saw him.\n\nBut when on Sunday after church the footman announced in the drawing room that Count Rost\u00f3v had called, the princess showed no confusion, only a slight blush suffused her cheeks and her eyes lit up with a new and radiant light.\n\n\u201cYou have met him, Aunt?\u201d said she in a calm voice, unable herself to understand that she could be outwardly so calm and natural.\n\nWhen Rost\u00f3v entered the room, the princess dropped her eyes for an instant, as if to give the visitor time to greet her aunt, and then just as Nicholas turned to her she raised her head and met his look with shining eyes. With a movement full of dignity and grace she half rose with a smile of pleasure, held out her slender, delicate hand to him, and began to speak in a voice in which for the first time new deep womanly notes vibrated. Mademoiselle Bourienne, who was in the drawing room, looked at Princess Mary in bewildered surprise. Herself a consummate coquette, she could not have maneuvered better on meeting a man she wished to attract.\n\n\u201cEither black is particularly becoming to her or she really has greatly improved without my having noticed it. And above all, what tact and grace!\u201d thought Mademoiselle Bourienne.\n\nHad Princess Mary been capable of reflection at that moment, she would have been more surprised than Mademoiselle Bourienne at the change that had taken place in herself. From the moment she recognized that dear, loved face, a new life force took possession of her and compelled her to speak and act apart from her own will. From the time Rost\u00f3v entered, her face became suddenly transformed. It was as if a light had been kindled in a carved and painted lantern and the intricate, skillful, artistic work on its sides, that previously seemed dark, coarse, and meaningless, was suddenly shown up in unexpected and striking beauty. For the first time all that pure, spiritual, inward travail through which she had lived appeared on the surface. All her inward labor, her dissatisfaction with herself, her sufferings, her strivings after goodness, her meekness, love, and self-sacrifice\u2014all this now shone in those radiant eyes, in her delicate smile, and in every trait of her gentle face.\n\nRost\u00f3v saw all this as clearly as if he had known her whole life. He felt that the being before him was quite different from, and better than, anyone he had met before, and above all better than himself.\n\nTheir conversation was very simple and unimportant. They spoke of the war, and like everyone else unconsciously exaggerated their sorrow about it; they spoke of their last meeting\u2014Nicholas trying to change the subject\u2014they talked of the governor\u2019s kind wife, of Nicholas\u2019 relations, and of Princess Mary\u2019s.\n\nShe did not talk about her brother, diverting the conversation as soon as her aunt mentioned Andrew. Evidently she could speak of Russia\u2019s misfortunes with a certain artificiality, but her brother was too near her heart and she neither could nor would speak lightly of him. Nicholas noticed this, as he noticed every shade of Princess Mary\u2019s character with an observation unusual to him, and everything confirmed his conviction that she was a quite unusual and extraordinary being. Nicholas blushed and was confused when people spoke to him about the princess (as she did when he was mentioned) and even when he thought of her, but in her presence he felt quite at ease, and said not at all what he had prepared, but what, quite appropriately, occurred to him at the moment.\n\nWhen a pause occurred during his short visit, Nicholas, as is usual when there are children, turned to Prince Andrew\u2019s little son, caressing him and asking whether he would like to be an hussar. He took the boy on his knee, played with him, and looked round at Princess Mary. With a softened, happy, timid look she watched the boy she loved in the arms of the man she loved. Nicholas also noticed that look and, as if understanding it, flushed with pleasure and began to kiss the boy with good natured playfulness.\n\nAs she was in mourning Princess Mary did not go out into society, and Nicholas did not think it the proper thing to visit her again; but all the same the governor\u2019s wife went on with her matchmaking, passing on to Nicholas the flattering things Princess Mary said of him and vice versa, and insisting on his declaring himself to Princess Mary. For this purpose she arranged a meeting between the young people at the bishop\u2019s house before Mass.\n\nThough Rost\u00f3v told the governor\u2019s wife that he would not make any declaration to Princess Mary, he promised to go.\n\nAs at Tilsit Rost\u00f3v had not allowed himself to doubt that what everybody considered right was right, so now, after a short but sincere struggle between his effort to arrange his life by his own sense of justice, and in obedient submission to circumstances, he chose the latter and yielded to the power he felt irresistibly carrying him he knew not where. He knew that after his promise to S\u00f3nya it would be what he deemed base to declare his feelings to Princess Mary. And he knew that he would never act basely. But he also knew (or rather felt at the bottom of his heart) that by resigning himself now to the force of circumstances and to those who were guiding him, he was not only doing nothing wrong, but was doing something very important\u2014more important than anything he had ever done in his life.\n\nAfter meeting Princess Mary, though the course of his life went on externally as before, all his former amusements lost their charm for him and he often thought about her. But he never thought about her as he had thought of all the young ladies without exception whom he had met in society, nor as he had for a long time, and at one time rapturously, thought about S\u00f3nya. He had pictured each of those young ladies as almost all honest-hearted young men do, that is, as a possible wife, adapting her in his imagination to all the conditions of married life: a white dressing gown, his wife at the tea table, his wife\u2019s carriage, little ones, Mamma and Papa, their relations to her, and so on\u2014and these pictures of the future had given him pleasure. But with Princess Mary, to whom they were trying to get him engaged, he could never picture anything of future married life. If he tried, his pictures seemed incongruous and false. It made him afraid.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nThe dreadful news of the battle of Borodin\u00f3, of our losses in killed and wounded, and the still more terrible news of the loss of Moscow reached Vor\u00f3nezh in the middle of September. Princess Mary, having learned of her brother\u2019s wound only from the Gazette and having no definite news of him, prepared (so Nicholas heard, he had not seen her again himself) to set off in search of Prince Andrew.\n\nWhen he received the news of the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and the abandonment of Moscow, Rost\u00f3v was not seized with despair, anger, the desire for vengeance, or any feeling of that kind, but everything in Vor\u00f3nezh suddenly seemed to him dull and tiresome, and he experienced an indefinite feeling of shame and awkwardness. The conversations he heard seemed to him insincere; he did not know how to judge all these affairs and felt that only in the regiment would everything again become clear to him. He made haste to finish buying the horses, and often became unreasonably angry with his servant and squadron quartermaster.\n\nA few days before his departure a special thanksgiving, at which Nicholas was present, was held in the cathedral for the Russian victory. He stood a little behind the governor and held himself with military decorum through the service, meditating on a great variety of subjects. When the service was over the governor\u2019s wife beckoned him to her.\n\n\u201cHave you seen the princess?\u201d she asked, indicating with a movement of her head a lady standing on the opposite side, beyond the choir.\n\nNicholas immediately recognized Princess Mary not so much by the profile he saw under her bonnet as by the feeling of solicitude, timidity, and pity that immediately overcame him. Princess Mary, evidently engrossed by her thoughts, was crossing herself for the last time before leaving the church.\n\nNicholas looked at her face with surprise. It was the same face he had seen before, there was the same general expression of refined, inner, spiritual labor, but now it was quite differently lit up. There was a pathetic expression of sorrow, prayer, and hope in it. As had occurred before when she was present, Nicholas went up to her without waiting to be prompted by the governor\u2019s wife and not asking himself whether or not it was right and proper to address her here in church, and told her he had heard of her trouble and sympathized with his whole soul. As soon as she heard his voice a vivid glow kindled in her face, lighting up both her sorrow and her joy.\n\n\u201cThere is one thing I wanted to tell you, Princess,\u201d said Rost\u00f3v. \u201cIt is that if your brother, Prince Andrew Nikol\u00e1evich, were not living, it would have been at once announced in the Gazette, as he is a colonel.\u201d\n\nThe princess looked at him, not grasping what he was saying, but cheered by the expression of regretful sympathy on his face.\n\n\u201cAnd I have known so many cases of a splinter wound\u201d (the Gazette said it was a shell) \u201ceither proving fatal at once or being very slight,\u201d continued Nicholas. \u201cWe must hope for the best, and I am sure...\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary interrupted him.\n\n\u201cOh, that would be so dread...\u201d she began and, prevented by agitation from finishing, she bent her head with a movement as graceful as everything she did in his presence and, looking up at him gratefully, went out, following her aunt.\n\nThat evening Nicholas did not go out, but stayed at home to settle some accounts with the horse dealers. When he had finished that business it was already too late to go anywhere but still too early to go to bed, and for a long time he paced up and down the room, reflecting on his life, a thing he rarely did.\n\nPrincess Mary had made an agreeable impression on him when he had met her in Smol\u00e9nsk province. His having encountered her in such exceptional circumstances, and his mother having at one time mentioned her to him as a good match, had drawn his particular attention to her. When he met her again in Vor\u00f3nezh the impression she made on him was not merely pleasing but powerful. Nicholas had been struck by the peculiar moral beauty he observed in her at this time. He was, however, preparing to go away and it had not entered his head to regret that he was thus depriving himself of chances of meeting her. But that day\u2019s encounter in church had, he felt, sunk deeper than was desirable for his peace of mind. That pale, sad, refined face, that radiant look, those gentle graceful gestures, and especially the deep and tender sorrow expressed in all her features agitated him and evoked his sympathy. In men Rost\u00f3v could not bear to see the expression of a higher spiritual life (that was why he did not like Prince Andrew) and he referred to it contemptuously as philosophy and dreaminess, but in Princess Mary that very sorrow which revealed the depth of a whole spiritual world foreign to him was an irresistible attraction.\n\n\u201cShe must be a wonderful woman. A real angel!\u201d he said to himself. \u201cWhy am I not free? Why was I in such a hurry with S\u00f3nya?\u201d And he involuntarily compared the two: the lack of spirituality in the one and the abundance of it in the other\u2014a spirituality he himself lacked and therefore valued most highly. He tried to picture what would happen were he free. How he would propose to her and how she would become his wife. But no, he could not imagine that. He felt awed, and no clear picture presented itself to his mind. He had long ago pictured to himself a future with S\u00f3nya, and that was all clear and simple just because it had all been thought out and he knew all there was in S\u00f3nya, but it was impossible to picture a future with Princess Mary, because he did not understand her but simply loved her.\n\nReveries about S\u00f3nya had had something merry and playful in them, but to dream of Princess Mary was always difficult and a little frightening.\n\n\u201cHow she prayed!\u201d he thought. \u201cIt was plain that her whole soul was in her prayer. Yes, that was the prayer that moves mountains, and I am sure her prayer will be answered. Why don\u2019t I pray for what I want?\u201d he suddenly thought. \u201cWhat do I want? To be free, released from S\u00f3nya... She was right,\u201d he thought, remembering what the governor\u2019s wife had said: \u201cNothing but misfortune can come of marrying S\u00f3nya. Muddles, grief for Mamma... business difficulties... muddles, terrible muddles! Besides, I don\u2019t love her\u2014not as I should. O, God! release me from this dreadful, inextricable position!\u201d he suddenly began to pray. \u201cYes, prayer can move mountains, but one must have faith and not pray as Nat\u00e1sha and I used to as children, that the snow might turn into sugar\u2014and then run out into the yard to see whether it had done so. No, but I am not praying for trifles now,\u201d he thought as he put his pipe down in a corner, and folding his hands placed himself before the icon. Softened by memories of Princess Mary he began to pray as he had not done for a long time. Tears were in his eyes and in his throat when the door opened and Lavr\u00fashka came in with some papers.\n\n\u201cBlockhead! Why do you come in without being called?\u201d cried Nicholas, quickly changing his attitude.\n\n\u201cFrom the governor,\u201d said Lavr\u00fashka in a sleepy voice. \u201cA courier has arrived and there\u2019s a letter for you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, all right, thanks. You can go!\u201d\n\nNicholas took the two letters, one of which was from his mother and the other from S\u00f3nya. He recognized them by the handwriting and opened S\u00f3nya\u2019s fi", "sequence": 24}, {"offset": 2500000, "text": "rst. He had read only a few lines when he turned pale and his eyes opened wide with fear and joy.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not possible!\u201d he cried aloud.\n\nUnable to sit still he paced up and down the room holding the letter and reading it. He glanced through it, then read it again, and then again, and standing still in the middle of the room he raised his shoulders, stretching out his hands, with his mouth wide open and his eyes fixed. What he had just been praying for with confidence that God would hear him had come to pass; but Nicholas was as much astonished as if it were something extraordinary and unexpected, and as if the very fact that it had happened so quickly proved that it had not come from God to whom he had prayed, but by some ordinary coincidence.\n\nThis unexpected and, as it seemed to Nicholas, quite voluntary letter from S\u00f3nya freed him from the knot that fettered him and from which there had seemed no escape. She wrote that the last unfortunate events\u2014the loss of almost the whole of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 Moscow property\u2014and the countess\u2019 repeatedly expressed wish that Nicholas should marry Princess Bolk\u00f3nskaya, together with his silence and coldness of late, had all combined to make her decide to release him from his promise and set him completely free.\n\nIt would be too painful to me to think that I might be a cause of sorrow or discord in the family that has been so good to me (she wrote), and my love has no aim but the happiness of those I love; so, Nicholas, I beg you to consider yourself free, and to be assured that, in spite of everything, no one can love you more than does\n\nYour S\u00f3nya\n\nBoth letters were written from Tr\u00f3itsa. The other, from the countess, described their last days in Moscow, their departure, the fire, and the destruction of all their property. In this letter the countess also mentioned that Prince Andrew was among the wounded traveling with them; his state was very critical, but the doctor said there was now more hope. S\u00f3nya and Nat\u00e1sha were nursing him.\n\nNext day Nicholas took his mother\u2019s letter and went to see Princess Mary. Neither he nor she said a word about what \u201cNat\u00e1sha nursing him\u201d might mean, but thanks to this letter Nicholas suddenly became almost as intimate with the princess as if they were relations.\n\nThe following day he saw Princess Mary off on her journey to Yarosl\u00e1vl, and a few days later left to rejoin his regiment.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nS\u00f3nya\u2019s letter written from Tr\u00f3itsa, which had come as an answer to Nicholas\u2019 prayer, was prompted by this: the thought of getting Nicholas married to an heiress occupied the old countess\u2019 mind more and more. She knew that S\u00f3nya was the chief obstacle to this happening, and S\u00f3nya\u2019s life in the countess\u2019 house had grown harder and harder, especially after they had received a letter from Nicholas telling of his meeting with Princess Mary in Boguch\u00e1rovo. The countess let no occasion slip of making humiliating or cruel allusions to S\u00f3nya.\n\nBut a few days before they left Moscow, moved and excited by all that was going on, she called S\u00f3nya to her and, instead of reproaching and making demands on her, tearfully implored her to sacrifice herself and repay all that the family had done for her by breaking off her engagement with Nicholas.\n\n\u201cI shall not be at peace till you promise me this.\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya burst into hysterical tears and replied through her sobs that she would do anything and was prepared for anything, but gave no actual promise and could not bring herself to decide to do what was demanded of her. She must sacrifice herself for the family that had reared and brought her up. To sacrifice herself for others was S\u00f3nya\u2019s habit. Her position in the house was such that only by sacrifice could she show her worth, and she was accustomed to this and loved doing it. But in all her former acts of self-sacrifice she had been happily conscious that they raised her in her own esteem and in that of others, and so made her more worthy of Nicholas whom she loved more than anything in the world. But now they wanted her to sacrifice the very thing that constituted the whole reward for her self-sacrifice and the whole meaning of her life. And for the first time she felt bitterness against those who had been her benefactors only to torture her the more painfully; she felt jealous of Nat\u00e1sha who had never experienced anything of this sort, had never needed to sacrifice herself, but made others sacrifice themselves for her and yet was beloved by everybody. And for the first time S\u00f3nya felt that out of her pure, quiet love for Nicholas a passionate feeling was beginning to grow up which was stronger than principle, virtue, or religion. Under the influence of this feeling S\u00f3nya, whose life of dependence had taught her involuntarily to be secretive, having answered the countess in vague general terms, avoided talking with her and resolved to wait till she should see Nicholas, not in order to set him free but on the contrary at that meeting to bind him to her forever.\n\nThe bustle and terror of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 last days in Moscow stifled the gloomy thoughts that oppressed S\u00f3nya. She was glad to find escape from them in practical activity. But when she heard of Prince Andrew\u2019s presence in their house, despite her sincere pity for him and for Nat\u00e1sha, she was seized by a joyful and superstitious feeling that God did not intend her to be separated from Nicholas. She knew that Nat\u00e1sha loved no one but Prince Andrew and had never ceased to love him. She knew that being thrown together again under such terrible circumstances they would again fall in love with one another, and that Nicholas would then not be able to marry Princess Mary as they would be within the prohibited degrees of affinity. Despite all the terror of what had happened during those last days and during the first days of their journey, this feeling that Providence was intervening in her personal affairs cheered S\u00f3nya.\n\nAt the Tr\u00f3itsa monastery the Rost\u00f3vs first broke their journey for a whole day.\n\nThree large rooms were assigned to them in the monastery hostelry, one of which was occupied by Prince Andrew. The wounded man was much better that day and Nat\u00e1sha was sitting with him. In the next room sat the count and countess respectfully conversing with the prior, who was calling on them as old acquaintances and benefactors of the monastery. S\u00f3nya was there too, tormented by curiosity as to what Prince Andrew and Nat\u00e1sha were talking about. She heard the sound of their voices through the door. That door opened and Nat\u00e1sha came out, looking excited. Not noticing the monk, who had risen to greet her and was drawing back the wide sleeve on his right arm, she went up to S\u00f3nya and took her hand.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, what are you about? Come here!\u201d said the countess.\n\nNat\u00e1sha went up to the monk for his blessing, and he advised her to pray for aid to God and His saint.\n\nAs soon as the prior withdrew, Nat\u00e1sha took her friend by the hand and went with her into the unoccupied room.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya, will he live?\u201d she asked. \u201cS\u00f3nya, how happy I am, and how unhappy!... S\u00f3nya, dovey, everything is as it used to be. If only he lives! He cannot... because... because... of...\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha burst into tears.\n\n\u201cYes! I knew it! Thank God!\u201d murmured S\u00f3nya. \u201cHe will live.\u201d\n\nS\u00f3nya was not less agitated than her friend by the latter\u2019s fear and grief and by her own personal feelings which she shared with no one. Sobbing, she kissed and comforted Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cIf only he lives!\u201d she thought. Having wept, talked, and wiped away their tears, the two friends went together to Prince Andrew\u2019s door. Nat\u00e1sha opened it cautiously and glanced into the room, S\u00f3nya standing beside her at the half-open door.\n\nPrince Andrew was lying raised high on three pillows. His pale face was calm, his eyes closed, and they could see his regular breathing.\n\n\u201cO, Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d S\u00f3nya suddenly almost screamed, catching her companion\u2019s arm and stepping back from the door.\n\n\u201cWhat? What is it?\u201d asked Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s that, that...\u201d said S\u00f3nya, with a white face and trembling lips.\n\nNat\u00e1sha softly closed the door and went with S\u00f3nya to the window, not yet understanding what the latter was telling her.\n\n\u201cYou remember,\u201d said S\u00f3nya with a solemn and frightened expression. \u201cYou remember when I looked in the mirror for you... at Otr\u00e1dnoe at Christmas? Do you remember what I saw?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha opening her eyes wide, and vaguely recalling that S\u00f3nya had told her something about Prince Andrew whom she had seen lying down.\n\n\u201cYou remember?\u201d S\u00f3nya went on. \u201cI saw it then and told everybody, you and Duny\u00e1sha. I saw him lying on a bed,\u201d said she, making a gesture with her hand and a lifted finger at each detail, \u201cand that he had his eyes closed and was covered just with a pink quilt, and that his hands were folded,\u201d she concluded, convincing herself that the details she had just seen were exactly what she had seen in the mirror.\n\nShe had in fact seen nothing then but had mentioned the first thing that came into her head, but what she had invented then seemed to her now as real as any other recollection. She not only remembered what she had then said\u2014that he turned to look at her and smiled and was covered with something red\u2014but was firmly convinced that she had then seen and said that he was covered with a pink quilt and that his eyes were closed.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, it really was pink!\u201d cried Nat\u00e1sha, who now thought she too remembered the word pink being used, and saw in this the most extraordinary and mysterious part of the prediction.\n\n\u201cBut what does it mean?\u201d she added meditatively.\n\n\u201cOh, I don\u2019t know, it is all so strange,\u201d replied S\u00f3nya, clutching at her head.\n\nA few minutes later Prince Andrew rang and Nat\u00e1sha went to him, but S\u00f3nya, feeling unusually excited and touched, remained at the window thinking about the strangeness of what had occurred.\n\n\nThey had an opportunity that day to send letters to the army, and the countess was writing to her son.\n\n\u201cS\u00f3nya!\u201d said the countess, raising her eyes from her letter as her niece passed, \u201cS\u00f3nya, won\u2019t you write to Nicholas?\u201d She spoke in a soft, tremulous voice, and in the weary eyes that looked over her spectacles S\u00f3nya read all that the countess meant to convey with these words. Those eyes expressed entreaty, shame at having to ask, fear of a refusal, and readiness for relentless hatred in case of such refusal.\n\nS\u00f3nya went up to the countess and, kneeling down, kissed her hand.\n\n\u201cYes, Mamma, I will write,\u201d said she.\n\nS\u00f3nya was softened, excited, and touched by all that had occurred that day, especially by the mysterious fulfillment she had just seen of her vision. Now that she knew that the renewal of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s relations with Prince Andrew would prevent Nicholas from marrying Princess Mary, she was joyfully conscious of a return of that self-sacrificing spirit in which she was accustomed to live and loved to live. So with a joyful consciousness of performing a magnanimous deed\u2014interrupted several times by the tears that dimmed her velvety black eyes\u2014she wrote that touching letter the arrival of which had so amazed Nicholas.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe officer and soldiers who had arrested Pierre treated him with hostility but yet with respect, in the guardhouse to which he was taken. In their attitude toward him could still be felt both uncertainty as to who he might be\u2014perhaps a very important person\u2014and hostility as a result of their recent personal conflict with him.\n\nBut when the guard was relieved next morning, Pierre felt that for the new guard\u2014both officers and men\u2014he was not as interesting as he had been to his captors; and in fact the guard of the second day did not recognize in this big, stout man in a peasant coat the vigorous person who had fought so desperately with the marauder and the convoy and had uttered those solemn words about saving a child; they saw in him only No. 17 of the captured Russians, arrested and detained for some reason by order of the Higher Command. If they noticed anything remarkable about Pierre, it was only his unabashed, meditative concentration and thoughtfulness, and the way he spoke French, which struck them as surprisingly good. In spite of this he was placed that day with the other arrested suspects, as the separate room he had occupied was required by an officer.\n\nAll the Russians confined with Pierre were men of the lowest class and, recognizing him as a gentleman, they all avoided him, more especially as he spoke French. Pierre felt sad at hearing them making fun of him.\n\nThat evening he learned that all these prisoners (he, probably, among them) were to be tried for incendiarism. On the third day he was taken with the others to a house where a French general with a white mustache sat with two colonels and other Frenchmen with scarves on their arms. With the precision and definiteness customary in addressing prisoners, and which is supposed to preclude human frailty, Pierre like the others was questioned as to who he was, where he had been, with what object, and so on.\n\nThese questions, like questions put at trials generally, left the essence of the matter aside, shut out the possibility of that essence\u2019s being revealed, and were designed only to form a channel through which the judges wished the answers of the accused to flow so as to lead to the desired result, namely a conviction. As soon as Pierre began to say anything that did not fit in with that aim, the channel was removed and the water could flow to waste. Pierre felt, moreover, what the accused always feel at their trial, perplexity as to why these questions were put to him. He had a feeling that it was only out of condescension or a kind of civility that this device of placing a channel was employed. He knew he was in these men\u2019s power, that only by force had they brought him there, that force alone gave them the right to demand answers to their questions, and that the sole object of that assembly was to inculpate him. And so, as they had the power and wish to inculpate him, this expedient of an inquiry and trial seemed unnecessary. It was evident that any answer would lead to conviction. When asked what he was doing when he was arrested, Pierre replied in a rather tragic manner that he was restoring to its parents a child he had saved from the flames. Why had he fought the marauder? Pierre answered that he \u201cwas protecting a woman,\u201d and that \u201cto protect a woman who was being insulted was the duty of every man; that...\u201d They interrupted him, for this was not to the point. Why was he in the yard of a burning house where witnesses had seen him? He replied that he had gone out to see what was happening in Moscow. Again they interrupted him: they had not asked where he was going, but why he was found near the fire? Who was he? they asked, repeating their first question, which he had declined to answer. Again he replied that he could not answer it.\n\n\u201cPut that down, that\u2019s bad... very bad,\u201d sternly remarked the general with the white mustache and red flushed face.\n\n\nOn the fourth day fires broke out on the Z\u00fabovski rampart.\n\nPierre and thirteen others were moved to the coach house of a merchant\u2019s house near the Crimean bridge. On his way through the streets Pierre felt stifled by the smoke which seemed to hang over the whole city. Fires were visible on all sides. He did not then realize the significance of the burning of Moscow, and looked at the fires with horror.\n\nHe passed four days in the coach house near the Crimean bridge and during that time learned, from the talk of the French soldiers, that all those confined there were awaiting a decision which might come any day from the marshal. What marshal this was, Pierre could not learn from the soldiers. Evidently for them \u201cthe marshal\u201d represented a very high and rather mysterious power.\n\nThese first days, before the eighth of September when the prisoners were had up for a second examination, were the hardest of all for Pierre.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nOn the eighth of September an officer\u2014a very important one judging by the respect the guards showed him\u2014entered the coach house where the prisoners were. This officer, probably someone on the staff, was holding a paper in his hand, and called over all the Russians there, naming Pierre as \u201cthe man who does not give his name.\u201d Glancing indolently and indifferently at all the prisoners, he ordered the officer in charge to have them decently dressed and tidied up before taking them to the marshal. An hour later a squad of soldiers arrived and Pierre with thirteen others was led to the Virgin\u2019s Field. It was a fine day, sunny after rain, and the air was unusually pure. The smoke did not hang low as on the day when Pierre had been taken from the guardhouse on the Z\u00fabovski rampart, but rose through the pure air in columns. No flames were seen, but columns of smoke rose on all sides, and all Moscow as far as Pierre could see was one vast charred ruin. On all sides there were waste spaces with only stoves and chimney stacks still standing, and here and there the blackened walls of some brick houses. Pierre gazed at the ruins and did not recognize districts he had known well. Here and there he could see churches that had not been burned. The Kr\u00e9mlin, which was not destroyed, gleamed white in the distance with its towers and the belfry of Iv\u00e1n the Great. The domes of the New Convent of the Virgin glittered brightly and its bells were ringing particularly clearly. These bells reminded Pierre that it was Sunday and the feast of the Nativity of the Virgin. But there seemed to be no one to celebrate this holiday: everywhere were blackened ruins, and the few Russians to be seen were tattered and frightened people who tried to hide when they saw the French.\n\nIt was plain that the Russian nest was ruined and destroyed, but in place of the Russian order of life that had been destroyed, Pierre unconsciously felt that a quite different, firm, French order had been established over this ruined nest. He felt this in the looks of the soldiers who, marching in regular ranks briskly and gaily, were escorting him and the other criminals; he felt it in the looks of an important French official in a carriage and pair driven by a soldier, whom they met on the way. He felt it in the merry sounds of regimental music he heard from the left side of the field, and felt and realized it especially from the list of prisoners the French officer had read out when he came that morning. Pierre had been taken by one set of soldiers and led first to one and then to another place with dozens of other men, and it seemed that they might have forgotten him, or confused him with the others. But no: the answers he had given when questioned had come back to him in his designation as \u201cthe man who does not give his name,\u201d and under that appellation, which to Pierre seemed terrible, they were now leading him somewhere with unhesitating assurance on their faces that he and all the other prisoners were exactly the ones they wanted and that they were being taken to the proper place. Pierre felt himself to be an insignificant chip fallen among the wheels of a machine whose action he did not understand but which was working well.\n\nHe and the other prisoners were taken to the right side of the Virgin\u2019s Field, to a large white house with an immense garden not far from the convent. This was Prince Shcherb\u00e1tov\u2019s house, where Pierre had often been in other days, and which, as he learned from the talk of the soldiers, was now occupied by the marshal, the Duke of Eckm\u00fchl (Davout).\n\nThey were taken to the entrance and led into the house one by one. Pierre was the sixth to enter. He was conducted through a glass gallery, an anteroom, and a hall, which were familiar to him, into a long low study at the door of which stood an adjutant.\n\nDavout, spectacles on nose, sat bent over a table at the further end of the room. Pierre went close up to him, but Davout, evidently consulting a paper that lay before him, did not look up. Without raising his eyes, he said in a low voice:\n\n\u201cWho are you?\u201d\n\nPierre was silent because he was incapable of uttering a word. To him Davout was not merely a French general, but a man notorious for his cruelty. Looking at his cold face, as he sat like a stern schoolmaster who was prepared to wait awhile for an answer, Pierre felt that every instant of delay might cost him his life; but he did not know what to say. He did not venture to repeat what he had said at his first examination, yet to disclose his rank and position was dangerous and embarrassing. So he was silent. But before he had decided what to do, Davout raised his head, pushed his spectacles back on his forehead, screwed up his eyes, and looked intently at him.\n\n\u201cI know that man,\u201d he said in a cold, measured tone, evidently calculated to frighten Pierre.\n\nThe chill that had been running down Pierre\u2019s back now seized his head as in a vise.\n\n\u201cYou cannot know me, General, I have never seen you...\u201d\n\n\u201cHe is a Russian spy,\u201d Davout interrupted, addressing another general who was present, but whom Pierre had not noticed.\n\nDavout turned away. With an unexpected reverberation in his voice Pierre rapidly began:\n\n\u201cNo, monseigneur,\u201d he said, suddenly remembering that Davout was a duke. \u201cNo, monseigneur, you cannot have known me. I am a militia officer and have not quitted Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYour name?\u201d asked Davout.\n\n\u201cBez\u00fakhov.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat proof have I that you are not lying?\u201d\n\n\u201cMonseigneur!\u201d exclaimed Pierre, not in an offended but in a pleading voice.\n\nDavout looked up and gazed intently at him. For some seconds they looked at one another, and that look saved Pierre. Apart from conditions of war and law, that look established human relations between the two men. At that moment an immense number of things passed dimly through both their minds, and they realized that they were both children of humanity and were brothers.\n\nAt the first glance, when Davout had only raised his head from the papers where human affairs and lives were indicated by numbers, Pierre was merely a circumstance, and Davout could have shot him without burdening his conscience with an evil deed, but now he saw in him a human being. He reflected for a moment.\n\n\u201cHow can you show me that you are telling the truth?\u201d said Davout coldly.\n\nPierre remembered Ramballe, and named him and his regiment and the street where the house was.\n\n\u201cYou are not what you say,\u201d returned Davout.\n\nIn a trembling, faltering voice Pierre began adducing proofs of the truth of his statements.\n\nBut at that moment an adjutant entered and reported something to Davout.\n\nDavout brightened up at the news the adjutant brought, and began buttoning up his uniform. It seemed that he had quite forgotten Pierre.\n\nWhen the adjutant reminded him of the prisoner, he jerked his head in Pierre\u2019s direction with a frown and ordered him to be led away. But where they were to take him Pierre did not know: back to the coach house or to the place of execution his companions had pointed out to him as they crossed the Virgin\u2019s Field.\n\nHe turned his head and saw that the adjutant was putting another question to Davout.\n\n\u201cYes, of course!\u201d replied Davout, but what this \u201cyes\u201d meant, Pierre did not know.\n\nPierre could not afterwards remember how he went, whether it was far, or in which direction. His faculties were quite numbed, he was stupefied, and noticing nothing around him went on moving his legs as the others did till they all stopped and he stopped too. The only thought in his mind at that time was: who was it that had really sentenced him to death? Not the men on the commission that had first examined him\u2014not one of them wished to or, evidently, could have done it. It was not Davout, who had looked at him in so human a way. In another moment Davout would have realized that he was doing wrong, but just then the adjutant had come in and interrupted him. The adjutant, also, had evidently had no evil intent though he might have refrained from coming in. Then who was executing him, killing him, depriving him of life\u2014him, Pierre, with all his memories, aspirations, hopes, and thoughts? Who was doing this? And Pierre felt that it was no one.\n\nIt was a system\u2014a concurrence of circumstances.\n\nA system of some sort was killing him\u2014Pierre\u2014depriving him of life, of everything, annihilating him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nFrom Prince Shcherb\u00e1tov\u2019s house the prisoners were led straight down the Virgin\u2019s Field, to the left of the nunnery, as far as a kitchen garden in which a post had been set up. Beyond that post a fresh pit had been dug in the ground, and near the post and the pit a large crowd stood in a semicircle. The crowd consisted of a few Russians and many of Napoleon\u2019s soldiers who were not on duty\u2014Germans, Italians, and Frenchmen, in a variety of uniforms. To the right and left of the post stood rows of French troops in blue uniforms with red epaulets and high boots and shakos.\n\nThe prisoners were placed in a certain order, according to the list (Pierre was sixth), and were led to the post. Several drums suddenly began to beat on both sides of them, and at that sound Pierre felt as if part of his soul had been torn away. He lost the power of thinking or understanding. He could only hear and see. And he had only one wish\u2014that the frightful thing that had to happen should happen quickly. Pierre looked round at his fellow prisoners and scrutinized them.\n\nThe two first were convicts with shaven heads. One was tall and thin, the other dark, shaggy, and sinewy, with a flat nose. The third was a domestic serf, about forty-five years old, with grizzled hair and a plump, well-nourished body. The fourth was a peasant, a very handsome man with a broad, light-brown beard and black eyes. The fifth was a factory hand, a thin, sallow-faced lad of eighteen in a loose coat.\n\nPierre heard the French consulting whether to shoot them separately or two at a time. \u201cIn couples,\u201d replied the officer in command in a calm voice. There was a stir in the ranks of the soldiers and it was evident that they were all hurrying\u2014not as men hurry to do something they understand, but as people hurry to finish a necessary but unpleasant and incomprehensible task.\n\nA French official wearing a scarf came up to the right of the row of prisoners and read out the sentence in Russian and in French.\n\nThen two pairs of Frenchmen approached the criminals and at the officer\u2019s command took the two convicts who stood first in the row. The convicts stopped when they reached the post and, while sacks were being brought, looked dumbly around as a wounded beast looks at an approaching huntsman. One crossed himself continually, the other scratched his back and made a movement of the lips resembling a smile. With hurried hands the soldiers blindfolded them, drawing the sacks over their heads, and bound them to the post.\n\nTwelve sharpshooters with muskets stepped out of the ranks with a firm regular tread and halted eight paces from the post. Pierre turned away to avoid seeing what was going to happen. Suddenly a crackling, rolling noise was heard which seemed to him louder than the most terrific thunder, and he looked round. There was some smoke, and the Frenchmen were doing something near the pit, with pale faces and trembling hands. Two more prisoners were led up. In the same way and with similar looks, these two glanced vainly at the onlookers with only a silent appeal for protection in their eyes, evidently unable to understand or believe what was going to happen to them. They could not believe it because they alone knew what their life meant to them, and so they neither understood nor believed that it could be taken from them.\n\nAgain Pierre did not wish to look and again turned away; but again the sound as of a frightful explosion struck his ear, and at the same moment he saw smoke, blood, and the pale, scared faces of the Frenchmen who were again doing something by the post, their trembling hands impeding one another. Pierre, breathing heavily, looked around as if asking what it meant. The same question was expressed in all the looks that met his.\n\nOn the faces of all the Russians and of the French soldiers and officers without exception, he read the same dismay, horror, and conflict that were in his own heart. \u201cBut who, after all, is doing this? They are all suffering as I am. Who then is it? Who?\u201d flashed for an instant through his mind.\n\n\u201cSharpshooters of the 86th, forward!\u201d shouted someone. The fifth prisoner, the one next to Pierre, was led away\u2014alone. Pierre did not understand that he was saved, that he and the rest had been brought there only to witness the execution. With ever-growing horror, and no sense of joy or relief, he gazed at what was taking place. The fifth man was the factory lad in the loose cloak. The moment they laid hands on him he sprang aside in terror and clutched at Pierre. (Pierre shuddered and shook himself free.) The lad was unable to walk. They dragged him along, holding him up under the arms, and he screamed. When they got him to the post he grew quiet, as if he suddenly understood something. Whether he understood that screaming was useless or whether he thought it incredible that men should kill him, at any rate he took his stand at the post, waiting to be blindfolded like the others, and like a wounded animal looked around him with glittering eyes.\n\nPierre was no longer able to turn away and close his eyes. His curiosity and agitation, like that of the whole crowd, reached the highest pitch at this fifth murder. Like the others this fifth man seemed calm; he wrapped his loose cloak closer and rubbed one bare foot with the other.\n\nWhen they began to blindfold him he himself adjusted the knot which hurt the back of his head; then when they propped him against the bloodstained post, he leaned back and, not being comfortable in that position, straightened himself, adjusted his feet, and leaned back again more comfortably. Pierre did not take his eyes from him and did not miss his slightest movement.\n\nProbably a word of command was given and was followed by the reports of eight muskets; but try as he would Pierre could not afterwards remember having heard the slightest sound of the shots. He only saw how the workman suddenly sank down on the cords that held him, how blood showed itself in two places, how the ropes slackened under the weight of the hanging body, and how the workman sat down, his head hanging unnaturally and one leg bent under him. Pierre ran up to the post. No one hindered him. Pale, frightened people were doing something around the workman. The lower jaw of an old Frenchman with a thick mustache trembled as he untied the ropes. The body collapsed. The soldiers dragged it awkwardly from the post and began pushing it into the pit.\n\nThey all plainly and certainly knew that they were criminals who must hide the traces of their guilt as quickly as possible.\n\nPierre glanced into the pit and saw that the factory lad was lying with his knees close up to his head and one shoulder higher than the other. That shoulder rose and fell rhythmically and convulsively, but spadefuls of earth were already being thrown over the whole body. One of the soldiers, evidently suffering, shouted gruffly and angrily at Pierre to go back. But Pierre did not understand him and remained near the post, and no one drove him away.\n\nWhen the pit had been filled up a command was given. Pierre was taken back to his place, and the rows of troops on both sides of the post made a half turn and went past it at a measured pace. The twenty-four sharpshooters with discharged muskets, standing in the center of the circle, ran back to their places as the companies passed by.\n\nPierre gazed now with dazed eyes at these sharpshooters who ran in couples out of the circle. All but one rejoined their companies. This one, a young soldier, his face deadly pale, his shako pushed back, and his musket resting on the ground, still stood near the pit at the spot from which he had fired. He swayed like a drunken man, taking some steps forward and back to save himself from falling. An old, noncommissioned officer ran out of the ranks and taking him by the elbow dragged him to his company. The crowd of Russians and Frenchmen began to disperse. They all went away silently and with drooping heads.\n\n\u201cThat will teach them to start fires,\u201d said one of the Frenchmen.\n\nPierre glanced round at the speaker and saw that it was a soldier who was trying to find some relief after what had been done, but was not able to do so. Without finishing what he had begun to say he made a hopeless movement with his arm and went away.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAfter the execution Pierre was separated from the rest of the prisoners and placed alone in a small, ruined, and befouled church.\n\nToward evening a noncommissioned officer entered with two soldiers and told him that he had been pardoned and would now go to the barracks for the prisoners of war. Without understanding what was said to him, Pierre got up and went with the soldiers. They took him to the upper end of the field, where there were some sheds built of charred planks, beams, and battens, and led him into one of them. In the darkness some twenty different men surrounded Pierre. He looked at them without understanding who they were, why they were there, or what they wanted of him. He heard what they said, but did not understand the meaning of the words and made no kind of deduction from or application of them. He replied to questions they put to him, but did not consider who was listening to his replies, nor how they would understand them. He looked at their faces and figures, but they all seemed to him equally meaningless.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had witnessed those terrible murders committed by men who did not wish to commit them, it was as if the mainspring of his life, on which everything depended and which made everything appear alive, had suddenly been wrenched out and everything had collapsed into a heap of meaningless rubbish. Though he did not acknowledge it to himself, his faith in the right ordering of the universe, in humanity, in his own soul, and in God, had been destroyed. He had experienced this before, but never so strongly as now. When similar doubts had assailed him before, they had been the result of his own wrongdoing, and at the bottom of his heart he had felt that relief from his despair and from those doubts was to be found within himself. But now he felt that the universe had crumbled before his eyes and only meaningless ruins remained, and this not by any fault of his own. He felt that it was not in his power to regain faith in the meaning of life.\n\nAround him in the darkness men were standing and evidently something about him interested them greatly. They were telling him something and asking him something. Then they led him away somewhere, and at last he found himself in a corner of the shed among men who were laughing and talking on all sides.\n\n\u201cWell, then, mates... that very prince who...\u201d some voice at the other end of the shed was saying, with a strong emphasis on the word who.\n\nSitting silent and motionless on a heap of straw against the wall, Pierre sometimes opened and sometimes closed his eyes. But as soon as he closed them he saw before him the dreadful face of the factory lad\u2014especially dreadful because of its simplicity\u2014and the faces of the murderers, even more dreadful because of their disquiet. And he opened his eyes again and stared vacantly into the darkness around him.\n\nBeside him in a stooping position sat a small man of whose presence he was first made aware by a strong smell of perspiration which came from him every time he moved. This man was doing something to his legs in the darkness, and though Pierre could not see his face he felt that the man continually glanced at him. On growing used to the darkness Pierre saw that the man was taking off his leg bands, and the way he did it aroused Pierre\u2019s interest.\n\nHaving unwound the string that tied the band on one leg, he carefully coiled it up and immediately set to work on the other leg, glancing up at Pierre. While one hand hung up the first string the other was already unwinding the band on the second leg. In this way, having carefully removed the leg bands by deft circular motions of his arm following one another uninterruptedly, the man hung the leg bands up on some pegs fixed above his head. Then he took out a knife, cut something, closed the knife, placed it under the head of his bed, and, seating himself comfortably, clasped his arms round his lifted knees and fixed his eyes on Pierre. The latter was conscious of something pleasant, comforting, and well-rounded in these deft movements, in the man\u2019s well-ordered arrangements in his corner, and even in his very smell, and he looked at the man without taking his eyes from him.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve seen a lot of trouble, sir, eh?\u201d the little man suddenly said.\n\nAnd there was so much kindliness and simplicity in his singsong voice that Pierre tried to reply, but his jaw trembled and he felt tears rising to his eyes. The little fellow, giving Pierre no time to betray his confusion, instantly continued in the same pleasant tones:\n\n\u201cEh, lad, don\u2019t fret!\u201d said he, in the tender singsong caressing voice old Russian peasant women employ. \u201cDon\u2019t fret, friend\u2014\u2018suffer an hour, live for an age!\u2019 that\u2019s how it is, my dear fellow. And here we live, thank heaven, without offense. Among these folk, too, there are good men as well as bad,\u201d said he, and still speaking, he turned on his knees with a supple movement, got up, coughed, and went off to another part of the shed.\n\n\u201cEh, you rascal!\u201d Pierre heard the same kind voice saying at the other end of the shed. \u201cSo you\u2019ve come, you rascal? She remembers... Now, now, that\u2019ll do!\u201d\n\nAnd the soldier, pushing away a little dog that was jumping up at him, returned to his place and sat down. In his hands he had something wrapped in a rag.\n\n\u201cHere, eat a bit, sir,\u201d said he, resuming his former respectful tone as he unwrapped and offered Pierre some baked potatoes. \u201cWe had soup for dinner and the potatoes are grand!\u201d\n\nPierre had not eaten all day and the smell of the potatoes seemed extremely pleasant to him. He thanked the soldier and began to eat.\n\n\u201cWell, are they all right?\u201d said the soldier with a smile. \u201cYou should do like this.\u201d\n\nHe took a potato, drew out his clasp knife, cut the potato into two equal halves on the palm of his hand, sprinkled some salt on it from the rag, and handed it to Pierre.\n\n\u201cThe potatoes are grand!\u201d he said once more. \u201cEat some like that!\u201d\n\nPierre thought he had never eaten anything that tasted better.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019m all right,\u201d said he, \u201cbut why did they shoot those poor fellows? The last one was hardly twenty.\u201d\n\n\u201cTss, tt...!\u201d said the little man. \u201cAh, what a sin... what a sin!\u201d he added quickly, and as if his words were always waiting ready in his mouth and flew out involuntarily he went on: \u201cHow was it, sir, that you stayed in Moscow?\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they would come so soon. I stayed accidentally,\u201d replied Pierre.\n\n\u201cAnd how did they arrest you, dear lad? At your house?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I went to look at the fire, and they arrested me there, and tried me as an incendiary.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhere there\u2019s law there\u2019s injustice,\u201d put in the little man.\n\n\u201cAnd have you been here long?\u201d Pierre asked as he munched the last of the potato.\n\n\u201cI? It was last Sunday they took me, out of a hospital in Moscow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, are you a soldier then?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, we are soldiers of the \u00c1psheron regiment. I was dying of fever. We weren\u2019t told anything. There were some twenty of us lying there. We had no idea, never guessed at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you feel sad here?\u201d Pierre inquired.\n\n\u201cHow can one help it, lad? My name is Plat\u00f3n, and the surname is Karat\u00e1ev,\u201d he added, evidently wishing to make it easier for Pierre to address him. \u201cThey call me \u2018little falcon\u2019 in the regiment. How is one to help feeling sad? Moscow\u2014she\u2019s the mother of cities. How can one see all this and not feel sad? But \u2018the maggot gnaws the cabbage, yet dies first\u2019; that\u2019s what the old folks used to tell us,\u201d he added rapidly.\n\n\u201cWhat? What did you say?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cWho? I?\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev. \u201cI say things happen not as we plan but as God judges,\u201d he replied, thinking that he was repeating what he had said before, and immediately continued:\n\n\u201cWell, and you, have you a family estate, sir? And a house? So you have abundance, then? And a housewife? And your old parents, are they still living?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd though it was too dark for Pierre to see, he felt that a suppressed smile of kindliness puckered the soldier\u2019s lips as he put these questions. He seemed grieved that Pierre had no parents, especially that he had no mother.\n\n\u201cA wife for counsel, a mother-in-law for welcome, but there\u2019s none as dear as one\u2019s own mother!\u201d said he. \u201cWell, and have you little ones?\u201d he went on asking.\n\nAgain Pierre\u2019s negative answer seemed to distress him, and he hastened to add:\n\n\u201cNever mind! You\u2019re young folks yet, and please God may still have some. The great thing is to live in harmony....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s all the same now,\u201d Pierre could not help saying.\n\n\u201cAh, my dear fellow!\u201d rejoined Karat\u00e1ev, \u201cnever decline a prison or a beggar\u2019s sack!\u201d\n\nHe seated himself more comfortably and coughed, evidently preparing to tell a long story.\n\n\u201cWell, my dear fellow, I was still living at home,\u201d he began. \u201cWe had a well-to-do homestead, plenty of land, we peasants lived well and our house was one to thank God for. When Father and we went out mowing there were seven of us. We lived well. We were real peasants. It so happened...\u201d\n\nAnd Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev told a long story of how he had gone into someone\u2019s copse to take wood, how he had been caught by the keeper, had been tried, flogged, and sent to serve as a soldier.\n\n\u201cWell, lad,\u201d and a smile changed the tone of his voice, \u201cwe thought it was a misfortune but it turned out a blessing! If it had not been for my sin, my brother would have had to go as a soldier. But he, my younger brother, had five little ones, while I, you see, only left a wife behind. We had a little girl, but God took her before I went as a soldier. I come home on leave and I\u2019ll tell you how it was, I look and see that they are living better than before. The yard full of cattle, the women at home, two brothers away earning wages, and only Michael the youngest, at home. Father, he says, \u2018All my children are the same to me: it hurts the same whichever finger gets bitten. But if Plat\u00f3n hadn\u2019t been shaved for a soldier, Michael would have had to go.\u2019 called us all to him and, will you believe it, placed us in front of the icons. \u2018Michael,\u2019 he says, \u2018come here and bow down to his feet; and you, young woman, you bow down too; and you, grandchildren, also bow down before him! Do you understand?\u2019 he says. That\u2019s how it is, dear fellow. Fate looks for a head. But we are always judging, \u2018that\u2019s not well\u2014that\u2019s not right!\u2019 Our luck is like water in a dragnet: you pull at it and it bulges, but when you\u2019ve drawn it out it\u2019s empty! That\u2019s how it is.\u201d\n\nAnd Plat\u00f3n shifted his seat on the straw.\n\nAfter a short silence he rose.\n\n\u201cWell, I think you must be sleepy,\u201d said he, and began rapidly crossing himself and repeating:\n\n\u201cLord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, holy Saint Nicholas, Frola and Lavra! Lord Jesus Christ, have mercy on us and save us!\u201d he concluded, then bowed to the ground, got up, sighed, and sat down again on his heap of straw. \u201cThat\u2019s the way. Lay me down like a stone, O God, and raise me up like a loaf,\u201d he muttered as he lay down, pulling his coat over him.\n\n\u201cWhat prayer was that you were saying?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cEh?\u201d murmured Plat\u00f3n, who had almost fallen asleep. \u201cWhat was I saying? I was praying. Don\u2019t you pray?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I do,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cBut what was that you said: Frola and Lavra?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, of course,\u201d replied Plat\u00f3n quickly, \u201cthe horses\u2019 saints. One must pity the animals too. Eh, the rascal! Now you\u2019ve curled up and got warm, you daughter of a bitch!\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev, touching the dog that lay at his feet, and again turning over he fell asleep immediately.\n\nSounds of crying and screaming came from somewhere in the distance outside, and flames were visible through the cracks of the shed, but inside it was quiet and dark. For a long time Pierre did not sleep, but lay with eyes open in the darkness, listening to the regular snoring of Plat\u00f3n who lay beside him, and he felt that the world that had been shattered was once more stirring in his soul with a new beauty and on new and unshakable foundations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nTwenty-three soldiers, three officers, and two officials were confined in the shed in which Pierre had been placed and where he remained for four weeks.\n\nWhen Pierre remembered them afterwards they all seemed misty figures to him except Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev, who always remained in his mind a most vivid and precious memory and the personification of everything Russian, kindly, and round. When Pierre saw his neighbor next morning at dawn the first impression of him, as of something round, was fully confirmed: Plat\u00f3n\u2019s whole figure\u2014in a French overcoat girdled with a cord, a soldier\u2019s cap, and bast shoes\u2014was round. His head was quite round, his back, chest, shoulders, and even his arms, which he held as if ever ready to embrace something, were rounded, his pleasant smile and his large, gentle brown eyes were also round.\n\nPlat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev must have been fifty, judging by his stories of campaigns he had been in, told as by an old soldier. He did not himself know his age and was quite unable to determine it. But his brilliantly white, strong teeth which showed in two unbroken semicircles when he laughed\u2014as he often did\u2014were all sound and good, there was not a gray hair in his beard or on his head, and his whole body gave an impression of suppleness and especially of firmness and endurance.\n\nHis face, despite its fine, rounded wrinkles, had an expression of innocence and youth, his voice was pleasant and musical. But the chief peculiarity of his speech was its directness and appositeness. It was evident that he never considered what he had said or was going to say, and consequently the rapidity and justice of his intonation had an irresistible persuasiveness.\n\nHis physical strength and agility during the first days of his imprisonment were such that he seemed not to know what fatigue and sickness meant. Every night before lying down, he said: \u201cLord, lay me down as a stone and raise me up as a loaf!\u201d and every morning on getting up, he said: \u201cI lay down and curled up, I get up and shake myself.\u201d And indeed he only had to lie down, to fall asleep like a stone, and he only had to shake himself, to be ready without a moment\u2019s delay for some work, just as children are ready to play directly they awake. He could do everything, not very well but not badly. He baked, cooked, sewed, planed, and mended boots. He was always busy, and only at night allowed himself conversation\u2014of which he was fond\u2014and songs. He did not sing like a trained singer who knows he is listened to, but like the birds, evidently giving vent to the sounds in the same way that one stretches oneself or walks about to get rid of stiffness, and the sounds were always high-pitched, mournful, delicate, and almost feminine, and his face at such times was very serious.\n\nHaving been taken prisoner and allowed his beard to grow, he seemed to have thrown off all that had been forced upon him\u2014everything military and alien to himself\u2014and had returned to his former peasant habits.\n\n\u201cA soldier on leave\u2014a shirt outside breeches,\u201d he would say.\n\nHe did not like talking about his life as a soldier, though he did not complain, and often mentioned that he had not been flogged once during the whole of his army service. When he related anything it was generally some old and evidently precious memory of his \u201cChristian\u201d life, as he called his peasant existence. The proverbs, of which his talk was full, were for the most part not the coarse and indecent saws soldiers employ, but those folk sayings which taken without a context seem so insignificant, but when used appositely suddenly acquire a significance of profound wisdom.\n\nHe would often say the exact opposite of what he had said on a previous occasion, yet both would be right. He liked to talk and he talked well, adorning his speech with terms of endearment and with folk sayings which Pierre thought he invented himself, but the chief charm of his talk lay in the fact that the commonest events\u2014sometimes just such as Pierre had witnessed without taking notice of them\u2014assumed in Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s a character of solemn fitness. He liked to hear the folk tales one of the soldiers used to tell of an evening (they were always the same), but most of all he liked to hear stories of real life. He would smile joyfully when listening to such stories, now and then putting in a word or asking a question to make the moral beauty of what he was told clear to himself. Karat\u00e1ev had no attachments, friendships, or love, as Pierre understood them, but loved and lived affectionately with everything life brought him in contact with, particularly with man\u2014not any particular man, but those with whom he happened to be. He loved his dog, his comrades, the French, and Pierre who was his neighbor, but Pierre felt that in spite of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s affectionate tenderness for him (by which he unconsciously gave Pierre\u2019s spiritual life its due) he would not have grieved for a moment at parting from him. And Pierre began to feel in the same way toward Karat\u00e1ev.\n\nTo all the other prisoners Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev seemed a most ordinary soldier. They called him \u201clittle falcon\u201d or \u201cPlat\u00f3sha,\u201d chaffed him good-naturedly, and sent him on errands. But to Pierre he always remained what he had seemed that first night: an unfathomable, rounded, eternal personification of the spirit of simplicity and truth.\n\nPlat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev knew nothing by heart except his prayers. When he began to speak he seemed not to know how he would conclude.\n\nSometimes Pierre, struck by the meaning of his words, would ask him to repeat them, but Plat\u00f3n could never recall what he had said a moment before, just as he never could repeat to Pierre the words of his favorite song: native and birch tree and my heart is sick occurred in it, but when spoken and not sung, no meaning could be got out of it. He did not, and could not, understand the meaning of words apart from their context. Every word and action of his was the manifestation of an activity unknown to him, which was his life. But his life, as he regarded it, had no meaning as a separate thing. It had meaning only as part of a whole of which he was always conscious. His words and actions flowed from him as evenly, inevitably, and spontaneously as fragrance exhales from a flower. He could not understand the value or significance of any word or deed taken separately.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nWhen Princess Mary heard from Nicholas that her brother was with the Rost\u00f3vs at Yarosl\u00e1vl she at once prepared to go there, in spite of her aunt\u2019s efforts to dissuade her\u2014and not merely to go herself but to take her nephew with her. Whether it were difficult or easy, possible or impossible, she did not ask and did not want to know: it was her duty, not only to herself, to be near her brother who was perhaps dying, but to do everything possible to take his son to him, and so she prepared to set off. That she had not heard from Prince Andrew himself, Princess Mary attributed to his being too weak to write or to his considering the long journey too hard and too dangerous for her and his son.\n\nIn a few days Princess Mary was ready to start. Her equipages were the huge family coach in which she had traveled to Vor\u00f3nezh, a semiopen trap, and a baggage cart. With her traveled Mademoiselle Bourienne, little Nicholas and his tutor, her old nurse, three maids, T\u00edkhon, and a young footman and courier her aunt had sent to accompany her.\n\nThe usual route through Moscow could not be thought of, and the roundabout way Princess Mary was obliged to take through L\u00edpetsk, Ryaz\u00e1n, Vlad\u00edmir, and Sh\u00faya was very long and, as post horses were not everywhere obtainable, very difficult, and near Ryaz\u00e1n where the French were said to have shown themselves was even dangerous.\n\nDuring this difficult journey Mademoiselle Bourienne, Dessalles, and Princess Mary\u2019s servants were astonished at her energy and firmness of spirit. She went to bed later and rose earlier than any of them, and no difficulties daunted her. Thanks to her activity and energy, which infected her fellow travelers, they approached Yarosl\u00e1vl by the end of the second week.\n\nThe last days of her stay in Vor\u00f3nezh had been the happiest of her life. Her love for Rost\u00f3v no longer tormented or agitated her. It filled her whole soul, had become an integral part of herself, and she no longer struggled against it. Latterly she had become convinced that she loved and was beloved, though she never said this definitely to herself in words. She had become convinced of it at her last interview with Nicholas, when he had come to tell her that her brother was with the Rost\u00f3vs. Not by a single word had Nicholas alluded to the fact that Prince Andrew\u2019s relations with Nat\u00e1sha might, if he recovered, be renewed, but Princess Mary saw by his face that he knew and thought of this.\n\nYet in spite of that, his relation to her\u2014considerate, delicate, and loving\u2014not only remained unchanged, but it sometimes seemed to Princess Mary that he was even glad that the family connection between them allowed him to express his friendship more freely. She knew that she loved for the first and only time in her life and felt that she was beloved, and was happy in regard to it.\n\nBut this happiness on one side of her spiritual nature did not prevent her feeling grief for her brother with full force; on the contrary, that spiritual tranquility on the one side made it the more possible for her to give full play to her feeling for her brother. That feeling was so strong at the moment of leaving Vor\u00f3nezh that those who saw her off, as they looked at her careworn, despairing face, felt sure she would fall ill on the journey. But the very difficulties and preoccupations of the journey, which she took so actively in hand, saved her for a while from her grief and gave her strength.\n\nAs always happens when traveling, Princess Mary thought only of the journey itself, forgetting its object. But as she approached Yarosl\u00e1vl the thought of what might await her there\u2014not after many days, but that very evening\u2014again presented itself to her and her agitation increased to its utmost limit.\n\nThe courier who had been sent on in advance to find out where the Rost\u00f3vs were staying in Yarosl\u00e1vl, and in what condition Prince Andrew was, when he met the big coach just entering the town gates was appalled by the terrible pallor of the princess\u2019 face that looked out at him from the window.\n\n\u201cI have found out everything, your excellency: the Rost\u00f3vs are staying at the merchant Br\u00f3nnikov\u2019s house, in the Square not far from here, right above the V\u00f3lga,\u201d said the courier.\n\nPrincess Mary looked at him with frightened inquiry, not understanding why he did not reply to what she chiefly wanted to know: how was her brother? Mademoiselle Bourienne put that question for her.\n\n\u201cHow is the prince?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cHis excellency is staying in the same house with them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThen he is alive,\u201d thought Princess Mary, and asked in a low voice: \u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe servants say he is still the same.\u201d\n\nWhat \u201cstill the same\u201d might mean Princess Mary did not ask, but with an unnoticed glance at little seven-year-old Nicholas, who was sitting in front of her looking with pleasure at the town, she bowed her head and did not raise it again till the heavy coach, rumbling, shaking and swaying, came to a stop. The carriage steps clattered as they were let down.\n\nThe carriage door was opened. On the left there was water\u2014a great river\u2014and on the right a porch. There were people at the entrance: servants, and a rosy girl with a large plait of black hair, smiling as it seemed to Princess Mary in an unpleasantly affected way. (This was S\u00f3nya.) Princess Mary ran up the steps. \u201cThis way, this way!\u201d said the girl, with the same artificial smile, and the princess found herself in the hall facing an elderly woman of Oriental type, who came rapidly to meet her with a look of emotion. This was the countess. She embraced Princess Mary and kissed her.\n\n\u201cMon enfant!\u201d she muttered, \u201cje vous aime et vous connais depuis longtemps.\u201d\n\nDespite her excitement, Princess Mary realized that this was the countess and that it was necessary to say something to her. Hardly knowing how she did it, she contrived to utter a few polite phrases in French in the same tone as those that had been addressed to her, and asked: \u201cHow is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe doctor says that he is not in danger,\u201d said the countess, but as she spoke she raised her eyes with a sigh, and her gesture conveyed a contradiction of her words.\n\n\u201cWhere is he? Can I see him\u2014can I?\u201d asked the princess.\n\n\u201cOne moment, Princess, one moment, my dear! Is this his son?\u201d said the countess, turning to little Nicholas who was coming in with Dessalles. \u201cThere will be room for everybody, this is a big house. Oh, what a lovely boy!\u201d\n\nThe countess took Princess Mary into the drawing room, where S\u00f3nya was talking to Mademoiselle Bourienne. The countess caressed the boy, and the old count came in and welcomed the princess. He had changed very much since Princess Mary had last seen him. Then he had been a brisk, cheerful, self-assured old man; now he seemed a pitiful, bewildered person. While talking to Princess Mary he continually looked round as if asking everyone whether he was doing the right thing. After the destruction of Moscow and of his property, thrown out of his accustomed groove he seemed to have lost the sense of his own significance and to feel that there was no longer a place for him in life.\n\nIn spite of her one desire to see her brother as soon as possible, and her vexation that at the moment when all she wanted was to see him they should be trying to entertain her and pretending to admire her nephew, the princess noticed all that was going on around her and felt the necessity of submitting, for a time, to this new order of things which she had entered. She knew it to be necessary, and though it was hard for her she was not vexed with these people.\n\n\u201cThis is my niece,\u201d said the count, introducing S\u00f3nya\u2014\u201cYou don\u2019t know her, Princess?\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary turned to S\u00f3nya and, trying to stifle the hostile feeling that arose in her toward the girl, she kissed her. But she felt oppressed by the fact that the mood of everyone around her was so far from what was in her own heart.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d she asked again, addressing them all.\n\n\u201cHe is downstairs. Nat\u00e1sha is with him,\u201d answered S\u00f3nya, flushing. \u201cWe have sent to ask. I think you must be tired, Princess.\u201d\n\nTears of vexation showed themselves in Princess Mary\u2019s eyes. She turned away and was about to ask the countess again how to go to him, when light, impetuous, and seemingly buoyant steps were heard at the door. The princess looked round and saw Nat\u00e1sha coming in, almost running\u2014that Nat\u00e1sha whom she had liked so little at their meeting in Moscow long since.\n\nBut hardly had the princess looked at Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face before she realized that here was a real comrade in her grief, and consequently a friend. She ran to meet her, embraced her, and began to cry on her shoulder.\n\nAs soon as Nat\u00e1sha, sitting at the head of Prince Andrew\u2019s bed, heard of Princess Mary\u2019s arrival, she softly left his room and hastened to her with those swift steps that had sounded buoyant to Princess Mary.\n\nThere was only one expression on her agitated face when she ran into the drawing room\u2014that of love\u2014boundless love for him, for her, and for all that was near to the man she loved; and of pity, suffering for others, and passionate desire to give herself entirely to helping them. It was plain that at that moment there was in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s heart no thought of herself or of her own relations with Prince Andrew.\n\nPrincess Mary, with her acute sensibility, understood all this at the first glance at Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face, and wept on her shoulder with sorrowful pleasure.\n\n\u201cCome, come to him, Mary,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, leading her into the other room.\n\nPrincess Mary raised her head, dried her eyes, and turned to Nat\u00e1sha. She felt that from her she would be able to understand and learn everything.\n\n\u201cHow...\u201d she began her question but stopped short.\n\nShe felt that it was impossible to ask, or to answer, in words. Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face and eyes would have to tell her all more clearly and profoundly.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was gazing at her, but seemed afraid and in doubt whether to say all she knew or not; she seemed to feel that before those luminous eyes which penetrated into the very depths of her heart, it was impossible not to tell the whole truth which she saw. And suddenly, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s lips twitched, ugly wrinkles gathered round her mouth, and covering her face with her hands she burst into sobs.\n\nPrincess Mary understood.\n\nBut she still hoped, and asked, in words she herself did not trust:\n\n\u201cBut how is his wound? What is his general condition?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou, you... will see,\u201d was all Nat\u00e1sha could say.\n\nThey sat a little while downstairs near his room till they had left off crying and were able to go to him with calm faces.\n\n\u201cHow has his whole illness gone? Is it long since he grew worse? When did this happen?\u201d Princess Mary inquired.\n\nNat\u00e1sha told her that at first there had been danger from his feverish condition and the pain he suffered, but at Tr\u00f3itsa that had passed and the doctor had only been afraid of gangrene. That danger had also passed. When they reached Yarosl\u00e1vl the wound had begun to fester (Nat\u00e1sha knew all about such things as festering) and the doctor had said that the festering might take a normal course. Then fever set in, but the doctor had said the fever was not very serious.\n\n\u201cBut two days ago this suddenly happened,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, struggling with her sobs. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but you will see what he is like.\u201d\n\n\u201cIs he weaker? Thinner?\u201d asked the princess.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that, but worse. You will see. O, Mary, he is too good, he cannot, cannot live, because...\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nWhen Nat\u00e1sha opened Prince Andrew\u2019s door with a familiar movement and let Princess Mary pass into the room before her, the princess felt the sobs in her throat. Hard as she had tried to prepare herself, and now tried to remain tranquil, she knew that she would be unable to look at him without tears.\n\nThe princess understood what Nat\u00e1sha had meant by the words: \u201ctwo days ago this suddenly happened.\u201d She understood those words to mean that he had suddenly softened and that this softening and gentleness were signs of approaching death. As she stepped to the door she already saw in imagination Andrew\u2019s face as she remembered it in childhood, a gentle, mild, sympathetic face which he had rarely shown, and which therefore affected her very strongly. She was sure he would speak soft, tender words to her such as her father had uttered before his death, and that she would not be able to bear it and would burst into sobs in his presence. Yet sooner or later it had to be, and she went in. The sobs rose higher and higher in her throat as she more and more clearly distinguished his form and her shortsighted eyes tried to make out his features, and then she saw his face and met his gaze.\n\nHe was lying in a squirrel-fur dressing gown on a divan, surrounded by pillows. He was thin and pale. In one thin, translucently white hand he held a handkerchief, while with the other he stroked the delicate mustache he had grown, moving his fingers slowly. His eyes gazed at them as they entered.\n\nOn seeing his face and meeting his eyes Princess Mary\u2019s pace suddenly slackened, she felt her tears dry up and her sobs ceased. She suddenly felt guilty and grew timid on catching the expression of his face and eyes.\n\n\u201cBut in what am I to blame?\u201d she asked herself. And his cold, stern look replied: \u201cBecause you are alive and thinking of the living, while I...\u201d\n\nIn the deep gaze that seemed to look not outwards but inwards there was an almost hostile expression as he slowly regarded his sister and Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nHe kissed his sister, holding her hand in his as was their wont.\n\n\u201cHow are you, Mary? How did you manage to get here?\u201d said he in a voice as calm and aloof as his look.\n\nHad he screamed in agony, that scream would not have struck such horror into Princess Mary\u2019s heart as the tone of his voice.\n\n\u201cAnd have you brought little Nicholas?\u201d he asked in the same slow, quiet manner and with an obvious effort to remember.\n\n\u201cHow are you now?\u201d said Princess Mary, herself surprised at what she was saying.\n\n\u201cThat, my dear, you must ask the doctor,\u201d he replied, and again making an evident effort to be affectionate, he said with his lips only (his words clearly did not correspond to his thoughts):\n\n\u201cMerci, ch\u00e8re amie, d\u2019\u00eatre venue.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary pressed his hand. The pressure made him wince just perceptibly. He was silent, and she did not know what to say. She now understood what had happened to him two days before. In his words, his tone, and especially in that calm, almost antagonistic look could be felt an estrangement from everything belonging to this world, terrible in one who is alive. Evidently only with an effort did he understand anything living; but it was obvious that he failed to understand, not because he lacked the power to do so but because he understood something else\u2014something the living did not and could not understand\u2014and which wholly occupied his mind.\n\n\u201cThere, you see how strangely fate has brought us together,\u201d said he, breaking the silence and pointing to Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cShe looks after me all the time.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary heard him and did not understand how he could say such a thing. He, the sensitive, tender Prince Andrew, how could he say that, before her whom he loved and who loved him? Had he expected to live he could not have said those words in that offensively cold tone. If he had not known that he was dying, how could he have failed to pity her and how could he speak like that in her presence? The only explanation was that he was indifferent, because something else, much more important, had been revealed to him.\n\nThe conversation was cold and disconnected and continually broke off.\n\n\u201cMary came by way of Ryaz\u00e1n,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nPrince Andrew did not notice that she called his sister Mary, and only after calling her so in his presence did Nat\u00e1sha notice it herself.\n\n\u201cReally?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cThey told her that all Moscow has been burned down, and that...\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha stopped. It was impossible to talk. It was plain that he was making an effort to listen, but could not do so.\n\n\u201cYes, they say it\u2019s burned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great pity,\u201d and he gazed straight before him, absently stroking his mustache with his fingers.\n\n\u201cAnd so you have met Count Nicholas, Mary?\u201d Prince Andrew suddenly said, evidently wishing to speak pleasantly to them. \u201cHe wrote here that he took a great liking to you,\u201d he went on simply and calmly, evidently unable to understand all the complex significance his words had for living people. \u201cIf you liked him too, it would be a good thing for you to get married,\u201d he added rather more quickly, as if pleased at having found words he had long been seeking.\n\nPrincess Mary heard his words but they had no meaning for her, except as a proof of how far away he now was from everything living.\n\n\u201cWhy talk of me?\u201d she said quietly and glanced at Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, who felt her glance, did not look at her. All three were again silent.\n\n\u201cAndrew, would you like...\u201d Princess Mary suddenly said in a trembling voice, \u201cwould you like to see little Nicholas? He is always talking about you!\u201d\n\nPrince Andrew smiled just perceptibly and for the first time, but Princess Mary, who knew his face so well, saw with horror that he did not smile with pleasure or affection for his son, but with quiet, gentle irony because he thought she was trying what she believed to be the last means of arousing him.\n\n\u201cYes, I shall be very glad to see him. Is he quite well?\u201d\n\nWhen little Nicholas was brought into Prince Andrew\u2019s room he looked at his father with frightened eyes, but did not cry, because no one else was crying. Prince Andrew kissed him and evidently did not know what to say to him.\n\nWhen Nicholas had been led away, Princess Mary again went up to her brother, kissed him, and unable to restrain her tears any longer began to cry.\n\nHe looked at her attentively.\n\n\u201cIs it about Nicholas?\u201d he asked.\n\nPrincess Mary nodded her head, weeping.\n\n\u201cMary, you know the Gosp...\u201d but he broke off.\n\n\u201cWhat did you say?\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing. You mustn\u2019t cry here,\u201d he said, looking at her with the same cold expression.\n\n\nWhen Princess Mary began to cry, he understood that she was crying at the thought that little Nicholas would be left without a father. With a great effort he tried to return to life and to see things from their point of view.\n\n\u201cYes, to them it must seem sad!\u201d he thought. \u201cBut how simple it is.\n\n\u201cThe fowls of the air sow not, neither do they reap, yet your Father feedeth them,\u201d he said to himself and wished to say to Princess Mary; \u201cbut no, they will take it their own way, they won\u2019t understand! They can\u2019t understand that all those feelings they prize so\u2014all our feelings, all those ideas that seem so important to us, are unnecessary. We cannot understand one another,\u201d and he remained silent.\n\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s little son was seven. He could scarcely read, and knew nothing. After that day he lived through many things, gaining knowledge, observation, and experience, but had he possessed all the faculties he afterwards acquired, he could not have had a better or more profound understanding of the meaning of the scene he had witnessed between his father, Mary, and Nat\u00e1sha, than he had then. He understood it completely, and, leaving the room without crying, went silently up to Nat\u00e1sha who had come out with him and looked shyly at her with his beautiful, thoughtful eyes, then his uplifted, rosy upper lip trembled and leaning his head against her he began to cry.\n\nAfter that he avoided Dessalles and the countess who caressed him and either sat alone or came timidly to Princess Mary, or to Nat\u00e1sha of whom he seemed even fonder than of his aunt, and clung to them quietly and shyly.\n\nWhen Princess Mary had left Prince Andrew she fully understood what Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face had told her. She did not speak any more to Nat\u00e1sha of hopes of saving his life. She took turns with her beside his sofa, and did not cry any more, but prayed continually, turning in soul to that Eternal and Unfathomable, whose presence above the dying man was now so evident.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nNot only did Prince Andrew know he would die, but he felt that he was dying and was already half dead. He was conscious of an aloofness from everything earthly and a strange and joyous lightness of existence. Without haste or agitation he awaited what was coming. That inexorable, eternal, distant, and unknown the presence of which he had felt continually all his life\u2014was now near to him and, by the strange lightness he experienced, almost comprehensible and palpable....\n\n\nFormerly he had feared the end. He had twice experienced that terribly tormenting fear of death\u2014the end\u2014but now he no longer understood that fear.\n\nHe had felt it for the first time when the shell spun like a top before him, and he looked at the fallow field, the bushes, and the sky, and knew that he was face to face with death. When he came to himself after being wounded and the flower of eternal, unfettered love had instantly unfolded itself in his soul as if freed from the bondage of life that had restrained it, he no longer feared death and ceased to think about it.\n\nDuring the hours of solitude, suffering, and partial delirium he spent after he was wounded, the more deeply he penetrated into the new principle of eternal love revealed to him, the more he unconsciously detached himself from earthly life. To love everything and everybody and always to sacrifice oneself for love meant not to love anyone, not to live this earthly life. And the more imbued he became with that principle of love, the more he renounced life and the more completely he destroyed that dreadful barrier which\u2014in the absence of such love\u2014stands between life and death. When during those first days he remembered that he would have to die, he said to himself: \u201cWell, what of it? So much the better!\u201d\n\nBut after the night in Myt\u00edshchi when, half delirious, he had seen her for whom he longed appear before him and, having pressed her hand to his lips, had shed gentle, happy tears, love for a particular woman again crept unobserved into his heart and once more bound him to life. And joyful and agitating thoughts began to occupy his mind. Recalling the moment at the ambulance station when he had seen Kur\u00e1gin, he could not now regain the feeling he then had, but was tormented by the question whether Kur\u00e1gin was alive. And he dared not inquire.\n\nHis illness pursued its normal physical course, but what Nat\u00e1sha referred to when she said: \u201cThis suddenly happened,\u201d had occurred two days before Princess Mary arrived. It was the last spiritual struggle between life and death, in which death gained the victory. It was the unexpected realization of the fact that he still valued life as presented to him in the form of his love for Nat\u00e1sha, and a last, though ultimately vanquished, attack of terror before the unknown.\n\nIt was evening. As usual after dinner he was slightly feverish, and his thoughts were preternaturally clear. S\u00f3nya was sitting by the table. He began to doze. Suddenly a feeling of happiness seized him.\n\n\u201cAh, she has come!\u201d thought he.\n\nAnd so it was: in S\u00f3nya\u2019s place sat Nat\u00e1sha who had just come in noiselessly.\n\nSince she had begun looking after him, he had always experienced this physical consciousness of her nearness. She was sitting in an armchair placed sideways, screening the light of the candle from him, and was knitting a stocking. She had learned to knit stockings since Prince Andrew had casually mentioned that no one nursed the sick so well as old nurses who knit stockings, and that there is something soothing in the knitting of stockings. The needles clicked lightly in her slender, rapidly moving hands, and he could clearly see the thoughtful profile of her drooping face. She moved, and the ball rolled off her knees. She started, glanced round at him, and screening the candle with her hand stooped carefully with a supple and exact movement, picked up the ball, and regained her former position.\n\nHe looked at her without moving and saw that she wanted to draw a deep breath after stooping, but refrained from doing so and breathed cautiously.\n\nAt the Tr\u00f3itsa monastery they had spoken of the past, and he had told her that if he lived he would always thank God for his wound which had brought them together again, but after that they never spoke of the future.\n\n\u201cCan it or can it not be?\u201d he now thought as he looked at her and listened to the light click of the steel needles. \u201cCan fate have brought me to her so strangely only for me to die?... Is it possible that the truth of life has been revealed to me only to show me that I have spent my life in falsity? I love her more than anything in the world! But what am I to do if I love her?\u201d he thought, and he involuntarily groaned, from a habit acquired during his sufferings.\n\nOn hearing that sound Nat\u00e1sha put down the stocking, leaned nearer to him, and suddenly, noticing his shining eyes, stepped lightly up to him and bent over him.\n\n\u201cYou are not asleep?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I have been looking at you a long time. I felt you come in. No one else gives me that sense of soft tranquillity that you do... that light. I want to weep for joy.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha drew closer to him. Her face shone with rapturous joy.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, I love you too much! More than anything in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I!\u201d\u2014She turned away for an instant. \u201cWhy too much?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cWhy too much?... Well, what do you, what do you feel in your soul, your whole soul\u2014shall I live? What do you think?\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure of it, sure!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha almost shouted, taking hold of both his hands with a passionate movement.\n\nHe remained silent awhile.\n\n\u201cHow good it would be!\u201d and taking her hand he kissed it.\n\nNat\u00e1sha felt happy and agitated, but at once remembered that this would not do and that he had to be quiet.\n\n\u201cBut you have not slept,\u201d she said, repressing her joy. \u201cTry to sleep... please!\u201d\n\nHe pressed her hand and released it, and she went back to the candle and sat down again in her former position. Twice she turned and looked at him, and her eyes met his beaming at her. She set herself a task on her stocking and resolved not to turn round till it was finished.\n\nSoon he really shut his eyes and fell asleep. He did not sleep long and suddenly awoke with a start and in a cold perspiration.\n\nAs he fell asleep he had still been thinking of the subject that now always occupied his mind\u2014about life and death, and chiefly about death. He felt himself nearer to it.\n\n\u201cLove? What is love?\u201d he thought.\n\n\u201cLove hinders death. Love is life. All, everything that I understand, I understand only because I love. Everything is, everything exists, only because I love. Everything is united by it alone. Love is God, and to die means that I, a particle of love, shall return to the general and eternal source.\u201d These thoughts seemed to him comforting. But they were only thoughts. Something was lacking in them, they were not clear, they were too one-sidedly personal and brain-spun. And there was the former agitation and obscurity. He fell asleep.\n\nHe dreamed that he was lying in the room he really was in, but that he was quite well and unwounded. Many various, indifferent, and insignificant people appeared before him. He talked to them and discussed something trivial. They were preparing to go away somewhere. Prince Andrew dimly realized that all this was trivial and that he had more important cares, but he continued to speak, surprising them by empty witticisms. Gradually, unnoticed, all these persons began to disappear and a single question, that of the closed door, superseded all else. He rose and went to the door to bolt and lock it. Everything depended on whether he was, or was not, in time to lock it. He went, and tried to hurry, but his legs refused to move and he knew he would not be in time to lock the door though he painfully strained all his powers. He was seized by an agonizing fear. And that fear was the fear of death. It stood behind the door. But just when he was clumsily creeping toward the door, that dreadful something on the other side was already pressing against it and forcing its way in. Something not human\u2014death\u2014was breaking in through that door, and had to be kept out. He seized the door, making a final effort to hold it back\u2014to lock it was no longer possible\u2014but his efforts were weak and clumsy and the door, pushed from behind by that terror, opened and closed again.\n\nOnce again it pushed from outside. His last superhuman efforts were vain and both halves of the door noiselessly opened. It entered, and it was death, and Prince Andrew died.\n\nBut at the instant he died, Prince Andrew remembered that he was asleep, and at the very instant he died, having made an effort, he awoke.\n\n\u201cYes, it was death! I died\u2014and woke up. Yes, death is an awakening!\u201d And all at once it grew light in his soul and the veil that had till then concealed the unknown was lifted from his spiritual vision. He felt as if powers till then confined within him had been liberated, and that strange lightness did not again leave him.\n\nWhen, waking in a cold perspiration, he moved on the divan, Nat\u00e1sha went up and asked him what was the matter. He did not answer and looked at her strangely, not understanding.\n\nThat was what had happened to him two days before Princess Mary\u2019s arrival. From that day, as the doctor expressed it, the wasting fever assumed a malignant character, but what the doctor said did not interest Nat\u00e1sha, she saw the terrible moral symptoms which to her were more convincing.\n\nFrom that day an awakening from life came to Prince Andrew together with his awakening from sleep. And compared to the duration of life it did not seem to him slower than an awakening from sleep compared to the duration of a dream.\n\nThere was nothing terrible or violent in this comparatively slow awakening.\n\nHis last days and hours passed in an ordinary and simple way. Both Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha, who did not leave him, felt this. They did not weep or shudder and during these last days they themselves felt that they were not attending on him (he was no longer there, he had left them) but on what reminded them most closely of him\u2014his body. Both felt this so strongly that the outward and terrible side of death did not affect them and they did not feel it necessary to foment their grief. Neither in his presence nor out of it did they weep, nor did they ever talk to one another about him. They felt that they could not express in words what they understood.\n\nThey both saw that he was sinking slowly and quietly, deeper and deeper, away from them, and they both knew that this had to be so and that it was right.\n\nHe confessed, and received communion: everyone came to take leave of him. When they brought his son to him, he pressed his lips to the boy\u2019s and turned away, not because he felt it hard and sad (Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha understood that) but simply because he thought it was all that was required of him, but when they told him to bless the boy, he did what was demanded and looked round as if asking whether there was anything else he should do.\n\nWhen the last convulsions of the body, which the spirit was leaving, occurred, Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha were present.\n\n\u201cIs it over?\u201d said Princess Mary when his body had for a few minutes lain motionless, growing cold before them. Nat\u00e1sha went up, looked at the dead eyes, and hastened to close them. She closed them but did not kiss them, but clung to that which reminded her most nearly of him\u2014his body.\n\n\u201cWhere has he gone? Where is he now?...\u201d\n\nWhen the body, washed and dressed, lay in the coffin on a table, everyone came to take leave of him and they all wept.\n\nLittle Nicholas cried because his heart was rent by painful perplexity. The countess and S\u00f3nya cried from pity for Nat\u00e1sha and because he was no more. The old count cried because he felt that before long, he, too, must take the same terrible step.\n\nNat\u00e1sha and Princess Mary also wept now, but not because of their own personal grief; they wept with a reverent and softening emotion which had taken possession of their souls at the consciousness of the simple and solemn mystery of death that had been accomplished in their presence.\n\n\n\nBOOK THIRTEEN: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nMan\u2019s mind cannot grasp the causes of events in their completeness, but the desire to find those causes is implanted in man\u2019s soul. And without considering the multiplicity and complexity of the conditions any one of which taken separately may seem to be the cause, he snatches at the first approximation to a cause that seems to him intelligible and says: \u201cThis is the cause!\u201d In historical events (where the actions of men are the subject of observation) the first and most primitive approximation to present itself was the will of the gods and, after that, the will of those who stood in the most prominent position\u2014the heroes of history. But we need only penetrate to the essence of any historic event\u2014which lies in the activity of the general mass of men who take part in it\u2014to be convinced that the will of the historic hero does not control the actions of the mass but is itself continually controlled. It may seem to be a matter of indifference whether we understand the meaning of historical events this way or that; yet there is the same difference between a man who says that the people of the West moved on the East because Napoleon wished it and a man who says that this happened because it had to happen, as there is between those who declared that the earth was stationary and that the planets moved round it and those who admitted that they did not know what upheld the earth, but knew there were laws directing its movement and that of the other planets. There is, and can be, no cause of an historical event except the one cause of all causes. But there are laws directing events, and some of these laws are known to us while we are conscious of others we cannot comprehend. The discovery of these laws is only possible when we have quite abandoned the attempt to find the cause in the will of some one man, just as the discovery of the laws of the motion of the planets was possible only when men abandoned the conception of the fixity of the earth.\n\nThe historians consider that, next to the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and the occupation of Moscow by the enemy and its destruction by fire, the most important episode of the war of 1812 was the movement of the Russian army from the Ryaz\u00e1na to the Kal\u00faga road and to the Tar\u00fatino camp\u2014the so-called flank march across the Kr\u00e1snaya Pakhr\u00e1 River. They ascribe the glory of that achievement of genius to different men and dispute as to whom the honor is due. Even foreign historians, including the French, acknowledge the genius of the Russian commanders when they speak of that flank march. But it is hard to understand why military writers, and following them others, consider this flank march to be the profound conception of some one man who saved Russia and destroyed Napoleon. In the first place it is hard to understand where the profundity and genius of this movement lay, for not much mental effort was needed to see that the best position for an army when it is not being attacked is where there are most provisions; and even a dull boy of thirteen could have guessed that the best position for an army after its retreat from Moscow in 1812 was on the Kal\u00faga road. So it is impossible to understand by what reasoning the historians reach the conclusion that this maneuver was a profound one. And it is even more difficult to understand just why they think that this maneuver was calculated to save Russia and destroy the French; for this flank march, had it been preceded, accompanied, or followed by other circumstances, might have proved ruinous to the Russians and salutary for the French. If the position of the Russian army really began to improve from the time of that march, it does not at all follow that the march was the cause of it.\n\nThat flank march might not only have failed to give any advantage to the Russian army, but might in other circumstances have led to its destruction. What would have happened had Moscow not burned down? If Murat had not lost sight of the Russians? If Napoleon had not remained inactive? If the Russian army at Kr\u00e1snaya Pakhr\u00e1 had given battle as Bennigsen and Barclay advised? What would have happened had the French attacked the Russians while they were marching beyond the Pakhr\u00e1? What would have happened if on approaching Tar\u00fatino, Napoleon had attacked the Russians with but a tenth of the energy he had shown when he attacked them at Smol\u00e9nsk? What would have happened had the French moved on Petersburg?... In any of these eventualities the flank march that brought salvation might have proved disastrous.\n\nThe third and most incomprehensible thing is that people studying history deliberately avoid seeing that this flank march cannot be attributed to any one man, that no one ever foresaw it, and that in reality, like the retreat from Fil\u00ed, it did not suggest itself to anyone in its entirety, but resulted\u2014moment by moment, step by step, event by event\u2014from an endless number of most diverse circumstances and was only seen in its entirety when it had been accomplished and belonged to the past.\n\nAt the council at Fil\u00ed the prevailing thought in the minds of the Russian commanders was the one naturally suggesting itself, namely, a direct retreat by the N\u00edzhni road. In proof of this there is the fact that the majority of the council voted for such a retreat, and above all there is the well-known conversation after the council, between the commander in chief and Lansk\u00f3y, who was in charge of the commissariat department. Lansk\u00f3y informed the commander in chief that the army supplies were for the most part stored along the Ok\u00e1 in the T\u00fala and Ryaz\u00e1n provinces, and that if they retreated on N\u00edzhni the army would be separated from its supplies by the broad river Ok\u00e1, which cannot be crossed early in winter. This was the first indication of the necessity of deviating from what had previously seemed the most natural course\u2014a direct retreat on N\u00edzhni-N\u00f3vgorod. The army turned more to the south, along the Ryaz\u00e1n road and nearer to its supplies. Subsequently the inactivity of the French (who even lost sight of the Russian army), concern for the safety of the arsenal at T\u00fala, and especially the advantages of drawing nearer to its supplies caused the army to turn still further south to the T\u00fala road. Having crossed over, by a forced march, to the T\u00fala road beyond the Pakhr\u00e1, the Russian commanders intended to remain at Pod\u00f3lsk and had no thought of the Tar\u00fatino position; but innumerable circumstances and the reappearance of French troops who had for a time lost touch with the Russians, and projects of giving battle, and above all the abundance of provisions in Kal\u00faga province, obliged our army to turn still more to the south and to cross from the T\u00fala to the Kal\u00faga road and go to Tar\u00fatino, which was between the roads along which those supplies lay. Just as it is impossible to say when it was decided to abandon Moscow, so it is impossible to say precisely when, or by whom, it was decided to move to Tar\u00fatino. Only when the army had got there, as the result of innumerable and varying forces, did people begin to assure themselves that they had desired this movement and long ago foreseen its result.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nThe famous flank movement merely consisted in this: after the advance of the French had ceased, the Russian army, which had been continually retreating straight back from the invaders, deviated from that direct course and, not finding itself pursued, was naturally drawn toward the district where supplies were abundant.\n\nIf instead of imagining to ourselves commanders of genius leading the Russian army, we picture that army without any leaders, it could not have done anything but make a return movement toward Moscow, describing an arc in the direction where most provisions were to be found and where the country was richest.\n\nThat movement from the N\u00edzhni to the Ryaz\u00e1n, T\u00fala, and Kal\u00faga roads was so natural that even the Russian marauders moved in that direction, and demands were sent from Petersburg for Kut\u00fazov to take his army that way. At Tar\u00fatino Kut\u00fazov received what was almost a reprimand from the Emperor for having moved his army along the Ryaz\u00e1n road, and the Emperor\u2019s letter indicated to him the very position he had already occupied near Kal\u00faga.\n\nHaving rolled like a ball in the direction of the impetus given by the whole campaign and by the battle of Borodin\u00f3, the Russian army\u2014when the strength of that impetus was exhausted and no fresh push was received\u2014assumed the position natural to it.\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s merit lay, not in any strategic maneuver of genius, as it is called, but in the fact that he alone understood the significance of what had happened. He alone then understood the meaning of the French army\u2019s inactivity, he alone continued to assert that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 had been a victory, he alone\u2014who as commander in chief might have been expected to be eager to attack\u2014employed his whole strength to restrain the Russian army from useless engagements.\n\nThe beast wounded at Borodin\u00f3 was lying where the fleeing hunter had left him; but whether he was still alive, whether he was strong and merely lying low, the hunter did not know. Suddenly the beast was heard to moan.\n\nThe moan of that wounded beast (the French army) which betrayed its calamitous condition was the sending of Lauriston to Kut\u00fazov\u2019s camp with overtures for peace.\n\nNapoleon, with his usual assurance that whatever entered his head was right, wrote to Kut\u00fazov the first words that occurred to him, though they were meaningless.\n\n\nMONSIEUR LE PRINCE KOUTOUZOV: I am sending one of my adjutants-general to discuss several interesting questions with you. I beg your Highness to credit what he says to you, especially when he expresses the sentiment of esteem and special regard I have long entertained for your person. This letter having no other object, I pray God, monsieur le prince Koutouzov, to keep you in His holy and gracious protection!\n\nNAPOLEON\n\nMOSCOW, OCTOBER 30, 1812\n\n\nKut\u00fazov replied: \u201cI should be cursed by posterity were I looked on as the initiator of a settlement of any sort. Such is the present spirit of my nation.\u201d But he continued to exert all his powers to restrain his troops from attacking.\n\nDuring the month that the French troops were pillaging in Moscow and the Russian troops were quietly encamped at Tar\u00fatino, a change had taken place in the relative strength of the two armies\u2014both in spirit and in number\u2014as a result of which the superiority had passed to the Russian side. Though the condition and numbers of the French army were unknown to the Russians, as soon as that change occurred the need of attacking at once showed itself by countless signs. These signs were: Lauriston\u2019s mission; the abundance of provisions at Tar\u00fatino; the reports coming in from all sides of the inactivity and disorder of the French; the flow of recruits to our regiments; the fine weather; the long rest the Russian soldiers had enjoyed, and the impatience to do what they had been assembled for, which usually shows itself in an army that has been resting; curiosity as to what the French army, so long lost sight of, was doing; the boldness with which our outposts now scouted close up to the French stationed at Tar\u00fatino; the news of easy successes gained by peasants and guerrilla troops over the French, the envy aroused by this; the desire for revenge that lay in the heart of every Russian as long as the French were in Moscow, and (above all) a dim consciousness in every soldier\u2019s mind that the relative strength of the armies had changed and that the advantage was now on our side. There was a substantial change in the relative strength, and an advance had become inevitable. And at once, as a clock begins to strike and chime as soon as the minute hand has completed a full circle, this change was shown by an increased activity, whirring, and chiming in the higher spheres.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe Russian army was commanded by Kut\u00fazov and his staff, and also by the Emperor from Petersburg. Before the news of the abandonment of Moscow had been received in Petersburg, a detailed plan of the whole campaign had been drawn up and sent to Kut\u00fazov for his guidance. Though this plan had been drawn up on the supposition that Moscow was still in our hands, it was approved by the staff and accepted as a basis for action. Kut\u00fazov only replied that movements arranged from a distance were always difficult to execute. So fresh instructions were sent for the solution of difficulties that might be encountered, as well as fresh people who were to watch Kut\u00fazov\u2019s actions and report upon them.\n\nBesides this, the whole staff of the Russian army was now reorganized. The posts left vacant by Bagrati\u00f3n, who had been killed, and by Barclay, who had gone away in dudgeon, had to be filled. Very serious consideration was given to the question whether it would be better to put A in B\u2019s place and B in D\u2019s, or on the contrary to put D in A\u2019s place, and so on\u2014as if anything more than A\u2019s or B\u2019s satisfaction depended on this.\n\nAs a result of the hostility between Kut\u00fazov and Bennigsen, his Chief of Staff, the presence of confidential representatives of the Emperor, and these transfers, a more than usually complicated play of parties was going on among the staff of the army. A was undermining B, D was undermining C, and so on in all possible combinations and permutations. In all these plottings the subject of intrigue was generally the conduct of the war, which all these men believed they were directing; but this affair of the war went on independently of them, as it had to go: that is, never in the way people devised, but flowing always from the essential attitude of the masses. Only in the highest spheres did all these schemes, crossings, and interminglings appear to be a true reflection of what had to happen.\n\n\nPrince Michael Ilari\u00f3novich! (wrote the Emperor on the second of October in a letter that reached Kut\u00fazov after the battle at Tar\u00fatino) Since September 2 Moscow has been in the hands of the enemy. Your last reports were written on the twentieth, and during all this time not only has no action been taken against the enemy or for the relief of the ancient capital, but according to your last report you have even retreated farther. S\u00e9rpukhov is already occupied by an enemy detachment and T\u00fala with its famous arsenal, so indispensable to the army, is in danger. From General Wintzingerode\u2019s reports, I see that an enemy corps of ten thousand men is moving on the Petersburg road. Another corps of several thousand men is moving on Dm\u00edtrov. A third has advanced along the Vlad\u00edmir road, and a fourth, rather considerable detachment is stationed between R\u00faza and Mozh\u00e1ysk. Napoleon himself was in Moscow as late as the twenty-fifth. In view of all this information, when the enemy has scattered his forces in large detachments, and with Napoleon and his Guards in Moscow, is it possible that the enemy\u2019s forces confronting you are so considerable as not to allow of your taking the offensive? On the contrary, he is probably pursuing you with detachments, or at most with an army corps much weaker than the army entrusted to you. It would seem that, availing yourself of these circumstances, you might advantageously attack a weaker one and annihilate him, or at least oblige him to retreat, retaining in our hands an important part of the provinces now occupied by the enemy, and thereby averting danger from T\u00fala and other towns in the interior. You will be responsible if the enemy is able to direct a force of any size against Petersburg to threaten this capital in which it has not been possible to retain many troops; for with the army entrusted to you, and acting with resolution and energy, you have ample means to avert this fresh calamity. Remember that you have still to answer to our offended country for the loss of Moscow. You have experienced my readiness to reward you. That readiness will not weaken in me, but I and Russia have a right to expect from you all the zeal, firmness, and success which your intellect, military talent, and the courage of the troops you command justify us in expecting.\n\n\nBut by the time this letter, which proved that the real relation of the forces had already made itself felt in Petersburg, was dispatched, Kut\u00fazov had found himself unable any longer to restrain the army he commanded from attacking and a battle had taken place.\n\nOn the second of October a Cossack, Shapov\u00e1lov, who was out scouting, killed one hare and wounded another. Following the wounded hare he made his way far into the forest and came upon the left flank of Murat\u2019s army, encamped there without any precautions. The Cossack laughingly told his comrades how he had almost fallen into the hands of the French. A cornet, hearing the story, informed his commander.\n\nThe Cossack was sent for and questioned. The Cossack officers wished to take advantage of this chance to capture some horses, but one of the su", "sequence": 25}, {"offset": 2600000, "text": "perior officers, who was acquainted with the higher authorities, reported the incident to a general on the staff. The state of things on the staff had of late been exceedingly strained. Erm\u00f3lov had been to see Bennigsen a few days previously and had entreated him to use his influence with the commander in chief to induce him to take the offensive.\n\n\u201cIf I did not know you I should think you did not want what you are asking for. I need only advise anything and his Highness is sure to do the opposite,\u201d replied Bennigsen.\n\nThe Cossack\u2019s report, confirmed by horse patrols who were sent out, was the final proof that events had matured. The tightly coiled spring was released, the clock began to whirr and the chimes to play. Despite all his supposed power, his intellect, his experience, and his knowledge of men, Kut\u00fazov\u2014having taken into consideration the Cossack\u2019s report, a note from Bennigsen who sent personal reports to the Emperor, the wishes he supposed the Emperor to hold, and the fact that all the generals expressed the same wish\u2014could no longer check the inevitable movement, and gave the order to do what he regarded as useless and harmful\u2014gave his approval, that is, to the accomplished fact.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nBennigsen\u2019s note and the Cossack\u2019s information that the left flank of the French was unguarded were merely final indications that it was necessary to order an attack, and it was fixed for the fifth of October.\n\nOn the morning of the fourth of October Kut\u00fazov signed the dispositions. Toll read them to Erm\u00f3lov, asking him to attend to the further arrangements.\n\n\u201cAll right\u2014all right. I haven\u2019t time just now,\u201d replied Erm\u00f3lov, and left the hut.\n\nThe dispositions drawn up by Toll were very good. As in the Austerlitz dispositions, it was written\u2014though not in German this time:\n\n\u201cThe First Column will march here and here,\u201d \u201cthe Second Column will march there and there,\u201d and so on; and on paper, all these columns arrived at their places at the appointed time and destroyed the enemy. Everything had been admirably thought out as is usual in dispositions, and as is always the case, not a single column reached its place at the appointed time.\n\nWhen the necessary number of copies of the dispositions had been prepared, an officer was summoned and sent to deliver them to Erm\u00f3lov to deal with. A young officer of the Horse Guards, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s orderly, pleased at the importance of the mission entrusted to him, went to Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s quarters.\n\n\u201cGone away,\u201d said Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s orderly.\n\nThe officer of the Horse Guards went to a general with whom Erm\u00f3lov was often to be found.\n\n\u201cNo, and the general\u2019s out too.\u201d\n\nThe officer, mounting his horse, rode off to someone else.\n\n\u201cNo, he\u2019s gone out.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf only they don\u2019t make me responsible for this delay! What a nuisance it is!\u201d thought the officer, and he rode round the whole camp. One man said he had seen Erm\u00f3lov ride past with some other generals, others said he must have returned home. The officer searched till six o\u2019clock in the evening without even stopping to eat. Erm\u00f3lov was nowhere to be found and no one knew where he was. The officer snatched a little food at a comrade\u2019s, and rode again to the vanguard to find Milor\u00e1dovich. Milor\u00e1dovich too was away, but here he was told that he had gone to a ball at General K\u00edkin\u2019s and that Erm\u00f3lov was probably there too.\n\n\u201cBut where is it?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, there, over at \u00c9chkino,\u201d said a Cossack officer, pointing to a country house in the far distance.\n\n\u201cWhat, outside our line?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve put two regiments as outposts, and they\u2019re having such a spree there, it\u2019s awful! Two bands and three sets of singers!\u201d\n\nThe officer rode out beyond our lines to \u00c9chkino. While still at a distance he heard as he rode the merry sounds of a soldier\u2019s dance song proceeding from the house.\n\n\u201cIn the meadows... in the meadows!\u201d he heard, accompanied by whistling and the sound of a torban, drowned every now and then by shouts. These sounds made his spirits rise, but at the same time he was afraid that he would be blamed for not having executed sooner the important order entrusted to him. It was already past eight o\u2019clock. He dismounted and went up into the porch of a large country house which had remained intact between the Russian and French forces. In the refreshment room and the hall, footmen were bustling about with wine and viands. Groups of singers stood outside the windows. The officer was admitted and immediately saw all the chief generals of the army together, and among them Erm\u00f3lov\u2019s big imposing figure. They all had their coats unbuttoned and were standing in a semicircle with flushed and animated faces, laughing loudly. In the middle of the room a short handsome general with a red face was dancing the trep\u00e1k with much spirit and agility.\n\n\u201cHa, ha, ha! Bravo, Nicholas Iv\u00e1nych! Ha, ha, ha!\u201d\n\nThe officer felt that by arriving with important orders at such a moment he was doubly to blame, and he would have preferred to wait; but one of the generals espied him and, hearing what he had come about, informed Erm\u00f3lov.\n\nErm\u00f3lov came forward with a frown on his face and, hearing what the officer had to say, took the papers from him without a word.\n\n\n\u201cYou think he went off just by chance?\u201d said a comrade, who was on the staff that evening, to the officer of the Horse Guards, referring to Erm\u00f3lov. \u201cIt was a trick. It was done on purpose to get Konovn\u00edtsyn into trouble. You\u2019ll see what a mess there\u2019ll be tomorrow.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNext day the decrepit Kut\u00fazov, having given orders to be called early, said his prayers, dressed, and, with an unpleasant consciousness of having to direct a battle he did not approve of, got into his cal\u00e8che and drove from Letash\u00f3vka (a village three and a half miles from Tar\u00fatino) to the place where the attacking columns were to meet. He sat in the cal\u00e8che, dozing and waking up by turns, and listening for any sound of firing on the right as an indication that the action had begun. But all was still quiet. A damp dull autumn morning was just dawning. On approaching Tar\u00fatino Kut\u00fazov noticed cavalrymen leading their horses to water across the road along which he was driving. Kut\u00fazov looked at them searchingly, stopped his carriage, and inquired what regiment they belonged to. They belonged to a column that should have been far in front and in ambush long before then. \u201cIt may be a mistake,\u201d thought the old commander in chief. But a little further on he saw infantry regiments with their arms piled and the soldiers, only partly dressed, eating their rye porridge and carrying fuel. He sent for an officer. The officer reported that no order to advance had been received.\n\n\u201cHow! Not rec...\u201d Kut\u00fazov began, but checked himself immediately and sent for a senior officer. Getting out of his cal\u00e8che, he waited with drooping head and breathing heavily, pacing silently up and down. When E\u00fdkhen, the officer of the general staff whom he had summoned, appeared, Kut\u00fazov went purple in the face, not because that officer was to blame for the mistake, but because he was an object of sufficient importance for him to vent his wrath on. Trembling and panting the old man fell into that state of fury in which he sometimes used to roll on the ground, and he fell upon E\u00fdkhen, threatening him with his hands, shouting and loading him with gross abuse. Another man, Captain Br\u00f3zin, who happened to turn up and who was not at all to blame, suffered the same fate.\n\n\u201cWhat sort of another blackguard are you? I\u2019ll have you shot! Scoundrels!\u201d yelled Kut\u00fazov in a hoarse voice, waving his arms and reeling.\n\nHe was suffering physically. He, the commander in chief, a Serene Highness who everybody said possessed powers such as no man had ever had in Russia, to be placed in this position\u2014made the laughingstock of the whole army! \u201cI needn\u2019t have been in such a hurry to pray about today, or have kept awake thinking everything over all night,\u201d thought he to himself. \u201cWhen I was a chit of an officer no one would have dared to mock me so... and now!\u201d He was in a state of physical suffering as if from corporal punishment, and could not avoid expressing it by cries of anger and distress. But his strength soon began to fail him, and looking about him, conscious of having said much that was amiss, he again got into his cal\u00e8che and drove back in silence.\n\nHis wrath, once expended, did not return, and blinking feebly he listened to excuses and self-justifications (Erm\u00f3lov did not come to see him till the next day) and to the insistence of Bennigsen, Konovn\u00edtsyn, and Toll that the movement that had miscarried should be executed next day. And once more Kut\u00fazov had to consent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nNext day the troops assembled in their appointed places in the evening and advanced during the night. It was an autumn night with dark purple clouds, but no rain. The ground was damp but not muddy, and the troops advanced noiselessly, only occasionally a jingling of the artillery could be faintly heard. The men were forbidden to talk out loud, to smoke their pipes, or to strike a light, and they tried to prevent their horses neighing. The secrecy of the undertaking heightened its charm and they marched gaily. Some columns, supposing they had reached their destination, halted, piled arms, and settled down on the cold ground, but the majority marched all night and arrived at places where they evidently should not have been.\n\nOnly Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov with his Cossacks (the least important detachment of all) got to his appointed place at the right time. This detachment halted at the outskirts of a forest, on the path leading from the village of Strom\u00edlova to Dm\u00edtrovsk.\n\nToward dawn, Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov, who had dozed off, was awakened by a deserter from the French army being brought to him. This was a Polish sergeant of Poniatowski\u2019s corps, who explained in Polish that he had come over because he had been slighted in the service: that he ought long ago to have been made an officer, that he was braver than any of them, and so he had left them and wished to pay them out. He said that Murat was spending the night less than a mile from where they were, and that if they would let him have a convoy of a hundred men he would capture him alive. Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov consulted his fellow officers.\n\nThe offer was too tempting to be refused. Everyone volunteered to go and everybody advised making the attempt. After much disputing and arguing, Major-General Gr\u00e9kov with two Cossack regiments decided to go with the Polish sergeant.\n\n\u201cNow, remember,\u201d said Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov to the sergeant at parting, \u201cif you have been lying I\u2019ll have you hanged like a dog; but if it\u2019s true you shall have a hundred gold pieces!\u201d\n\nWithout replying, the sergeant, with a resolute air, mounted and rode away with Gr\u00e9kov whose men had quickly assembled. They disappeared into the forest, and Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov, having seen Gr\u00e9kov off, returned, shivering from the freshness of the early dawn and excited by what he had undertaken on his own responsibility, and began looking at the enemy camp, now just visible in the deceptive light of dawn and the dying campfires. Our columns ought to have begun to appear on an open declivity to his right. He looked in that direction, but though the columns would have been visible quite far off, they were not to be seen. It seemed to the count that things were beginning to stir in the French camp, and his keen-sighted adjutant confirmed this.\n\n\u201cOh, it is really too late,\u201d said Count Orl\u00f3v, looking at the camp.\n\nAs often happens when someone we have trusted is no longer before our eyes, it suddenly seemed quite clear and obvious to him that the sergeant was an impostor, that he had lied, and that the whole Russian attack would be ruined by the absence of those two regiments, which he would lead away heaven only knew where. How could one capture a commander in chief from among such a mass of troops!\n\n\u201cI am sure that rascal was lying,\u201d said the count.\n\n\u201cThey can still be called back,\u201d said one of his suite, who like Count Orl\u00f3v felt distrustful of the adventure when he looked at the enemy\u2019s camp.\n\n\u201cEh? Really... what do you think? Should we let them go on or not?\u201d\n\n\u201cWill you have them fetched back?\u201d\n\n\u201cFetch them back, fetch them back!\u201d said Count Orl\u00f3v with sudden determination, looking at his watch. \u201cIt will be too late. It is quite light.\u201d\n\nAnd the adjutant galloped through the forest after Gr\u00e9kov. When Gr\u00e9kov returned, Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov, excited both by the abandoned attempt and by vainly awaiting the infantry columns that still did not appear, as well as by the proximity of the enemy, resolved to advance. All his men felt the same excitement.\n\n\u201cMount!\u201d he commanded in a whisper. The men took their places and crossed themselves.... \u201cForward, with God\u2019s aid!\u201d\n\n\u201cHurrah-ah-ah!\u201d reverberated in the forest, and the Cossack companies, trailing their lances and advancing one after another as if poured out of a sack, dashed gaily across the brook toward the camp.\n\nOne desperate, frightened yell from the first French soldier who saw the Cossacks, and all who were in the camp, undressed and only just waking up, ran off in all directions, abandoning cannons, muskets, and horses.\n\nHad the Cossacks pursued the French, without heeding what was behind and around them, they would have captured Murat and everything there. That was what the officers desired. But it was impossible to make the Cossacks budge when once they had got booty and prisoners. None of them listened to orders. Fifteen hundred prisoners and thirty-eight guns were taken on the spot, besides standards and (what seemed most important to the Cossacks) horses, saddles, horsecloths, and the like. All this had to be dealt with, the prisoners and guns secured, the booty divided\u2014not without some shouting and even a little fighting among themselves\u2014and it was on this that the Cossacks all busied themselves.\n\nThe French, not being farther pursued, began to recover themselves: they formed into detachments and began firing. Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov, still waiting for the other columns to arrive, advanced no further.\n\nMeantime, according to the dispositions which said that \u201cthe First Column will march\u201d and so on, the infantry of the belated columns, commanded by Bennigsen and directed by Toll, had started in due order and, as always happens, had got somewhere, but not to their appointed places. As always happens the men, starting cheerfully, began to halt; murmurs were heard, there was a sense of confusion, and finally a backward movement. Adjutants and generals galloped about, shouted, grew angry, quarreled, said they had come quite wrong and were late, gave vent to a little abuse, and at last gave it all up and went forward, simply to get somewhere. \u201cWe shall get somewhere or other!\u201d And they did indeed get somewhere, though not to their right places; a few eventually even got to their right place, but too late to be of any use and only in time to be fired at. Toll, who in this battle played the part of Weyrother at Austerlitz, galloped assiduously from place to place, finding everything upside down everywhere. Thus he stumbled on Bagov\u00fat\u2019s corps in a wood when it was already broad daylight, though the corps should long before have joined Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov. Excited and vexed by the failure and supposing that someone must be responsible for it, Toll galloped up to the commander of the corps and began upbraiding him severely, saying that he ought to be shot. General Bagov\u00fat, a fighting old soldier of placid temperament, being also upset by all the delay, confusion, and cross-purposes, fell into a rage to everybody\u2019s surprise and quite contrary to his usual character and said disagreeable things to Toll.\n\n\u201cI prefer not to take lessons from anyone, but I can die with my men as well as anybody,\u201d he said, and advanced with a single division.\n\nComing out onto a field under the enemy\u2019s fire, this brave general went straight ahead, leading his men under fire, without considering in his agitation whether going into action now, with a single division, would be of any use or no. Danger, cannon balls, and bullets were just what he needed in his angry mood. One of the first bullets killed him, and other bullets killed many of his men. And his division remained under fire for some time quite uselessly.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nMeanwhile another column was to have attacked the French from the front, but Kut\u00fazov accompanied that column. He well knew that nothing but confusion would come of this battle undertaken against his will, and as far as was in his power held the troops back. He did not advance.\n\nHe rode silently on his small gray horse, indolently answering suggestions that they should attack.\n\n\u201cThe word attack is always on your tongue, but you don\u2019t see that we are unable to execute complicated maneuvers,\u201d said he to Milor\u00e1dovich who asked permission to advance.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t take Murat prisoner this morning or get to the place in time, and nothing can be done now!\u201d he replied to someone else.\n\nWhen Kut\u00fazov was informed that at the French rear\u2014where according to the reports of the Cossacks there had previously been nobody\u2014there were now two battalions of Poles, he gave a sidelong glance at Erm\u00f3lov who was behind him and to whom he had not spoken since the previous day.\n\n\u201cYou see! They are asking to attack and making plans of all kinds, but as soon as one gets to business nothing is ready, and the enemy, forewarned, takes measures accordingly.\u201d\n\nErm\u00f3lov screwed up his eyes and smiled faintly on hearing these words. He understood that for him the storm had blown over, and that Kut\u00fazov would content himself with that hint.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s having a little fun at my expense,\u201d said Erm\u00f3lov softly, nudging with his knee Ra\u00e9vski who was at his side.\n\nSoon after this, Erm\u00f3lov moved up to Kut\u00fazov and respectfully remarked:\n\n\u201cIt is not too late yet, your Highness\u2014the enemy has not gone away\u2014if you were to order an attack! If not, the Guards will not so much as see a little smoke.\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov did not reply, but when they reported to him that Murat\u2019s troops were in retreat he ordered an advance, though at every hundred paces he halted for three quarters of an hour.\n\nThe whole battle consisted in what Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov\u2019s Cossacks had done: the rest of the army merely lost some hundreds of men uselessly.\n\nIn consequence of this battle Kut\u00fazov received a diamond decoration, and Bennigsen some diamonds and a hundred thousand rubles, others also received pleasant recognitions corresponding to their various grades, and following the battle fresh changes were made in the staff.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how everything is done with us, all topsy-turvy!\u201d said the Russian officers and generals after the Tar\u00fatino battle, letting it be understood that some fool there is doing things all wrong but that we ourselves should not have done so, just as people speak today. But people who talk like that either do not know what they are talking about or deliberately deceive themselves. No battle\u2014Tar\u00fatino, Borodin\u00f3, or Austerlitz\u2014takes place as those who planned it anticipated. That is an essential condition.\n\nA countless number of free forces (for nowhere is man freer than during a battle, where it is a question of life and death) influence the course taken by the fight, and that course never can be known in advance and never coincides with the direction of any one force.\n\nIf many simultaneously and variously directed forces act on a given body, the direction of its motion cannot coincide with any one of those forces, but will always be a mean\u2014what in mechanics is represented by the diagonal of a parallelogram of forces.\n\nIf in the descriptions given by historians, especially French ones, we find their wars and battles carried out in accordance with previously formed plans, the only conclusion to be drawn is that those descriptions are false.\n\nThe battle of Tar\u00fatino obviously did not attain the aim Toll had in view\u2014to lead the troops into action in the order prescribed by the dispositions; nor that which Count Orl\u00f3v-Den\u00edsov may have had in view\u2014to take Murat prisoner; nor the result of immediately destroying the whole corps, which Bennigsen and others may have had in view; nor the aim of the officer who wished to go into action to distinguish himself; nor that of the Cossack who wanted more booty than he got, and so on. But if the aim of the battle was what actually resulted and what all the Russians of that day desired\u2014to drive the French out of Russia and destroy their army\u2014it is quite clear that the battle of Tar\u00fatino, just because of its incongruities, was exactly what was wanted at that stage of the campaign. It would be difficult and even impossible to imagine any result more opportune than the actual outcome of this battle. With a minimum of effort and insignificant losses, despite the greatest confusion, the most important results of the whole campaign were attained: the transition from retreat to advance, an exposure of the weakness of the French, and the administration of that shock which Napoleon\u2019s army had only awaited to begin its flight.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nNapoleon enters Moscow after the brilliant victory de la Moskowa; there can be no doubt about the victory for the battlefield remains in the hands of the French. The Russians retreat and abandon their ancient capital. Moscow, abounding in provisions, arms, munitions, and incalculable wealth, is in Napoleon\u2019s hands. The Russian army, only half the strength of the French, does not make a single attempt to attack for a whole month. Napoleon\u2019s position is most brilliant. He can either fall on the Russian army with double its strength and destroy it; negotiate an advantageous peace, or in case of a refusal make a menacing move on Petersburg, or even, in the case of a reverse, return to Smol\u00e9nsk or V\u00edlna; or remain in Moscow; in short, no special genius would seem to be required to retain the brilliant position the French held at that time. For that, only very simple and easy steps were necessary: not to allow the troops to loot, to prepare winter clothing\u2014of which there was sufficient in Moscow for the whole army\u2014and methodically to collect the provisions, of which (according to the French historians) there were enough in Moscow to supply the whole army for six months. Yet Napoleon, that greatest of all geniuses, who the historians declare had control of the army, took none of these steps.\n\nHe not merely did nothing of the kind, but on the contrary he used his power to select the most foolish and ruinous of all the courses open to him. Of all that Napoleon might have done: wintering in Moscow, advancing on Petersburg or on N\u00edzhni-N\u00f3vgorod, or retiring by a more northerly or more southerly route (say by the road Kut\u00fazov afterwards took), nothing more stupid or disastrous can be imagined than what he actually did. He remained in Moscow till October, letting the troops plunder the city; then, hesitating whether to leave a garrison behind him, he quitted Moscow, approached Kut\u00fazov without joining battle, turned to the right and reached M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets, again without attempting to break through and take the road Kut\u00fazov took, but retiring instead to Mozh\u00e1ysk along the devastated Smol\u00e9nsk road. Nothing more stupid than that could have been devised, or more disastrous for the army, as the sequel showed. Had Napoleon\u2019s aim been to destroy his army, the most skillful strategist could hardly have devised any series of actions that would so completely have accomplished that purpose, independently of anything the Russian army might do.\n\nNapoleon, the man of genius, did this! But to say that he destroyed his army because he wished to, or because he was very stupid, would be as unjust as to say that he had brought his troops to Moscow because he wished to and because he was very clever and a genius.\n\nIn both cases his personal activity, having no more force than the personal activity of any soldier, merely coincided with the laws that guided the event.\n\nThe historians quite falsely represent Napoleon\u2019s faculties as having weakened in Moscow, and do so only because the results did not justify his actions. He employed all his ability and strength to do the best he could for himself and his army, as he had done previously and as he did subsequently in 1813. His activity at that time was no less astounding than it was in Egypt, in Italy, in Austria, and in Prussia. We do not know for certain in how far his genius was genuine in Egypt\u2014where forty centuries looked down upon his grandeur\u2014for his great exploits there are all told us by Frenchmen. We cannot accurately estimate his genius in Austria or Prussia, for we have to draw our information from French or German sources, and the incomprehensible surrender of whole corps without fighting and of fortresses without a siege must incline Germans to recognize his genius as the only explanation of the war carried on in Germany. But we, thank God, have no need to recognize his genius in order to hide our shame. We have paid for the right to look at the matter plainly and simply, and we will not abandon that right.\n\nHis activity in Moscow was as amazing and as full of genius as elsewhere. Order after order and plan after plan were issued by him from the time he entered Moscow till the time he left it. The absence of citizens and of a deputation, and even the burning of Moscow, did not disconcert him. He did not lose sight either of the welfare of his army or of the doings of the enemy, or of the welfare of the people of Russia, or of the direction of affairs in Paris, or of diplomatic considerations concerning the terms of the anticipated peace.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nWith regard to military matters, Napoleon immediately on his entry into Moscow gave General Sabastiani strict orders to observe the movements of the Russian army, sent army corps out along the different roads, and charged Murat to find Kut\u00fazov. Then he gave careful directions about the fortification of the Kr\u00e9mlin, and drew up a brilliant plan for a future campaign over the whole map of Russia.\n\nWith regard to diplomatic questions, Napoleon summoned Captain Y\u00e1kovlev, who had been robbed and was in rags and did not know how to get out of Moscow, minutely explained to him his whole policy and his magnanimity, and having written a letter to the Emperor Alexander in which he considered it his duty to inform his Friend and Brother that Rostopch\u00edn had managed affairs badly in Moscow, he dispatched Y\u00e1kovlev to Petersburg.\n\nHaving similarly explained his views and his magnanimity to Tut\u00f3lmin, he dispatched that old man also to Petersburg to negotiate.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, immediately after the fires he gave orders to find and execute the incendiaries. And the scoundrel Rostopch\u00edn was punished by an order to burn down his houses.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, Moscow was granted a constitution. A municipality was established and the following announcement issued:\n\n\nINHABITANTS OF MOSCOW!\n\nYour misfortunes are cruel, but His Majesty the Emperor and King desires to arrest their course. Terrible examples have taught you how he punishes disobedience and crime. Strict measures have been taken to put an end to disorder and to re-establish public security. A paternal administration, chosen from among yourselves, will form your municipality or city government. It will take care of you, of your needs, and of your welfare. Its members will be distinguished by a red ribbon worn across the shoulder, and the mayor of the city will wear a white belt as well. But when not on duty they will only wear a red ribbon round the left arm.\n\nThe city police is established on its former footing, and better order already prevails in consequence of its activity. The government has appointed two commissaries general, or chiefs of police, and twenty commissaries or captains of wards have been appointed to the different wards of the city. You will recognize them by the white ribbon they will wear on the left arm. Several churches of different denominations are open, and divine service is performed in them unhindered. Your fellow citizens are returning every day to their homes and orders have been given that they should find in them the help and protection due to their misfortunes. These are the measures the government has adopted to re-establish order and relieve your condition. But to achieve this aim it is necessary that you should add your efforts and should, if possible, forget the misfortunes you have suffered, should entertain the hope of a less cruel fate, should be certain that inevitable and ignominious death awaits those who make any attempt on your persons or on what remains of your property, and finally that you should not doubt that these will be safeguarded, since such is the will of the greatest and most just of monarchs. Soldiers and citizens, of whatever nation you may be, re-establish public confidence, the source of the welfare of a state, live like brothers, render mutual aid and protection one to another, unite to defeat the intentions of the evil-minded, obey the military and civil authorities, and your tears will soon cease to flow!\n\n\nWith regard to supplies for the army, Napoleon decreed that all the troops in turn should enter Moscow \u00e0 la maraude to obtain provisions for themselves, so that the army might have its future provided for.\n\nWith regard to religion, Napoleon ordered the priests to be brought back and services to be again performed in the churches.\n\nWith regard to commerce and to provisioning the army, the following was placarded everywhere:\n\nPROCLAMATION\n\nYou, peaceful inhabitants of Moscow, artisans and workmen whom misfortune has driven from the city, and you scattered tillers of the soil, still kept out in the fields by groundless fear, listen! Tranquillity is returning to this capital and order is being restored in it. Your fellow countrymen are emerging boldly from their hiding places on finding that they are respected. Any violence to them or to their property is promptly punished. His Majesty the Emperor and King protects them, and considers no one among you his enemy except those who disobey his orders. He desires to end your misfortunes and restore you to your homes and families. Respond, therefore, to his benevolent intentions and come to us without fear. Inhabitants, return with confidence to your abodes! You will soon find means of satisfying your needs. Craftsmen and industrious artisans, return to your work, your houses, your shops, where the protection of guards awaits you! You shall receive proper pay for your work. And lastly you too, peasants, come from the forests where you are hiding in terror, return to your huts without fear, in full assurance that you will find protection! Markets are established in the city where peasants can bring their surplus supplies and the products of the soil. The government has taken the following steps to ensure freedom of sale for them: (1) From today, peasants, husbandmen, and those living in the neighborhood of Moscow may without any danger bring their supplies of all kinds to two appointed markets, of which one is on the Mokhov\u00e1ya Street and the other at the Provision Market. (2) Such supplies will be bought from them at such prices as seller and buyer may agree on, and if a seller is unable to obtain a fair price he will be free to take his goods back to his village and no one may hinder him under any pretense. (3) Sunday and Wednesday of each week are appointed as the chief market days and to that end a sufficient number of troops will be stationed along the highroads on Tuesdays and Saturdays at such distances from the town as to protect the carts. (4) Similar measures will be taken that peasants with their carts and horses may meet with no hindrance on their return journey. (5) Steps will immediately be taken to re-establish ordinary trading.\n\nInhabitants of the city and villages, and you, workingmen and artisans, to whatever nation you belong, you are called on to carry out the paternal intentions of His Majesty the Emperor and King and to co-operate with him for the public welfare! Lay your respect and confidence at his feet and do not delay to unite with us!\n\n\nWith the object of raising the spirits of the troops and of the people, reviews were constantly held and rewards distributed. The Emperor rode through the streets to comfort the inhabitants, and, despite his preoccupation with state affairs, himself visited the theaters that were established by his order.\n\nIn regard to philanthropy, the greatest virtue of crowned heads, Napoleon also did all in his power. He caused the words Maison de ma M\u00e8re to be inscribed on the charitable institutions, thereby combining tender filial affection with the majestic benevolence of a monarch. He visited the Foundling Hospital and, allowing the orphans saved by him to kiss his white hands, graciously conversed with Tut\u00f3lmin. Then, as Thiers eloquently recounts, he ordered his soldiers to be paid in forged Russian money which he had prepared: \u201cRaising the use of these means by an act worthy of himself and of the French army, he let relief be distributed to those who had been burned out. But as food was too precious to be given to foreigners, who were for the most part enemies, Napoleon preferred to supply them with money with which to purchase food from outside, and had paper rubles distributed to them.\u201d\n\nWith reference to army discipline, orders were continually being issued to inflict severe punishment for the nonperformance of military duties and to suppress robbery.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nBut strange to say, all these measures, efforts, and plans\u2014which were not at all worse than others issued in similar circumstances\u2014did not affect the essence of the matter but, like the hands of a clock detached from the mechanism, swung about in an arbitrary and aimless way without engaging the cogwheels.\n\nWith reference to the military side\u2014the plan of campaign\u2014that work of genius of which Thiers remarks that, \u201cHis genius never devised anything more profound, more skillful, or more admirable,\u201d and enters into a polemic with M. Fain to prove that this work of genius must be referred not to the fourth but to the fifteenth of October\u2014that plan never was or could be executed, for it was quite out of touch with the facts of the case. The fortifying of the Kr\u00e9mlin, for which la Mosqu\u00e9e (as Napoleon termed the church of Basil the Beatified) was to have been razed to the ground, proved quite useless. The mining of the Kr\u00e9mlin only helped toward fulfilling Napoleon\u2019s wish that it should be blown up when he left Moscow\u2014as a child wants the floor on which he has hurt himself to be beaten. The pursuit of the Russian army, about which Napoleon was so concerned, produced an unheard-of result. The French generals lost touch with the Russian army of sixty thousand men, and according to Thiers it was only eventually found, like a lost pin, by the skill\u2014and apparently the genius\u2014of Murat.\n\nWith reference to diplomacy, all Napoleon\u2019s arguments as to his magnanimity and justice, both to Tut\u00f3lmin and to Y\u00e1kovlev (whose chief concern was to obtain a greatcoat and a conveyance), proved useless; Alexander did not receive these envoys and did not reply to their embassage.\n\nWith regard to legal matters, after the execution of the supposed incendiaries the rest of Moscow burned down.\n\nWith regard to administrative matters, the establishment of a municipality did not stop the robberies and was only of use to certain people who formed part of that municipality and under pretext of preserving order looted Moscow or saved their own property from being looted.\n\nWith regard to religion, as to which in Egypt matters had so easily been settled by Napoleon\u2019s visit to a mosque, no results were achieved. Two or three priests who were found in Moscow did try to carry out Napoleon\u2019s wish, but one of them was slapped in the face by a French soldier while conducting service, and a French official reported of another that: \u201cThe priest whom I found and invited to say Mass cleaned and locked up the church. That night the doors were again broken open, the padlocks smashed, the books mutilated, and other disorders perpetrated.\u201d\n\nWith reference to commerce, the proclamation to industrious workmen and to peasants evoked no response. There were no industrious workmen, and the peasants caught the commissaries who ventured too far out of town with the proclamation and killed them.\n\nAs to the theaters for the entertainment of the people and the troops, these did not meet with success either. The theaters set up in the Kr\u00e9mlin and in Posny\u00e1kov\u2019s house were closed again at once because the actors and actresses were robbed.\n\nEven philanthropy did not have the desired effect. The genuine as well as the false paper money which flooded Moscow lost its value. The French, collecting booty, cared only for gold. Not only was the paper money valueless which Napoleon so graciously distributed to the unfortunate, but even silver lost its value in relation to gold.\n\nBut the most amazing example of the ineffectiveness of the orders given by the authorities at that time was Napoleon\u2019s attempt to stop the looting and re-establish discipline.\n\nThis is what the army authorities were reporting:\n\n\u201cLooting continues in the city despite the decrees against it. Order is not yet restored and not a single merchant is carrying on trade in a lawful manner. The sutlers alone venture to trade, and they sell stolen goods.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe neighborhood of my ward continues to be pillaged by soldiers of the 3rd Corps who, not satisfied with taking from the unfortunate inhabitants hiding in the cellars the little they have left, even have the ferocity to wound them with their sabers, as I have repeatedly witnessed.\u201d\n\n\u201cNothing new, except that the soldiers are robbing and pillaging\u2014October 9.\u201d\n\n\u201cRobbery and pillaging continue. There is a band of thieves in our district who ought to be arrested by a strong force\u2014October 11.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Emperor is extremely displeased that despite the strict orders to stop pillage, parties of marauding Guards are continually seen returning to the Kr\u00e9mlin. Among the Old Guard disorder and pillage were renewed more violently than ever yesterday evening, last night, and today. The Emperor sees with regret that the picked soldiers appointed to guard his person, who should set an example of discipline, carry disobedience to such a point that they break into the cellars and stores containing army supplies. Others have disgraced themselves to the extent of disobeying sentinels and officers, and have abused and beaten them.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Grand Marshal of the palace,\u201d wrote the governor, \u201ccomplains bitterly that in spite of repeated orders, the soldiers continue to commit nuisances in all the courtyards and even under the very windows of the Emperor.\u201d\n\nThat army, like a herd of cattle run wild and trampling underfoot the provender which might have saved it from starvation, disintegrated and perished with each additional day it remained in Moscow. But it did not go away.\n\nIt began to run away only when suddenly seized by a panic caused by the capture of transport trains on the Smol\u00e9nsk road, and by the battle of Tar\u00fatino. The news of that battle of Tar\u00fatino, unexpectedly received by Napoleon at a review, evoked in him a desire to punish the Russians (Thiers says), and he issued the order for departure which the whole army was demanding.\n\nFleeing from Moscow the soldiers took with them everything they had stolen. Napoleon, too, carried away his own personal tr\u00e9sor, but on seeing the baggage trains that impeded the army, he was (Thiers says) horror-struck. And yet with his experience of war he did not order all the superfluous vehicles to be burned, as he had done with those of a certain marshal when approaching Moscow. He gazed at the cal\u00e8ches and carriages in which soldiers were riding and remarked that it was a very good thing, as those vehicles could be used to carry provisions, the sick, and the wounded.\n\nThe plight of the whole army resembled that of a wounded animal which feels it is perishing and does not know what it is doing. To study the skillful tactics and aims of Napoleon and his army from the time it entered Moscow till it was destroyed is like studying the dying leaps and shudders of a mortally wounded animal. Very often a wounded animal, hearing a rustle, rushes straight at the hunter\u2019s gun, runs forward and back again, and hastens its own end. Napoleon, under pressure from his whole army, did the same thing. The rustle of the battle of Tar\u00fatino frightened the beast, and it rushed forward onto the hunter\u2019s gun, reached him, turned back, and finally\u2014like any wild beast\u2014ran back along the most disadvantageous and dangerous path, where the old scent was familiar.\n\nDuring the whole of that period Napoleon, who seems to us to have been the leader of all these movements\u2014as the figurehead of a ship may seem to a savage to guide the vessel\u2014acted like a child who, holding a couple of strings inside a carriage, thinks he is driving it.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nEarly in the morning of the sixth of October Pierre went out of the shed, and on returning stopped by the door to play with a little blue-gray dog, with a long body and short bandy legs, that jumped about him. This little dog lived in their shed, sleeping beside Karat\u00e1ev at night; it sometimes made excursions into the town but always returned again. Probably it had never had an owner, and it still belonged to nobody and had no name. The French called it Azor; the soldier who told stories called it Femg\u00e1lka; Karat\u00e1ev and others called it Gray, or sometimes Flabby. Its lack of a master, a name, or even of a breed or any definite color did not seem to trouble the blue-gray dog in the least. Its furry tail stood up firm and round as a plume, its bandy legs served it so well that it would often gracefully lift a hind leg and run very easily and quickly on three legs, as if disdaining to use all four. Everything pleased it. Now it would roll on its back, yelping with delight, now bask in the sun with a thoughtful air of importance, and now frolic about playing with a chip of wood or a straw.\n\nPierre\u2019s attire by now consisted of a dirty torn shirt (the only remnant of his former clothing), a pair of soldier\u2019s trousers which by Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s advice he tied with string round the ankles for warmth, and a peasant coat and cap. Physically he had changed much during this time. He no longer seemed stout, though he still had the appearance of solidity and strength hereditary in his family. A beard and mustache covered the lower part of his face, and a tangle of hair, infested with lice, curled round his head like a cap. The look of his eyes was resolute, calm, and animatedly alert, as never before. The former slackness which had shown itself even in his eyes was now replaced by an energetic readiness for action and resistance. His feet were bare.\n\nPierre first looked down the field across which vehicles and horsemen were passing that morning, then into the distance across the river, then at the dog who was pretending to be in earnest about biting him, and then at his bare feet which he placed with pleasure in various positions, moving his dirty thick big toes. Every time he looked at his bare feet a smile of animated self-satisfaction flitted across his face. The sight of them reminded him of all he had experienced and learned during these weeks and this recollection was pleasant to him.\n\nFor some days the weather had been calm and clear with slight frosts in the mornings\u2014what is called an \u201cold wives\u2019 summer.\u201d\n\nIn the sunshine the air was warm, and that warmth was particularly pleasant with the invigorating freshness of the morning frost still in the air.\n\nOn everything\u2014far and near\u2014lay the magic crystal glitter seen only at that time of autumn. The Sparrow Hills were visible in the distance, with the village, the church, and the large white house. The bare trees, the sand, the bricks and roofs of the houses, the green church spire, and the corners of the white house in the distance, all stood out in the transparent air in most delicate outline and with unnatural clearness. Near by could be seen the familiar ruins of a half-burned mansion occupied by the French, with lilac bushes still showing dark green beside the fence. And even that ruined and befouled house\u2014which in dull weather was repulsively ugly\u2014seemed quietly beautiful now, in the clear, motionless brilliance.\n\nA French corporal, with coat unbuttoned in a homely way, a skullcap on his head, and a short pipe in his mouth, came from behind a corner of the shed and approached Pierre with a friendly wink.\n\n\u201cWhat sunshine, Monsieur Kiril!\u201d (Their name for Pierre.) \u201cEh? Just like spring!\u201d\n\nAnd the corporal leaned against the door and offered Pierre his pipe, though whenever he offered it Pierre always declined it.\n\n\u201cTo be on the march in such weather...\u201d he began.\n\nPierre inquired what was being said about leaving, and the corporal told him that nearly all the troops were starting and there ought to be an order about the prisoners that day. Sokol\u00f3v, one of the soldiers in the shed with Pierre, was dying, and Pierre told the corporal that something should be done about him. The corporal replied that Pierre need not worry about that as they had an ambulance and a permanent hospital and arrangements would be made for the sick, and that in general everything that could happen had been foreseen by the authorities.\n\n\u201cBesides, Monsieur Kiril, you have only to say a word to the captain, you know. He is a man who never forgets anything. Speak to the captain when he makes his round, he will do anything for you.\u201d\n\n(The captain of whom the corporal spoke often had long chats with Pierre and showed him all sorts of favors.)\n\n\u201c\u2018You see, St. Thomas,\u2019 he said to me the other day. \u2018Monsieur Kiril is a man of education, who speaks French. He is a Russian seigneur who has had misfortunes, but he is a man. He knows what\u2019s what.... If he wants anything and asks me, he won\u2019t get a refusal. When one has studied, you see, one likes education and well-bred people.\u2019 It is for your sake I mention it, Monsieur Kiril. The other day if it had not been for you that affair would have ended ill.\u201d\n\nAnd after chatting a while longer, the corporal went away. (The affair he had alluded to had happened a few days before\u2014a fight between the prisoners and the French soldiers, in which Pierre had succeeded in pacifying his comrades.) Some of the prisoners who had heard Pierre talking to the corporal immediately asked what the Frenchman had said. While Pierre was repeating what he had been told about the army leaving Moscow, a thin, sallow, tattered French soldier came up to the door of the shed. Rapidly and timidly raising his fingers to his forehead by way of greeting, he asked Pierre whether the soldier Platoche to whom he had given a shirt to sew was in that shed.\n\nA week before the French had had boot leather and linen issued to them, which they had given out to the prisoners to make up into boots and shirts for them.\n\n\u201cReady, ready, dear fellow!\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev, coming out with a neatly folded shirt.\n\nKarat\u00e1ev, on account of the warm weather and for convenience at work, was wearing only trousers and a tattered shirt as black as soot. His hair was bound round, workman fashion, with a wisp of lime-tree bast, and his round face seemed rounder and pleasanter than ever.\n\n\u201cA promise is own brother to performance! I said Friday and here it is, ready,\u201d said Plat\u00f3n, smiling and unfolding the shirt he had sewn.\n\nThe Frenchman glanced around uneasily and then, as if overcoming his hesitation, rapidly threw off his uniform and put on the shirt. He had a long, greasy, flowered silk waistcoat next to his sallow, thin bare body, but no shirt. He was evidently afraid the prisoners looking on would laugh at him, and thrust his head into the shirt hurriedly. None of the prisoners said a word.\n\n\u201cSee, it fits well!\u201d Plat\u00f3n kept repeating, pulling the shirt straight.\n\nThe Frenchman, having pushed his head and hands through, without raising his eyes, looked down at the shirt and examined the seams.\n\n\u201cYou see, dear man, this is not a sewing shop, and I had no proper tools; and, as they say, one needs a tool even to kill a louse,\u201d said Plat\u00f3n with one of his round smiles, obviously pleased with his work.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good, quite good, thank you,\u201d said the Frenchman, in French, \u201cbut there must be some linen left over.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will fit better still when it sets to your body,\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev, still admiring his handiwork. \u201cYou\u2019ll be nice and comfortable....\u201d\n\n\u201cThanks, thanks, old fellow.... But the bits left over?\u201d said the Frenchman again and smiled. He took out an assignation ruble note and gave it to Karat\u00e1ev. \u201cBut give me the pieces that are over.\u201d\n\nPierre saw that Plat\u00f3n did not want to understand what the Frenchman was saying, and he looked on without interfering. Karat\u00e1ev thanked the Frenchman for the money and went on admiring his own work. The Frenchman insisted on having the pieces returned that were left over and asked Pierre to translate what he said.\n\n\u201cWhat does he want the bits for?\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev. \u201cThey\u2019d make fine leg bands for us. Well, never mind.\u201d\n\nAnd Karat\u00e1ev, with a suddenly changed and saddened expression, took a small bundle of scraps from inside his shirt and gave it to the Frenchman without looking at him. \u201cOh dear!\u201d muttered Karat\u00e1ev and went away. The Frenchman looked at the linen, considered for a moment, then looked inquiringly at Pierre and, as if Pierre\u2019s look had told him something, suddenly blushed and shouted in a squeaky voice:\n\n\u201cPlatoche! Eh, Platoche! Keep them yourself!\u201d And handing back the odd bits he turned and went out.\n\n\u201cThere, look at that,\u201d said Karat\u00e1ev, swaying his head. \u201cPeople said they were not Christians, but they too have souls. It\u2019s what the old folk used to say: \u2018A sweating hand\u2019s an open hand, a dry hand\u2019s close.\u2019 He\u2019s naked, but yet he\u2019s given it back.\u201d\n\nKarat\u00e1ev smiled thoughtfully and was silent awhile looking at the pieces.\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019ll make grand leg bands, dear friend,\u201d he said, and went back into the shed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFour weeks had passed since Pierre had been taken prisoner and though the French had offered to move him from the men\u2019s to the officers\u2019 shed, he had stayed in the shed where he was first put.\n\nIn burned and devastated Moscow Pierre experienced almost the extreme limits of privation a man can endure; but thanks to his physical strength and health, of which he had till then been unconscious, and thanks especially to the fact that the privations came so gradually that it was impossible to say when they began, he endured his position not only lightly but joyfully. And just at this time he obtained the tranquillity and ease of mind he had formerly striven in vain to reach. He had long sought in different ways that tranquillity of mind, that inner harmony which had so impressed him in the soldiers at the battle of Borodin\u00f3. He had sought it in philanthropy, in Freemasonry, in the dissipations of town life, in wine, in heroic feats of self-sacrifice, and in romantic love for Nat\u00e1sha; he had sought it by reasoning\u2014and all these quests and experiments had failed him. And now without thinking about it he had found that peace and inner harmony only through the horror of death, through privation, and through what he recognized in Karat\u00e1ev.\n\nThose dreadful moments he had lived through at the executions had as it were forever washed away from his imagination and memory the agitating thoughts and feelings that had formerly seemed so important. It did not now occur to him to think of Russia, or the war, or politics, or Napoleon. It was plain to him that all these things were no business of his, and that he was not called on to judge concerning them and therefore could not do so. \u201cRussia and summer weather are not bound together,\u201d he thought, repeating words of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s which he found strangely consoling. His intention of killing Napoleon and his calculations of the cabalistic number of the beast of the Apocalypse now seemed to him meaningless and even ridiculous. His anger with his wife and anxiety that his name should not be smirched now seemed not merely trivial but even amusing. What concern was it of his that somewhere or other that woman was leading the life she preferred? What did it matter to anybody, and especially to him, whether or not they found out that their prisoner\u2019s name was Count Bez\u00fakhov?\n\nHe now often remembered his conversation with Prince Andrew and quite agreed with him, though he understood Prince Andrew\u2019s thoughts somewhat differently. Prince Andrew had thought and said that happiness could only be negative, but had said it with a shade of bitterness and irony as though he was really saying that all desire for positive happiness is implanted in us merely to torment us and never be satisfied. But Pierre believed it without any mental reservation. The absence of suffering, the satisfaction of one\u2019s needs and consequent freedom in the choice of one\u2019s occupation, that is, of one\u2019s way of life, now seemed to Pierre to be indubitably man\u2019s highest happiness. Here and now for the first time he fully appreciated the enjoyment of eating when he wanted to eat, drinking when he wanted to drink, sleeping when he wanted to sleep, of warmth when he was cold, of talking to a fellow man when he wished to talk and to hear a human voice. The satisfaction of one\u2019s needs\u2014good food, cleanliness, and freedom\u2014now that he was deprived of all this, seemed to Pierre to constitute perfect happiness; and the choice of occupation, that is, of his way of life\u2014now that that was so restricted\u2014seemed to him such an easy matter that he forgot that a superfluity of the comforts of life destroys all joy in satisfying one\u2019s needs, while great freedom in the choice of occupation\u2014such freedom as his wealth, his education, and his social position had given him in his own life\u2014is just what makes the choice of occupation insolubly difficult and destroys the desire and possibility of having an occupation.\n\nAll Pierre\u2019s daydreams now turned on the time when he would be free. Yet subsequently, and for the rest of his life, he thought and spoke with enthusiasm of that month of captivity, of those irrecoverable, strong, joyful sensations, and chiefly of the complete peace of mind and inner freedom which he experienced only during those weeks.\n\nWhen on the first day he got up early, went out of the shed at dawn, and saw the cupolas and crosses of the New Convent of the Virgin still dark at first, the hoarfrost on the dusty grass, the Sparrow Hills, and the wooded banks above the winding river vanishing in the purple distance, when he felt the contact of the fresh air and heard the noise of the crows flying from Moscow across the field, and when afterwards light gleamed from the east and the sun\u2019s rim appeared solemnly from behind a cloud, and the cupolas and crosses, the hoarfrost, the distance and the river, all began to sparkle in the glad light\u2014Pierre felt a new joy and strength in life such as he had never before known. And this not only stayed with him during the whole of his imprisonment, but even grew in strength as the hardships of his position increased.\n\nThat feeling of alertness and of readiness for anything was still further strengthened in him by the high opinion his fellow prisoners formed of him soon after his arrival at the shed. With his knowledge of languages, the respect shown him by the French, his simplicity, his readiness to give anything asked of him (he received the allowance of three rubles a week made to officers); with his strength, which he showed to the soldiers by pressing nails into the walls of the hut; his gentleness to his companions, and his capacity for sitting still and thinking without doing anything (which seemed to them incomprehensible), he appeared to them a rather mysterious and superior being. The very qualities that had been a hindrance, if not actually harmful, to him in the world he had lived in\u2014his strength, his disdain for the comforts of life, his absent-mindedness and simplicity\u2014here among these people gave him almost the status of a hero. And Pierre felt that their opinion placed responsibilities upon him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nThe French evacuation began on the night between the sixth and seventh of October: kitchens and sheds were dismantled, carts loaded, and troops and baggage trains started.\n\nAt seven in the morning a French convoy in marching trim, wearing shakos and carrying muskets, knapsacks, and enormous sacks, stood in front of the sheds, and animated French talk mingled with curses sounded all along the lines.\n\nIn the shed everyone was ready, dressed, belted, shod, and only awaited the order to start. The sick soldier, Sokol\u00f3v, pale and thin with dark shadows round his eyes, alone sat in his place barefoot and not dressed. His eyes, prominent from the emaciation of his face, gazed inquiringly at his comrades who were paying no attention to him, and he moaned regularly and quietly. It was evidently not so much his sufferings that caused him to moan (he had dysentery) as his fear and grief at being left alone.\n\nPierre, girt with a rope round his waist and wearing shoes Karat\u00e1ev had made for him from some leather a French soldier had torn off a tea chest and brought to have his boots mended with, went up to the sick man and squatted down beside him.\n\n\u201cYou know, Sokol\u00f3v, they are not all going away! They have a hospital here. You may be better off than we others,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cO Lord! Oh, it will be the death of me! O Lord!\u201d moaned the man in a louder voice.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll go and ask them again directly,\u201d said Pierre, rising and going to the door of the shed.\n\nJust as Pierre reached the door, the corporal who had offered him a pipe the day before came up to it with two soldiers. The corporal and soldiers were in marching kit with knapsacks and shakos that had metal straps, and these changed their familiar faces.\n\nThe corporal came, according to orders, to shut the door. The prisoners had to be counted before being let out.\n\n\u201cCorporal, what will they do with the sick man?...\u201d Pierre began.\n\nBut even as he spoke he began to doubt whether this was the corporal he knew or a stranger, so unlike himself did the corporal seem at that moment. Moreover, just as Pierre was speaking a sharp rattle of drums was suddenly heard from both sides. The corporal frowned at Pierre\u2019s words and, uttering some meaningless oaths, slammed the door. The shed became semidark, and the sharp rattle of the drums on two sides drowned the sick man\u2019s groans.\n\n\u201cThere it is!... It again!...\u201d said Pierre to himself, and an involuntary shudder ran down his spine. In the corporal\u2019s changed face, in the sound of his voice, in the stirring and deafening noise of the drums, he recognized that mysterious, callous force which compelled people against their will to kill their fellow men\u2014that force the effect of which he had witnessed during the executions. To fear or to try to escape that force, to address entreaties or exhortations to those who served as its tools, was useless. Pierre knew this now. One had to wait and endure. He did not again go to the sick man, nor turn to look at him, but stood frowning by the door of the hut.\n\nWhen that door was opened and the prisoners, crowding against one another like a flock of sheep, squeezed into the exit, Pierre pushed his way forward and approached that very captain who as the corporal had assured him was ready to do anything for him. The captain was also in marching kit, and on his cold face appeared that same it which Pierre had recognized in the corporal\u2019s words and in the roll of the drums.\n\n\u201cPass on, pass on!\u201d the captain reiterated, frowning sternly, and looking at the prisoners who thronged past him.\n\nPierre went up to him, though he knew his attempt would be vain.\n\n\u201cWhat now?\u201d the officer asked with a cold look as if not recognizing Pierre.\n\nPierre told him about the sick man.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll manage to walk, devil take him!\u201d said the captain. \u201cPass on, pass on!\u201d he continued without looking at Pierre.\n\n\u201cBut he is dying,\u201d Pierre again began.\n\n\u201cBe so good...\u201d shouted the captain, frowning angrily.\n\n\u201cDram-da-da-dam, dam-dam...\u201d rattled the drums, and Pierre understood that this mysterious force completely controlled these men and that it was now useless to say any more.\n\nThe officer prisoners were separated from the soldiers and told to march in front. There were about thirty officers, with Pierre among them, and about three hundred men.\n\nThe officers, who had come from the other sheds, were all strangers to Pierre and much better dressed than he. They looked at him and at his shoes mistrustfully, as at an alien. Not far from him walked a fat major with a sallow, bloated, angry face, who was wearing a Kaz\u00e1n dressing gown tied round with a towel, and who evidently enjoyed the respect of his fellow prisoners. He kept one hand, in which he clasped his tobacco pouch, inside the bosom of his dressing gown and held the stem of his pipe firmly with the other. Panting and puffing, the major grumbled and growled at everybody because he thought he was being pushed and that they were all hurrying when they had nowhere to hurry to and were all surprised at something when there was nothing to be surprised at. Another, a thin little officer, was speaking to everyone, conjecturing where they were now being taken and how far they would get that day. An official in felt boots and wearing a commissariat uniform ran round from side to side and gazed at the ruins of Moscow, loudly announcing his observations as to what had been burned down and what this or that part of the city was that they could see. A third officer, who by his accent was a Pole, disputed with the commissariat officer, arguing that he was mistaken in his identification of the different wards of Moscow.\n\n\u201cWhat are you disputing about?\u201d said the major angrily. \u201cWhat does it matter whether it is St. Nicholas or St. Blasius? You see it\u2019s burned down, and there\u2019s an end of it.... What are you pushing for? Isn\u2019t the road wide enough?\u201d said he, turning to a man behind him who was not pushing him at all.\n\n\u201cOh, oh, oh! What have they done?\u201d the prisoners on one side and another were heard saying as they gazed on the charred ruins. \u201cAll beyond the river, and Z\u00fabova, and in the Kr\u00e9mlin.... Just look! There\u2019s not half of it left. Yes, I told you\u2014the whole quarter beyond the river, and so it is.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know it\u2019s burned, so what\u2019s the use of talking?\u201d said the major.\n\nAs they passed near a church in the Kham\u00f3vniki (one of the few unburned quarters of Moscow) the whole mass of prisoners suddenly started to one side and exclamations of horror and disgust were heard.\n\n\u201cAh, the villains! What heathens! Yes; dead, dead, so he is... And smeared with something!\u201d\n\nPierre too drew near the church where the thing was that evoked these exclamations, and dimly made out something leaning against the palings surrounding the church. From the words of his comrades who saw better than he did, he found that this was the body of a man, set upright against the palings with its face smeared with soot.\n\n\u201cGo on! What the devil... Go on! Thirty thousand devils!...\u201d the convoy guards began cursing and the French soldiers, with fresh virulence, drove away with their swords the crowd of prisoners who were gazing at the dead man.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nThrough the cross streets of the Kham\u00f3vniki quarter the prisoners marched, followed only by their escort and the vehicles and wagons belonging to that escort, but when they reached the supply stores they came among a huge and closely packed train of artillery mingled with private vehicles.\n\nAt the bridge they all halted, waiting for those in front to get across. From the bridge they had a view of endless lines of moving baggage trains before and behind them. To the right, where the Kal\u00faga road turns near Nesk\u00fachny, endless rows of troops and carts stretched away into the distance. These were troops of Beauharnais\u2019 corps which had started before any of the others. Behind, along the riverside and across the Stone Bridge, were Ney\u2019s troops and transport.\n\nDavout\u2019s troops, in whose charge were the prisoners, were crossing the Crimean bridge and some were already debouching into the Kal\u00faga road. But the baggage trains stretched out so that the last of Beauharnais\u2019 train had not yet got out of Moscow and reached the Kal\u00faga road when the vanguard of Ney\u2019s army was already emerging from the Great Ord\u00fdnka Street.\n\nWhen they had crossed the Crimean bridge the prisoners moved a few steps forward, halted, and again moved on, and from all sides vehicles and men crowded closer and closer together. They advanced the few hundred paces that separated the bridge from the Kal\u00faga road, taking more than an hour to do so, and came out upon the square where the streets of the Transmoskv\u00e1 ward and the Kal\u00faga road converge, and the prisoners jammed close together had to stand for some hours at that crossway. From all sides, like the roar of the sea, were heard the rattle of wheels, the tramp of feet, and incessant shouts of anger and abuse. Pierre stood pressed against the wall of a charred house, listening to that noise which mingled in his imagination with the roll of the drums.\n\nTo get a better view, several officer prisoners climbed onto the wall of the half-burned house against which Pierre was leaning.\n\n\u201cWhat crowds! Just look at the crowds!... They\u2019ve loaded goods even on the cannon! Look there, those are furs!\u201d they exclaimed. \u201cJust see what the blackguards have looted.... There! See what that one has behind in the cart.... Why, those are settings taken from some icons, by heaven!... Oh, the rascals!... See how that fellow has loaded himself up, he can hardly walk! Good lord, they\u2019ve even grabbed those chaises!... See that fellow there sitting on the trunks.... Heavens! They\u2019re fighting.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right, hit him on the snout\u2014on his snout! Like this, we shan\u2019t get away before evening. Look, look there.... Why, that must be Napoleon\u2019s own. See what horses! And the monograms with a crown! It\u2019s like a portable house.... That fellow\u2019s dropped his sack and doesn\u2019t see it. Fighting again... A woman with a baby, and not bad-looking either! Yes, I dare say, that\u2019s the way they\u2019ll let you pass.... Just look, there\u2019s no end to it. Russian wenches, by heaven, so they are! In carriages\u2014see how comfortably they\u2019ve settled themselves!\u201d\n\nAgain, as at the church in Kham\u00f3vniki, a wave of general curiosity bore all the prisoners forward onto the road, and Pierre, thanks to his stature, saw over the heads of the others what so attracted their curiosity. In three carriages involved among the munition carts, closely squeezed together, sat women with rouged faces, dressed in glaring colors, who were shouting something in shrill voices.\n\nFrom the moment Pierre had recognized the appearance of the mysterious force nothing had seemed to him strange or dreadful: neither the corpse smeared with soot for fun nor these women hurrying away nor the burned ruins of Moscow. All that he now witnessed scarcely made an impression on him\u2014as if his soul, making ready for a hard struggle, refused to receive impressions that might weaken it.\n\nThe women\u2019s vehicles drove by. Behind them came more carts, soldiers, wagons, soldiers, gun carriages, carriages, soldiers, ammunition carts, more soldiers, and now and then women.\n\nPierre did not see the people as individuals but saw their movement.\n\nAll these people and horses seemed driven forward by some invisible power. During the hour Pierre watched them they all came flowing from the different streets with one and the same desire to get on quickly; they all jostled one another, began to grow angry and to fight, white teeth gleamed, brows frowned, ever the same words of abuse flew from side to side, and all the faces bore the same swaggeringly resolute and coldly cruel expression that had struck Pierre that morning on the corporal\u2019s face when the drums were beating.\n\nIt was not till nearly evening that the officer commanding the escort collected his men and with shouts and quarrels forced his way in among the baggage trains, and the prisoners, hemmed in on all sides, emerged onto the Kal\u00faga road.\n\nThey marched very quickly, without resting, and halted only when the sun began to set. The baggage carts drew up close together and the men began to prepare for their night\u2019s rest. They all appeared angry and dissatisfied. For a long time, oaths, angry shouts, and fighting could be heard from all sides. A carriage that followed the escort ran into one of the carts and knocked a hole in it with its pole. Several soldiers ran toward the cart from different sides: some beat the carriage horses on their heads, turning them aside, others fought among themselves, and Pierre saw that one German was badly wounded on the head by a sword.\n\nIt seemed that all these men, now that they had stopped amid fields in the chill dusk of the autumn evening, experienced one and the same feeling of unpleasant awakening from the hurry and eagerness to push on that had seized them at the start. Once at a standstill they all seemed to understand that they did not yet know where they were going, and that much that was painful and difficult awaited them on this journey.\n\nDuring this halt the escort treated the prisoners even worse than they had done at the start. It was here that the prisoners for the first time received horseflesh for their meat ration.\n\nFrom the officer down to the lowest soldier they showed what seemed like personal spite against each of the prisoners, in unexpected contrast to their former friendly relations.\n\nThis spite increased still more when, on calling over the roll of prisoners, it was found that in the bustle of leaving Moscow one Russian soldier, who had pretended to suffer from colic, had escaped. Pierre saw a Frenchman beat a Russian soldier cruelly for straying too far from the road, and heard his friend the captain reprimand and threaten to court-martial a noncommissioned officer on account of the escape of the Russian. To the noncommissioned officer\u2019s excuse that the prisoner was ill and could not walk, the officer replied that the order was to shoot those who lagged behind. Pierre felt that that fatal force which had crushed him during the executions, but which he had not felt during his imprisonment, now again controlled his existence. It was terrible, but he felt that in proportion to the efforts of that fatal force to crush him, there grew and strengthened in his soul a power of life independent of it.\n\nHe ate his supper of buckwheat soup with horseflesh and chatted with his comrades.\n\nNeither Pierre nor any of the others spoke of what they had seen in Moscow, or of the roughness of their treatment by the French, or of the order to shoot them which had been announced to them. As if in reaction against the worsening of their position they were all particularly animated and gay. They spoke of personal reminiscences, of amusing scenes they had witnessed during the campaign, and avoided all talk of their present situation.\n\nThe sun had set long since. Bright stars shone out here and there in the sky. A red glow as of a conflagration spread above the horizon from the rising full moon, and that vast red ball swayed strangely in the gray haze. It grew light. The evening was ending, but the night had not yet come. Pierre got up and left his new companions, crossing between the campfires to the other side of the road where he had been told the common soldier prisoners were stationed. He wanted to talk to them. On the road he was stopped by a French sentinel who ordered him back.\n\nPierre turned back, not to his companions by the campfire, but to an unharnessed cart where there was nobody. Tucking his legs under him and dropping his head he sat down on the cold ground by the wheel of the cart and remained motionless a long while sunk in thought. Suddenly he burst out into a fit of his broad, good-natured laughter, so loud that men from various sides turned with surprise to see what this strange and evidently solitary laughter could mean.\n\n\u201cHa-ha-ha!\u201d laughed Pierre. And he said aloud to himself: \u201cThe soldier did not let me pass. They took me and shut me up. They hold me captive. What, me? Me? My immortal soul? Ha-ha-ha! Ha-ha-ha!...\u201d and he laughed till tears started to his eyes.\n\nA man got up and came to see what this queer big fellow was laughing at all by himself. Pierre stopped laughing, got up, went farther away from the inquisitive man, and looked around him.\n\nThe huge, endless bivouac that had previously resounded with the crackling of campfires and the voices of many men had grown quiet, the red campfires were growing paler and dying down. High up in the light sky hung the full moon. Forests and fields beyond the camp, unseen before, were now visible in the distance. And farther still, beyond those forests and fields, the bright, oscillating, limitless distance lured one to itself. Pierre glanced up at the sky and the twinkling stars in its faraway depths. \u201cAnd all that is me, all that is within me, and it is all I!\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cAnd they caught all that and put it into a shed boarded up with planks!\u201d He smiled, and went and lay down to sleep beside his companions.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nIn the early days of October another envoy came to Kut\u00fazov with a letter from Napoleon proposing peace and falsely dated from Moscow, though Napoleon was already not far from Kut\u00fazov on the old Kal\u00faga road. Kut\u00fazov replied to this letter as he had done to the one formerly brought by Lauriston, saying that there could be no question of peace.\n\nSoon after that a report was received from D\u00f3rokhov\u2019s guerrilla detachment operating to the left of Tar\u00fatino that troops of Broussier\u2019s division had been seen at Form\u00ednsk and that being separated from the rest of the French army they might easily be destroyed. The soldiers and officers again demanded action. Generals on the staff, excited by the memory of the easy victory at Tar\u00fatino, urged Kut\u00fazov to carry out D\u00f3rokhov\u2019s suggestion. Kut\u00fazov did not consider any offensive necessary. The result was a compromise which was inevitable: a small detachment was sent to Form\u00ednsk to attack Broussier.\n\nBy a strange coincidence, this task, which turned out to be a most difficult and important one, was entrusted to Dokht\u00farov\u2014that same modest little Dokht\u00farov whom no one had described to us as drawing up plans of battles, dashing about in front of regiments, showering crosses on batteries, and so on, and who was thought to be and was spoken of as undecided and undiscerning\u2014but whom we find commanding wherever the position was most difficult all through the Russo-French wars from Austerlitz to the year 1813. At Austerlitz he remained last at the Augezd dam, rallying the regiments, saving what was possible when all were flying and perishing and not a single general was left in the rear guard. Ill with fever he went to Smol\u00e9nsk with twenty thousand men to defend the town against Napoleon\u2019s whole army. In Smol\u00e9nsk, at the Mal\u00e1khov Gate, he had hardly dozed off in a paroxysm of fever before he was awakened by the bombardment of the town\u2014and Smol\u00e9nsk held out all day long. At the battle of Borodin\u00f3, when Bagrati\u00f3n was killed and nine tenths of the men of our left flank had fallen and the full force of the French artillery fire was directed against it, the man sent there was this same irresolute and undiscerning Dokht\u00farov\u2014Kut\u00fazov hastening to rectify a mistake he had made by sending someone else there first. And the quiet little Dokht\u00farov rode thither, and Borodin\u00f3 became the greatest glory of the Russian army. Many heroes have been described to us in verse and prose, but of Dokht\u00farov scarcely a word has been said.\n\nIt was Dokht\u00farov again whom they sent to Form\u00ednsk and from there to M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets, the place where the last battle with the French was fought and where the obvious disintegration of the French army began; and we are told of many geniuses and heroes of that period of the campaign, but of Dokht\u00farov nothing or very little is said and that dubiously. And this silence about Dokht\u00farov is the clearest testimony to his merit.\n\nIt is natural for a man who does not understand the workings of a machine to imagine that a shaving that has fallen into it by chance and is interfering with its action and tossing about in it is its most important part. The man who does not understand the construction of the machine cannot conceive that the small connecting cogwheel which revolves quietly is one of the most essential parts of the machine, and not the shaving which merely harms and hinders the working.\n\nOn the tenth of October when Dokht\u00farov had gone halfway to Form\u00ednsk and stopped at the village of Arist\u00f3vo, preparing faithfully to execute the orders he had received, the whole French army having, in its convulsive movement, reached Murat\u2019s position apparently in order to give battle\u2014suddenly without any reason turned off to the left onto the new Kal\u00faga road and began to enter Form\u00ednsk, where only Broussier had been till then. At that time Dokht\u00farov had under his command, besides D\u00f3rokhov\u2019s detachment, the two small guerrilla detachments of Figner and Sesl\u00e1vin.\n\nOn the evening of October 11 Sesl\u00e1vin came to the Arist\u00f3vo headquarters with a French guardsman he had captured. The prisoner said that the troops that had entered Form\u00ednsk that day were the vanguard of the whole army, that Napoleon was there and the whole army had left Moscow four days previously. That same evening a house serf who had come from B\u00f3rovsk said he had seen an immense army entering the town. Some Cossacks of Dokht\u00farov\u2019s detachment reported having sighted the French Guards marching along the road to B\u00f3rovsk. From all these reports it was evident that where they had expected to meet a single division there was now the whole French army marching from Moscow in an unexpected direction\u2014along the Kal\u00faga road. Dokht\u00farov was unwilling to undertake any action, as it was not clear to him now what he ought to do. He had been ordered to attack Form\u00ednsk. But only Broussier had been there at that time and now the whole French army was there. Erm\u00f3lov wished to act on his own judgment, but Dokht\u00farov insisted that he must have Kut\u00fazov\u2019s instructions. So it was decided to send a dispatch to the staff.\n\nFor this purpose a capable officer, Bolkhov\u00edtinov, was chosen, who was to explain the whole affair by word of mouth, besides delivering a written report. Toward midnight Bolkhov\u00edtinov, having received the dispatch and verbal instructions, galloped off to the General Staff accompanied by a Cossack with spare horses.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nIt was a warm, dark, autumn night. It had been raining for four days. Having changed horses twice and galloped twenty miles in an hour and a half over a sticky, muddy road, Bolkhov\u00edtinov reached Litash\u00ebvka after one o\u2019clock at night. Dismounting at a cottage on whose wattle fence hung a signboard, GENERAL STAFF, and throwing down his reins, he entered a dark passage.\n\n\u201cThe general on duty, quick! It\u2019s very important!\u201d said he to someone who had risen and was sniffing in the dark passage.\n\n\u201cHe has been very unwell since the evening and this is the third night he has not slept,\u201d said the orderly pleadingly in a whisper. \u201cYou should wake the captain first.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut this is very important, from General Dokht\u00farov,\u201d said Bolkhov\u00edtinov, entering the open door which he had found by feeling in the dark.\n\nThe orderly had gone in before him and began waking somebody.\n\n\u201cYour honor, your honor! A courier.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat? What\u2019s that? From whom?\u201d came a sleepy voice.\n\n\u201cFrom Dokht\u00farov and from Alex\u00e9y Petr\u00f3vich. Napoleon is at Form\u00ednsk,\u201d said Bolkhov\u00edtinov, unable to see in the dark who was speaking but guessing by the voice that it was not Konovn\u00edtsyn.\n\nThe man who had wakened yawned and stretched himself.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like waking him,\u201d he said, fumbling for something. \u201cHe is very ill. Perhaps this is only a rumor.\u201d\n\n\u201cHere is the dispatch,\u201d said Bolkhov\u00edtinov. \u201cMy orders are to give it at once to the general on duty.\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a moment, I\u2019ll light a candle. You damned rascal, where do you always hide it?\u201d said the voice of the man who was stretching himself, to the orderly. (This was Shcherb\u00ednin, Konovn\u00edtsyn\u2019s adjutant.) \u201cI\u2019ve found it, I\u2019ve found it!\u201d he added.\n\nThe orderly was striking a light and Shcherb\u00ednin was fumbling for something on the candlestick.\n\n\u201cOh, the nasty beasts!\u201d said he with disgust.\n\nBy the light of the sparks Bolkhov\u00edtinov saw Shcherb\u00ednin\u2019s youthful face as he held the candle, and the face of another man who was still asleep. This was Konovn\u00edtsyn.\n\nWhen the flame of the sulphur splinters kindled by the tinder burned up, first blue and then red, Shcherb\u00ednin lit the tallow candle, from the candlestick of which the cockroaches that had been gnawing it were running away, and looked at the messenger. Bolkhov\u00edtinov was bespattered all over with mud and had smeared his face by wiping it with his sleeve.\n\n\u201cWho gave the report?\u201d inquired Shcherb\u00ednin, taking the envelope.\n\n\u201cThe news is reliable,\u201d said Bolkhov\u00edtinov. \u201cPrisoners, Cossacks, and the scouts all say the same thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be done, we\u2019ll have to wake him,\u201d said Shcherb\u00ednin, rising and going up to the man in the nightcap who lay covered by a greatcoat. \u201cPeter Petr\u00f3vich!\u201d said he. (Konovn\u00edtsyn did not stir.) \u201cTo the General Staff!\u201d he said with a smile, knowing that those words would be sure to arouse him.\n\nAnd in fact the head in the nightcap was lifted at once. On Konovn\u00edtsyn\u2019s handsome, resolute face with cheeks flushed by fever, there still remained for an instant a faraway dreamy expression remote from present affairs, but then he suddenly started and his face assumed its habitual calm and firm appearance.\n\n\u201cWell, what is it? From whom?\u201d he asked immediately but without hurry, blinking at the light.\n\nWhile listening to the officer\u2019s report Konovn\u00edtsyn broke the seal and read the dispatch. Hardly had he done so before he lowered his legs in their woolen stockings to the earthen floor and began putting on his boots. Then he took off his nightcap, combed his hair over his temples, and donned his cap.\n\n\u201cDid you get here quickly? Let us go to his Highness.\u201d\n\nKonovn\u00edtsyn had understood at once that the news brought was of great importance and that no time must be lost. He did not consider or ask himself whether the news was good or bad. That did not interest him. He regarded the whole business of the war not with his intelligence or his reason but by something else. There was within him a deep unexpressed conviction that all would be well, but that one must not trust to this and still less speak about it, but must only attend to one\u2019s own work. And he did his work, giving his whole strength to the task.\n\nPeter Petr\u00f3vich Konovn\u00edtsyn, like Dokht\u00farov, seems to have been included merely for propriety\u2019s sake in the list of the so-called heroes of 1812\u2014the Barclays, Ra\u00e9vskis, Erm\u00f3lovs, Pl\u00e1tovs, and Milor\u00e1doviches. Like Dokht\u00farov he had the reputation of being a man of very limited capacity and information, and like Dokht\u00farov he never made plans of battle but was always found where the situation was most difficult. Since his appointment as general on duty he had always slept with his door open, giving orders that every messenger should be allowed to wake him up. In battle he was always under fire, so that Kut\u00fazov reproved him for it and feared to send him to the front, and like Dokht\u00farov he was one of those unnoticed cogwheels that, without clatter or noise, constitute the most essential part of the machine.\n\nComing out of the hut into the damp, dark night Konovn\u00edtsyn frowned\u2014partly from an increased pain in his head and partly at the unpleasant thought that occurred to him, of how all that nest of influential men on the staff would be stirred up by this news, especially Bennigsen, who ever since Tar\u00fatino had been at daggers drawn with Kut\u00fazov; and how they would make suggestions, quarrel, issue orders, and rescind them. And this premonition was disagreeable to him though he knew it could not be helped.\n\nAnd in fact Toll, to whom he went to communicate the news, immediately began to expound his plans to a general sharing his quarters, until Konovn\u00edtsyn, who listened in weary silence, reminded him that they must go to see his Highness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nKut\u00fazov like all old people did not sleep much at night. He often fell asleep unexpectedly in the daytime, but at night, lying on his bed without undressing, he generally remained awake thinking.\n\nSo he lay now on his bed, supporting his large, heavy, scarred head on his plump hand, with his one eye open, meditating and peering into the darkness.\n\nSince Bennigsen, who corresponded with the Emperor and had more influence than anyone else on the staff, had begun to avoid him, Kut\u00fazov was more at ease as to the possibility of himself and his troops being obliged to take part in useless aggressive movements. The lesson of the Tar\u00fatino battle and of the day before it, which Kut\u00fazov remembered with pain, must, he thought, have some effect on others too.\n\n\u201cThey must understand that we can only lose by taking the offensive. Patience and time are my warriors, my champions,\u201d thought Kut\u00fazov. He knew that an apple should not be plucked while it is green. It will fall of itself when ripe, but if picked unripe the apple is spoiled, the tree is harmed, and your teeth are set on edge. Like an experienced sportsman he knew that the beast was wounded, and wounded as only the whole strength of Russia could have wounded it, but whether it was mortally wounded or not was still an undecided question. Now by the fact of Lauriston and Barth\u00e9lemi having been sent, and by the reports of the guerrillas, Kut\u00fazov was almost sure that the wound was mortal. But he needed further proofs and it was necessary to wait.\n\n\u201cThey want to run to see how they have wounded it. Wait and we shall see! Continual maneuvers, continual advances!\u201d thought he. \u201cWhat for? Only to distinguish themselves! As if fighting were fun. They are like children from whom one can\u2019t get any sensible account of what has happened because they all want to show how well they can fight. But that\u2019s not what is needed now.\n\n\u201cAnd what ingenious maneuvers they all propose to me! It seems to them that when they have thought of two or three contingencies\u201d (he remembered the general plan sent him from Petersburg) \u201cthey have foreseen everything. But the contingencies are endless.\u201d\n\nThe undecided question as to whether the wound inflicted at Borodin\u00f3 was mortal or not had hung over Kut\u00fazov\u2019s head for a whole month. On the one hand the French had occupied Moscow. On the other Kut\u00fazov felt assured with all his being that the terrible blow into which he and all the Russians had put their whole strength must have been mortal. But in any case proofs were needed; he had waited a whole month for them and grew more impatient the longer he waited. Lying on his bed during those sleepless nights he did just what he reproached those younger generals for doing. He imagined all sorts of possible contingencies, just like the younger men, but with this difference, that he saw thousands of contingencies instead of two or three and based nothing on them. The longer he thought the more contingencies presented themselves. He imagined all sorts of movements of the Napoleonic army as a whole or in sections\u2014against Petersburg, or against him, or to outflank him. He thought too of the possibility (which he feared most of all) that Napoleon might fight him with his own weapon and remain in Moscow awaiting him. Kut\u00fazov even imagined that Napoleon\u2019s army might turn back through Med\u00fdn and Yukhn\u00f3v, but the one thing he could not foresee was what happened\u2014the insane, convulsive stampede of Napoleon\u2019s army during its first eleven days after leaving Moscow: a stampede which made possible what Kut\u00fazov had not yet even dared to think of\u2014the complete extermination of the French. D\u00f3rokhov\u2019s report about Broussier\u2019s division, the guerrillas\u2019 reports of distress in Napoleon\u2019s army, rumors of preparations for leaving Moscow, all confirmed the supposition that the French army was beaten and preparing for flight. But these were only suppositions, which seemed important to the younger men but not to Kut\u00fazov. With his sixty years\u2019 experience he knew what value to attach to rumors, knew how apt people who desire anything are to group all news so that it appears to confirm what they desire, and he knew how readily in such cases they omit all that makes for the contrary. And the more he desired it the less he allowed himself to believe it. This question absorbed all his mental powers. All else was to him only life\u2019s customary routine. To such customary routine belonged his conversations with the staff, the letters he wrote from Tar\u00fatino to Madame de Sta\u00ebl, the reading of novels, the distribution of awards, his correspondence with Petersburg, and so on. But the destruction of the French, which he alone foresaw, was his heart\u2019s one desire.\n\nOn the night of the eleventh of October he lay leaning on his arm and thinking of that.\n\nThere was a stir in the next room and he heard the steps of Toll, Konovn\u00edtsyn, and Bolkhov\u00edtinov.\n\n\u201cEh, who\u2019s there? Come in, come in! What news?\u201d the field marshal called out to them.\n\nWhile a footman was lighting a candle, Toll communicated the substance of the news.\n\n\u201cWho brought it?\u201d asked Kut\u00fazov with a look which, when the candle was lit, struck Toll by its cold severity.\n\n\u201cThere can be no doubt about it, your Highness.\u201d\n\n\u201cCall him in, call him here.\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov sat up with one leg hanging down from the bed and his big paunch resting against the other which was doubled under him. He screwed up his seeing eye to scrutinize the messenger more carefully, as if wishing to read in his face what preoccupied his own mind.\n\n\u201cTell me, tell me, friend,\u201d said he to Bolkhov\u00edtinov in his low, aged voice, as he pulled together the shirt which gaped open on his chest, \u201ccome nearer\u2014nearer. What news have you brought me? Eh? That Napoleon has left Moscow? Are you sure? Eh?\u201d\n\nBolkhov\u00edtinov gave a detailed account from the beginning of all he had been told to report.\n\n\u201cSpeak quicker, quicker! Don\u2019t torture me!\u201d Kut\u00fazov interrupted him.\n\nBolkhov\u00edtinov told him everything and was then silent, awaiting instructions. Toll was beginning to say something but Kut\u00fazov checked him. He tried to say something, but his face suddenly puckered and wrinkled; he waved his arm at Toll and turned to the opposite side of the room, to the corner darkened by the icons that hung there.\n\n\u201cO Lord, my Creator, Thou has heard our prayer...\u201d said he in a tremulous voice with folded hands. \u201cRussia is saved. I thank Thee, O Lord!\u201d and he wept.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nFrom the time he received this news to the end of the campaign all Kut\u00fazov\u2019s activity was directed toward restraining his troops, by authority, by guile, and by entreaty, from useless attacks, maneuvers, or encounters with the perishing enemy. Dokht\u00farov went to M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets, but Kut\u00fazov lingered with the main army and gave orders for the evacuation of Kal\u00faga\u2014a retreat beyond which town seemed to him quite possible.\n\nEverywhere Kut\u00fazov retreated, but the enemy without waiting for his retreat fled in the opposite direction.\n\nNapoleon\u2019s historians describe to us his skilled maneuvers at Tar\u00fatino and M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets, and make conjectures as to what would have happened had Napoleon been in time to penetrate into the rich southern provinces.\n\nBut not to speak of the fact that nothing prevented him from advancing into those southern provinces (for the Russian army did not bar his way), the historians forget that nothing could have saved his army, for then already it bore within itself the germs of inevitable ruin. How could that army\u2014which had found abundant supplies in Moscow and had trampled them underfoot instead of keeping them, and on arriving at Smol\u00e9nsk had looted provisions instead of storing them\u2014how could that army recuperate in Kal\u00faga province, which was inhabited by Russians such as those who lived in Moscow, and where fire had the same property of consuming what was set ablaze?\n\nThat army could not recover anywhere. Since the battle of Borodin\u00f3 and the pillage of Moscow it had borne within itself, as it were, the chemical elements of dissolution.\n\nThe members of what had once been an army\u2014Napoleon himself and all his soldiers\u2014fled without knowing whither, each concerned only to make his escape as quickly as possible from this position, of the hopelessness of which they were all more or less vaguely conscious.\n\nSo it came about that at the council at M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets, when the generals pretending to confer together expressed various opinions, all mouths were closed by the opinion uttered by the simple-minded soldier Mouton who, speaking last, said what they all felt: that the one thing needful was to get away as quickly as possible; and no one, not even Napoleon, could say anything against that truth which they all recognized.\n\nBut though they all realized that it was necessary to get away, there still remained a feeling of shame at admitting that they must flee. An external shock was needed to overcome that shame, and this shock came in due time. It was what the French called \u201cle hourra de l\u2019Empereur.\u201d\n\nThe day after the council at M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets Napoleon rode out early in the morning amid the lines of his army with his suite of marshals and an escort, on the pretext of inspecting the army and the scene of the previous and of the impending battle. Some Cossacks on the prowl for booty fell in with the Emperor and very nearly captured him. If the Cossacks did not capture Napoleon then, what saved him was the very thing that was destroying the French army, the booty on which the Cossacks fell. Here as at Tar\u00fatino they went after plunder, leaving the men. Disregarding Napoleon they rushed after the plunder and Napoleon managed to escape.\n\nWhen les enfants du Don might so easily have taken the Emperor himself in the midst of his army, it was clear that there was nothing for it but to fly as fast as possible along the nearest, familiar road. Napoleon with his forty-year-old stomach understood that hint, not feeling his former agility and boldness, and under the influence of the fright the Cossacks had given him he at once agreed with Mouton and issued orders\u2014as the historians tell us\u2014to retreat by the Smol\u00e9nsk road.\n\nThat Napoleon agreed with Mouton, and that the army retreated, does not prove that Napoleon caused it to retreat, but that the forces which influenced the whole army and directed it along the Mozh\u00e1ysk (that is, the Smol\u00e9nsk) road acted simultaneously on him also.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nA man in motion always devises an aim for that motion. To be able to go a thousand miles he must imagine that something good awaits him at the end of those thousand miles. One must have the prospect of a promised land to have the strength to move.\n\nThe promised land for the French during their advance had been Moscow, during their retreat it was their native land. But that native land was too far off, and for a man going a thousand miles it is absolutely necessary to set aside his final goal and to say to himself: \u201cToday I shall get to a place twenty-five miles off where I shall rest and spend the night,\u201d and during the first day\u2019s journey that resting place eclipses his ultimate goal and attracts all his hopes and desires. And the impulses felt by a single person are always magnified in a crowd.\n\nFor the French retreating along the old Smol\u00e9nsk road, the final goal\u2014their native land\u2014was too remote, and their immediate goal was Smol\u00e9nsk, toward which all their desires and hopes, enormously intensified in the mass, urged them on. It was not that they knew that much food and fresh troops awaited them in Smol\u00e9nsk, nor that they were told so (on the contrary their superior officers, and Napoleon himself, knew that provisions were scarce there), but because this alone could give them strength to move on and endure their present privations. So both those who knew and those who did not know deceived themselves, and pushed on to Smol\u00e9nsk as to a promised land.\n\nComing out onto the highroad the French fled with surprising energy and unheard-of rapidity toward the goal they had fixed on. Besides the common impulse which bound the whole crowd of French into one mass and supplied them with a certain energy, there was another cause binding them together\u2014their great numbers. As with the physical law of gravity, their enormous mass drew the individual human atoms to itself. In their hundreds of thousands they moved like a whole nation.\n\nEach of them desired nothing more than to give himself up as a prisoner to escape from all this horror and misery; but on the one hand the force of this common attraction to Smol\u00e9nsk, their goal, drew each of them in the same direction; on the other hand an army corps could not surrender to a company, and though the French availed themselves of every convenient opportunity to detach themselves and to surrender on the slightest decent pretext, such pretexts did not always occur. Their very numbers and their crowded and swift movement deprived them of that possibility and rendered it not only difficult but impossible for the Russians to stop this movement, to which the French were directing all their energies. Beyond a certain limit no mechanical disruption of the body could hasten the process of decomposition.\n\nA lump of snow cannot be melted instantaneously. There is a certain limit of time in less than which no amount of heat can melt the snow. On the contrary the greater the heat the more solidified the remaining snow becomes.\n\nOf the Russian commanders Kut\u00fazov alone understood this. When the flight of the French army along the Smol\u00e9nsk road became well defined, what Konovn\u00edtsyn had foreseen on the night of the eleventh of October began to occur. The superior officers all wanted to distinguish themselves, to cut off, to seize, to capture, and to overthrow the French, and all clamored for action.\n\nKut\u00fazov alone used all his power (and such power is very limited in the case of any commander in chief) to prevent an attack.\n\nHe could not tell them what we say now: \u201cWhy fight, why block the road, losing our own men and inhumanly slaughtering unfortunate wretches? What is the use of that, when a third of their army has melted away on the road from Moscow to Vy\u00e1zma without any battle?\u201d But drawing from his aged wisdom what they could understand, he told them of the golden bridge, and they laughed at and slandered him, flinging themselves on, rending and exulting over the dying beast.\n\nErm\u00f3lov, Milor\u00e1dovich, Pl\u00e1tov, and others in proximity to the French near Vy\u00e1zma could not resist their desire to cut off and break up two French corps, and by way of reporting their intention to Kut\u00fazov they sent him a blank sheet of paper in an envelope.\n\nAnd try as Kut\u00fazov might to restrain the troops, our men attacked, trying to bar the road. Infantry regiments, we are told, advanced to the attack with music and with drums beating, and killed and lost thousands of men.\n\nBut they did not cut off or overthrow anybody and the French army, closing up more firmly at the danger, continued, while steadily melting away, to pursue its fatal path to Smol\u00e9nsk.\n\n\n\nBOOK FOURTEEN: 1812\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nThe Battle of Borodin\u00f3, with the occupation of Moscow that followed it and the flight of the French without further conflicts, is one of the most instructive phenomena in history.\n\nAll historians agree that the external activity of states and nations in their conflicts with one anothe", "sequence": 26}, {"offset": 2700000, "text": "r is expressed in wars, and that as a direct result of greater or less success in war the political strength of states and nations increases or decreases.\n\nStrange as may be the historical account of how some king or emperor, having quarreled with another, collects an army, fights his enemy\u2019s army, gains a victory by killing three, five, or ten thousand men, and subjugates a kingdom and an entire nation of several millions, all the facts of history (as far as we know it) confirm the truth of the statement that the greater or lesser success of one army against another is the cause, or at least an essential indication, of an increase or decrease in the strength of the nation\u2014even though it is unintelligible why the defeat of an army\u2014a hundredth part of a nation\u2014should oblige that whole nation to submit. An army gains a victory, and at once the rights of the conquering nation have increased to the detriment of the defeated. An army has suffered defeat, and at once a people loses its rights in proportion to the severity of the reverse, and if its army suffers a complete defeat the nation is quite subjugated.\n\nSo according to history it has been found from the most ancient times, and so it is to our own day. All Napoleon\u2019s wars serve to confirm this rule. In proportion to the defeat of the Austrian army Austria loses its rights, and the rights and the strength of France increase. The victories of the French at Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt destroy the independent existence of Prussia.\n\nBut then, in 1812, the French gain a victory near Moscow. Moscow is taken and after that, with no further battles, it is not Russia that ceases to exist, but the French army of six hundred thousand, and then Napoleonic France itself. To strain the facts to fit the rules of history: to say that the field of battle at Borodin\u00f3 remained in the hands of the Russians, or that after Moscow there were other battles that destroyed Napoleon\u2019s army, is impossible.\n\nAfter the French victory at Borodin\u00f3 there was no general engagement nor any that were at all serious, yet the French army ceased to exist. What does this mean? If it were an example taken from the history of China, we might say that it was not an historic phenomenon (which is the historians\u2019 usual expedient when anything does not fit their standards); if the matter concerned some brief conflict in which only a small number of troops took part, we might treat it as an exception; but this event occurred before our fathers\u2019 eyes, and for them it was a question of the life or death of their fatherland, and it happened in the greatest of all known wars.\n\nThe period of the campaign of 1812 from the battle of Borodin\u00f3 to the expulsion of the French proved that the winning of a battle does not produce a conquest and is not even an invariable indication of conquest; it proved that the force which decides the fate of peoples lies not in the conquerors, nor even in armies and battles, but in something else.\n\nThe French historians, describing the condition of the French army before it left Moscow, affirm that all was in order in the Grand Army, except the cavalry, the artillery, and the transport\u2014there was no forage for the horses or the cattle. That was a misfortune no one could remedy, for the peasants of the district burned their hay rather than let the French have it.\n\nThe victory gained did not bring the usual results because the peasants Karp and Vlas (who after the French had evacuated Moscow drove in their carts to pillage the town, and in general personally failed to manifest any heroic feelings), and the whole innumerable multitude of such peasants, did not bring their hay to Moscow for the high price offered them, but burned it instead.\n\nLet us imagine two men who have come out to fight a duel with rapiers according to all the rules of the art of fencing. The fencing has gone on for some time; suddenly one of the combatants, feeling himself wounded and understanding that the matter is no joke but concerns his life, throws down his rapier, and seizing the first cudgel that comes to hand begins to brandish it. Then let us imagine that the combatant who so sensibly employed the best and simplest means to attain his end was at the same time influenced by traditions of chivalry and, desiring to conceal the facts of the case, insisted that he had gained his victory with the rapier according to all the rules of art. One can imagine what confusion and obscurity would result from such an account of the duel.\n\nThe fencer who demanded a contest according to the rules of fencing was the French army; his opponent who threw away the rapier and snatched up the cudgel was the Russian people; those who try to explain the matter according to the rules of fencing are the historians who have described the event.\n\nAfter the burning of Smol\u00e9nsk a war began which did not follow any previous traditions of war. The burning of towns and villages, the retreats after battles, the blow dealt at Borodin\u00f3 and the renewed retreat, the burning of Moscow, the capture of marauders, the seizure of transports, and the guerrilla war were all departures from the rules.\n\nNapoleon felt this, and from the time he took up the correct fencing attitude in Moscow and instead of his opponent\u2019s rapier saw a cudgel raised above his head, he did not cease to complain to Kut\u00fazov and to the Emperor Alexander that the war was being carried on contrary to all the rules\u2014as if there were any rules for killing people. In spite of the complaints of the French as to the nonobservance of the rules, in spite of the fact that to some highly placed Russians it seemed rather disgraceful to fight with a cudgel and they wanted to assume a pose en quarte or en tierce according to all the rules, and to make an adroit thrust en prime, and so on\u2014the cudgel of the people\u2019s war was lifted with all its menacing and majestic strength, and without consulting anyone\u2019s tastes or rules and regardless of anything else, it rose and fell with stupid simplicity, but consistently, and belabored the French till the whole invasion had perished.\n\nAnd it is well for a people who do not\u2014as the French did in 1813\u2014salute according to all the rules of art, and, presenting the hilt of their rapier gracefully and politely, hand it to their magnanimous conqueror, but at the moment of trial, without asking what rules others have adopted in similar cases, simply and easily pick up the first cudgel that comes to hand and strike with it till the feeling of resentment and revenge in their soul yields to a feeling of contempt and compassion.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nOne of the most obvious and advantageous departures from the so-called laws of war is the action of scattered groups against men pressed together in a mass. Such action always occurs in wars that take on a national character. In such actions, instead of two crowds opposing each other, the men disperse, attack singly, run away when attacked by stronger forces, but again attack when opportunity offers. This was done by the guerrillas in Spain, by the mountain tribes in the Caucasus, and by the Russians in 1812.\n\nPeople have called this kind of war \u201cguerrilla warfare\u201d and assume that by so calling it they have explained its meaning. But such a war does not fit in under any rule and is directly opposed to a well-known rule of tactics which is accepted as infallible. That rule says that an attacker should concentrate his forces in order to be stronger than his opponent at the moment of conflict.\n\nGuerrilla war (always successful, as history shows) directly infringes that rule.\n\nThis contradiction arises from the fact that military science assumes the strength of an army to be identical with its numbers. Military science says that the more troops the greater the strength. Les gros bataillons ont toujours raison.\n\nFor military science to say this is like defining momentum in mechanics by reference to the mass only: stating that momenta are equal or unequal to each other simply because the masses involved are equal or unequal.\n\nMomentum (quantity of motion) is the product of mass and velocity.\n\nIn military affairs the strength of an army is the product of its mass and some unknown x.\n\nMilitary science, seeing in history innumerable instances of the fact that the size of any army does not coincide with its strength and that small detachments defeat larger ones, obscurely admits the existence of this unknown factor and tries to discover it\u2014now in a geometric formation, now in the equipment employed, now, and most usually, in the genius of the commanders. But the assignment of these various meanings to the factor does not yield results which accord with the historic facts.\n\nYet it is only necessary to abandon the false view (adopted to gratify the \u201cheroes\u201d) of the efficacy of the directions issued in wartime by commanders, in order to find this unknown quantity.\n\nThat unknown quantity is the spirit of the army, that is to say, the greater or lesser readiness to fight and face danger felt by all the men composing an army, quite independently of whether they are, or are not, fighting under the command of a genius, in two\u2014or three-line formation, with cudgels or with rifles that repeat thirty times a minute. Men who want to fight will always put themselves in the most advantageous conditions for fighting.\n\nThe spirit of an army is the factor which multiplied by the mass gives the resulting force. To define and express the significance of this unknown factor\u2014the spirit of an army\u2014is a problem for science.\n\nThis problem is only solvable if we cease arbitrarily to substitute for the unknown x itself the conditions under which that force becomes apparent\u2014such as the commands of the general, the equipment employed, and so on\u2014mistaking these for the real significance of the factor, and if we recognize this unknown quantity in its entirety as being the greater or lesser desire to fight and to face danger. Only then, expressing known historic facts by equations and comparing the relative significance of this factor, can we hope to define the unknown.\n\nTen men, battalions, or divisions, fighting fifteen men, battalions, or divisions, conquer\u2014that is, kill or take captive\u2014all the others, while themselves losing four, so that on the one side four and on the other fifteen were lost. Consequently the four were equal to the fifteen, and therefore 4x = 15y. Consequently x/y = 15/4. This equation does not give us the value of the unknown factor but gives us a ratio between two unknowns. And by bringing variously selected historic units (battles, campaigns, periods of war) into such equations, a series of numbers could be obtained in which certain laws should exist and might be discovered.\n\nThe tactical rule that an army should act in masses when attacking, and in smaller groups in retreat, unconsciously confirms the truth that the strength of an army depends on its spirit. To lead men forward under fire more discipline (obtainable only by movement in masses) is needed than is needed to resist attacks. But this rule which leaves out of account the spirit of the army continually proves incorrect and is in particularly striking contrast to the facts when some strong rise or fall in the spirit of the troops occurs, as in all national wars.\n\nThe French, retreating in 1812\u2014though according to tactics they should have separated into detachments to defend themselves\u2014congregated into a mass because the spirit of the army had so fallen that only the mass held the army together. The Russians, on the contrary, ought according to tactics to have attacked in mass, but in fact they split up into small units, because their spirit had so risen that separate individuals, without orders, dealt blows at the French without needing any compulsion to induce them to expose themselves to hardships and dangers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe so-called partisan war began with the entry of the French into Smol\u00e9nsk.\n\nBefore partisan warfare had been officially recognized by the government, thousands of enemy stragglers, marauders, and foragers had been destroyed by the Cossacks and the peasants, who killed them off as instinctively as dogs worry a stray mad dog to death. Den\u00eds Dav\u00fddov, with his Russian instinct, was the first to recognize the value of this terrible cudgel which regardless of the rules of military science destroyed the French, and to him belongs the credit for taking the first step toward regularizing this method of warfare.\n\nOn August 24 Dav\u00fddov\u2019s first partisan detachment was formed and then others were recognized. The further the campaign progressed the more numerous these detachments became.\n\nThe irregulars destroyed the great army piecemeal. They gathered the fallen leaves that dropped of themselves from that withered tree\u2014the French army\u2014and sometimes shook that tree itself. By October, when the French were fleeing toward Smol\u00e9nsk, there were hundreds of such companies, of various sizes and characters. There were some that adopted all the army methods and had infantry, artillery, staffs, and the comforts of life. Others consisted solely of Cossack cavalry. There were also small scratch groups of foot and horse, and groups of peasants and landowners that remained unknown. A sacristan commanded one party which captured several hundred prisoners in the course of a month; and there was Vas\u00edlisa, the wife of a village elder, who slew hundreds of the French.\n\nThe partisan warfare flamed up most fiercely in the latter days of October. Its first period had passed: when the partisans themselves, amazed at their own boldness, feared every minute to be surrounded and captured by the French, and hid in the forests without unsaddling, hardly daring to dismount and always expecting to be pursued. By the end of October this kind of warfare had taken definite shape: it had become clear to all what could be ventured against the French and what could not. Now only the commanders of detachments with staffs, and moving according to rules at a distance from the French, still regarded many things as impossible. The small bands that had started their activities long before and had already observed the French closely considered things possible which the commanders of the big detachments did not dare to contemplate. The Cossacks and peasants who crept in among the French now considered everything possible.\n\nOn October 22, Den\u00edsov (who was one of the irregulars) was with his group at the height of the guerrilla enthusiasm. Since early morning he and his party had been on the move. All day long he had been watching from the forest that skirted the highroad a large French convoy of cavalry baggage and Russian prisoners separated from the rest of the army, which\u2014as was learned from spies and prisoners\u2014was moving under a strong escort to Smol\u00e9nsk. Besides Den\u00edsov and D\u00f3lokhov (who also led a small party and moved in Den\u00edsov\u2019s vicinity), the commanders of some large divisions with staffs also knew of this convoy and, as Den\u00edsov expressed it, were sharpening their teeth for it. Two of the commanders of large parties\u2014one a Pole and the other a German\u2014sent invitations to Den\u00edsov almost simultaneously, requesting him to join up with their divisions to attack the convoy.\n\n\u201cNo, bwother, I have gwown mustaches myself,\u201d said Den\u00edsov on reading these documents, and he wrote to the German that, despite his heartfelt desire to serve under so valiant and renowned a general, he had to forgo that pleasure because he was already under the command of the Polish general. To the Polish general he replied to the same effect, informing him that he was already under the command of the German.\n\nHaving arranged matters thus, Den\u00edsov and D\u00f3lokhov intended, without reporting matters to the higher command, to attack and seize that convoy with their own small forces. On October 22 it was moving from the village of Mik\u00falino to that of Sh\u00e1mshevo. To the left of the road between Mik\u00falino and Sh\u00e1mshevo there were large forests, extending in some places up to the road itself though in others a mile or more back from it. Through these forests Den\u00edsov and his party rode all day, sometimes keeping well back in them and sometimes coming to the very edge, but never losing sight of the moving French. That morning, Cossacks of Den\u00edsov\u2019s party had seized and carried off into the forest two wagons loaded with cavalry saddles, which had stuck in the mud not far from Mik\u00falino where the forest ran close to the road. Since then, and until evening, the party had watched the movements of the French without attacking. It was necessary to let the French reach Sh\u00e1mshevo quietly without alarming them and then, after joining D\u00f3lokhov who was to come that evening to a consultation at a watchman\u2019s hut in the forest less than a mile from Sh\u00e1mshevo, to surprise the French at dawn, falling like an avalanche on their heads from two sides, and rout and capture them all at one blow.\n\nIn their rear, more than a mile from Mik\u00falino where the forest came right up to the road, six Cossacks were posted to report if any fresh columns of French should show themselves.\n\nBeyond Sh\u00e1mshevo, D\u00f3lokhov was to observe the road in the same way, to find out at what distance there were other French troops. They reckoned that the convoy had fifteen hundred men. Den\u00edsov had two hundred, and D\u00f3lokhov might have as many more, but the disparity of numbers did not deter Den\u00edsov. All that he now wanted to know was what troops these were and to learn that he had to capture a \u201ctongue\u201d\u2014that is, a man from the enemy column. That morning\u2019s attack on the wagons had been made so hastily that the Frenchmen with the wagons had all been killed; only a little drummer boy had been taken alive, and as he was a straggler he could tell them nothing definite about the troops in that column.\n\nDen\u00edsov considered it dangerous to make a second attack for fear of putting the whole column on the alert, so he sent T\u00edkhon Shcherb\u00e1ty, a peasant of his party, to Sh\u00e1mshevo to try and seize at least one of the French quartermasters who had been sent on in advance.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nIt was a warm rainy autumn day. The sky and the horizon were both the color of muddy water. At times a sort of mist descended, and then suddenly heavy slanting rain came down.\n\nDen\u00edsov in a felt cloak and a sheepskin cap from which the rain ran down was riding a thin thoroughbred horse with sunken sides. Like his horse, which turned its head and laid its ears back, he shrank from the driving rain and gazed anxiously before him. His thin face with its short, thick black beard looked angry.\n\nBeside Den\u00edsov rode an esaul, Den\u00edsov\u2019s fellow worker, also in felt cloak and sheepskin cap, and riding a large sleek Don horse.\n\nEsaul Lov\u00e1yski the Third was a tall man as straight as an arrow, pale-faced, fair-haired, with narrow light eyes and with calm self-satisfaction in his face and bearing. Though it was impossible to say in what the peculiarity of the horse and rider lay, yet at first glance at the esaul and Den\u00edsov one saw that the latter was wet and uncomfortable and was a man mounted on a horse, while looking at the esaul one saw that he was as comfortable and as much at ease as always and that he was not a man who had mounted a horse, but a man who was one with his horse, a being consequently possessed of twofold strength.\n\nA little ahead of them walked a peasant guide, wet to the skin and wearing a gray peasant coat and a white knitted cap.\n\nA little behind, on a poor, small, lean Kirgh\u00edz mount with an enormous tail and mane and a bleeding mouth, rode a young officer in a blue French overcoat.\n\nBeside him rode an hussar, with a boy in a tattered French uniform and blue cap behind him on the crupper of his horse. The boy held on to the hussar with cold, red hands, and raising his eyebrows gazed about him with surprise. This was the French drummer boy captured that morning.\n\nBehind them along the narrow, sodden, cut up forest road came hussars in threes and fours, and then Cossacks: some in felt cloaks, some in French greatcoats, and some with horsecloths over their heads. The horses, being drenched by the rain, all looked black whether chestnut or bay. Their necks, with their wet, close-clinging manes, looked strangely thin. Steam rose from them. Clothes, saddles, reins, were all wet, slippery, and sodden, like the ground and the fallen leaves that strewed the road. The men sat huddled up trying not to stir, so as to warm the water that had trickled to their bodies and not admit the fresh cold water that was leaking in under their seats, their knees, and at the back of their necks. In the midst of the outspread line of Cossacks two wagons, drawn by French horses and by saddled Cossack horses that had been hitched on in front, rumbled over the tree stumps and branches and splashed through the water that lay in the ruts.\n\nDen\u00edsov\u2019s horse swerved aside to avoid a pool in the track and bumped his rider\u2019s knee against a tree.\n\n\u201cOh, the devil!\u201d exclaimed Den\u00edsov angrily, and showing his teeth he struck his horse three times with his whip, splashing himself and his comrades with mud.\n\nDen\u00edsov was out of sorts both because of the rain and also from hunger (none of them had eaten anything since morning), and yet more because he still had no news from D\u00f3lokhov and the man sent to capture a \u201ctongue\u201d had not returned.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll hardly be another such chance to fall on a transport as today. It\u2019s too risky to attack them by oneself, and if we put it off till another day one of the big guerrilla detachments will snatch the prey from under our noses,\u201d thought Den\u00edsov, continually peering forward, hoping to see a messenger from D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nOn coming to a path in the forest along which he could see far to the right, Den\u00edsov stopped.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone coming,\u201d said he.\n\nThe esaul looked in the direction Den\u00edsov indicated.\n\n\u201cThere are two, an officer and a Cossack. But it is not presupposable that it is the lieutenant colonel himself,\u201d said the esaul, who was fond of using words the Cossacks did not know.\n\nThe approaching riders having descended a decline were no longer visible, but they reappeared a few minutes later. In front, at a weary gallop and using his leather whip, rode an officer, disheveled and drenched, whose trousers had worked up to above his knees. Behind him, standing in the stirrups, trotted a Cossack. The officer, a very young lad with a broad rosy face and keen merry eyes, galloped up to Den\u00edsov and handed him a sodden envelope.\n\n\u201cFrom the general,\u201d said the officer. \u201cPlease excuse its not being quite dry.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov, frowning, took the envelope and opened it.\n\n\u201cThere, they kept telling us: \u2018It\u2019s dangerous, it\u2019s dangerous,\u2019\u201d said the officer, addressing the esaul while Den\u00edsov was reading the dispatch. \u201cBut Komar\u00f3v and I\u201d\u2014he pointed to the Cossack\u2014\u201cwere prepared. We have each of us two pistols.... But what\u2019s this?\u201d he asked, noticing the French drummer boy. \u201cA prisoner? You\u2019ve already been in action? May I speak to him?\u201d\n\n\u201cWost\u00f3v! P\u00e9tya!\u201d exclaimed Den\u00edsov, having run through the dispatch. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you say who you were?\u201d and turning with a smile he held out his hand to the lad.\n\nThe officer was P\u00e9tya Rost\u00f3v.\n\nAll the way P\u00e9tya had been preparing himself to behave with Den\u00edsov as befitted a grown-up man and an officer\u2014without hinting at their previous acquaintance. But as soon as Den\u00edsov smiled at him P\u00e9tya brightened up, blushed with pleasure, forgot the official manner he had been rehearsing, and began telling him how he had already been in a battle near Vy\u00e1zma and how a certain hussar had distinguished himself there.\n\n\u201cWell, I am glad to see you,\u201d Den\u00edsov interrupted him, and his face again assumed its anxious expression.\n\n\u201cMichael Feokl\u00edtych,\u201d said he to the esaul, \u201cthis is again fwom that German, you know. He\u201d\u2014he indicated P\u00e9tya\u2014\u201cis serving under him.\u201d\n\nAnd Den\u00edsov told the esaul that the dispatch just delivered was a repetition of the German general\u2019s demand that he should join forces with him for an attack on the transport.\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t take it tomowwow, he\u2019ll snatch it fwom under our noses,\u201d he added.\n\nWhile Den\u00edsov was talking to the esaul, P\u00e9tya\u2014abashed by Den\u00edsov\u2019s cold tone and supposing that it was due to the condition of his trousers\u2014furtively tried to pull them down under his greatcoat so that no one should notice it, while maintaining as martial an air as possible.\n\n\u201cWill there be any orders, your honor?\u201d he asked Den\u00edsov, holding his hand at the salute and resuming the game of adjutant and general for which he had prepared himself, \u201cor shall I remain with your honor?\u201d\n\n\u201cOrders?\u201d Den\u00edsov repeated thoughtfully. \u201cBut can you stay till tomowwow?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, please... May I stay with you?\u201d cried P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cBut, just what did the genewal tell you? To weturn at once?\u201d asked Den\u00edsov.\n\nP\u00e9tya blushed.\n\n\u201cHe gave me no instructions. I think I could?\u201d he returned, inquiringly.\n\n\u201cWell, all wight,\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\nAnd turning to his men he directed a party to go on to the halting place arranged near the watchman\u2019s hut in the forest, and told the officer on the Kirgh\u00edz horse (who performed the duties of an adjutant) to go and find out where D\u00f3lokhov was and whether he would come that evening. Den\u00edsov himself intended going with the esaul and P\u00e9tya to the edge of the forest where it reached out to Sh\u00e1mshevo, to have a look at the part of the French bivouac they were to attack next day.\n\n\u201cWell, old fellow,\u201d said he to the peasant guide, \u201clead us to Sh\u00e1mshevo.\u201d\n\nDen\u00edsov, P\u00e9tya, and the esaul, accompanied by some Cossacks and the hussar who had the prisoner, rode to the left across a ravine to the edge of the forest.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe rain had stopped, and only the mist was falling and drops from the trees. Den\u00edsov, the esaul, and P\u00e9tya rode silently, following the peasant in the knitted cap who, stepping lightly with outturned toes and moving noiselessly in his bast shoes over the roots and wet leaves, silently led them to the edge of the forest.\n\nHe ascended an incline, stopped, looked about him, and advanced to where the screen of trees was less dense. On reaching a large oak tree that had not yet shed its leaves, he stopped and beckoned mysteriously to them with his hand.\n\nDen\u00edsov and P\u00e9tya rode up to him. From the spot where the peasant was standing they could see the French. Immediately beyond the forest, on a downward slope, lay a field of spring rye. To the right, beyond a steep ravine, was a small village and a landowner\u2019s house with a broken roof. In the village, in the house, in the garden, by the well, by the pond, over all the rising ground, and all along the road uphill from the bridge leading to the village, not more than five hundred yards away, crowds of men could be seen through the shimmering mist. Their un-Russian shouting at their horses which were straining uphill with the carts, and their calls to one another, could be clearly heard.\n\n\u201cBwing the prisoner here,\u201d said Den\u00edsov in a low voice, not taking his eyes off the French.\n\nA Cossack dismounted, lifted the boy down, and took him to Den\u00edsov. Pointing to the French troops, Den\u00edsov asked him what these and those of them were. The boy, thrusting his cold hands into his pockets and lifting his eyebrows, looked at Den\u00edsov in affright, but in spite of an evident desire to say all he knew gave confused answers, merely assenting to everything Den\u00edsov asked him. Den\u00edsov turned away from him frowning and addressed the esaul, conveying his own conjectures to him.\n\nP\u00e9tya, rapidly turning his head, looked now at the drummer boy, now at Den\u00edsov, now at the esaul, and now at the French in the village and along the road, trying not to miss anything of importance.\n\n\u201cWhether D\u00f3lokhov comes or not, we must seize it, eh?\u201d said Den\u00edsov with a merry sparkle in his eyes.\n\n\u201cIt is a very suitable spot,\u201d said the esaul.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll send the infantwy down by the swamps,\u201d Den\u00edsov continued. \u201cThey\u2019ll cweep up to the garden; you\u2019ll wide up fwom there with the Cossacks\u201d\u2014he pointed to a spot in the forest beyond the village\u2014\u201cand I with my hussars fwom here. And at the signal shot...\u201d\n\n\u201cThe hollow is impassable\u2014there\u2019s a swamp there,\u201d said the esaul. \u201cThe horses would sink. We must ride round more to the left....\u201d\n\nWhile they were talking in undertones the crack of a shot sounded from the low ground by the pond, a puff of white smoke appeared, then another, and the sound of hundreds of seemingly merry French voices shouting together came up from the slope. For a moment Den\u00edsov and the esaul drew back. They were so near that they thought they were the cause of the firing and shouting. But the firing and shouting did not relate to them. Down below, a man wearing something red was running through the marsh. The French were evidently firing and shouting at him.\n\n\u201cWhy, that\u2019s our T\u00edkhon,\u201d said the esaul.\n\n\u201cSo it is! It is!\u201d\n\n\u201cThe wascal!\u201d said Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll get away!\u201d said the esaul, screwing up his eyes.\n\nThe man whom they called T\u00edkhon, having run to the stream, plunged in so that the water splashed in the air, and, having disappeared for an instant, scrambled out on all fours, all black with the wet, and ran on. The French who had been pursuing him stopped.\n\n\u201cSmart, that!\u201d said the esaul.\n\n\u201cWhat a beast!\u201d said Den\u00edsov with his former look of vexation. \u201cWhat has he been doing all this time?\u201d\n\n\u201cWho is he?\u201d asked P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our plast\u00fan. I sent him to capture a \u2018tongue.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, yes,\u201d said P\u00e9tya, nodding at the first words Den\u00edsov uttered as if he understood it all, though he really did not understand anything of it.\n\nT\u00edkhon Shcherb\u00e1ty was one of the most indispensable men in their band. He was a peasant from Pokr\u00f3vsk, near the river Gzhat. When Den\u00edsov had come to Pokr\u00f3vsk at the beginning of his operations and had as usual summoned the village elder and asked him what he knew about the French, the elder, as though shielding himself, had replied, as all village elders did, that he had neither seen nor heard anything of them. But when Den\u00edsov explained that his purpose was to kill the French, and asked if no French had strayed that way, the elder replied that some \u201cmore-orderers\u201d had really been at their village, but that T\u00edkhon Shcherb\u00e1ty was the only man who dealt with such matters. Den\u00edsov had T\u00edkhon called and, having praised him for his activity, said a few words in the elder\u2019s presence about loyalty to the Tsar and the country and the hatred of the French that all sons of the fatherland should cherish.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t do the French any harm,\u201d said T\u00edkhon, evidently frightened by Den\u00edsov\u2019s words. \u201cWe only fooled about with the lads for fun, you know! We killed a score or so of \u2018more-orderers,\u2019 but we did no harm else....\u201d\n\nNext day when Den\u00edsov had left Pokr\u00f3vsk, having quite forgotten about this peasant, it was reported to him that T\u00edkhon had attached himself to their party and asked to be allowed to remain with it. Den\u00edsov gave orders to let him do so.\n\nT\u00edkhon, who at first did rough work, laying campfires, fetching water, flaying dead horses, and so on, soon showed a great liking and aptitude for partisan warfare. At night he would go out for booty and always brought back French clothing and weapons, and when told to would bring in French captives also. Den\u00edsov then relieved him from drudgery and began taking him with him when he went out on expeditions and had him enrolled among the Cossacks.\n\nT\u00edkhon did not like riding, and always went on foot, never lagging behind the cavalry. He was armed with a musketoon (which he carried rather as a joke), a pike and an ax, which latter he used as a wolf uses its teeth, with equal ease picking fleas out of its fur or crunching thick bones. T\u00edkhon with equal accuracy would split logs with blows at arm\u2019s length, or holding the head of the ax would cut thin little pegs or carve spoons. In Den\u00edsov\u2019s party he held a peculiar and exceptional position. When anything particularly difficult or nasty had to be done\u2014to push a cart out of the mud with one\u2019s shoulders, pull a horse out of a swamp by its tail, skin it, slink in among the French, or walk more than thirty miles in a day\u2014everybody pointed laughingly at T\u00edkhon.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t hurt that devil\u2014he\u2019s as strong as a horse!\u201d they said of him.\n\nOnce a Frenchman T\u00edkhon was trying to capture fired a pistol at him and shot him in the fleshy part of the back. That wound (which T\u00edkhon treated only with internal and external applications of vodka) was the subject of the liveliest jokes by the whole detachment\u2014jokes in which T\u00edkhon readily joined.\n\n\u201cHallo, mate! Never again? Gave you a twist?\u201d the Cossacks would banter him. And T\u00edkhon, purposely writhing and making faces, pretended to be angry and swore at the French with the funniest curses. The only effect of this incident on T\u00edkhon was that after being wounded he seldom brought in prisoners.\n\nHe was the bravest and most useful man in the party. No one found more opportunities for attacking, no one captured or killed more Frenchmen, and consequently he was made the buffoon of all the Cossacks and hussars and willingly accepted that role. Now he had been sent by Den\u00edsov overnight to Sh\u00e1mshevo to capture a \u201ctongue.\u201d But whether because he had not been content to take only one Frenchman or because he had slept through the night, he had crept by day into some bushes right among the French and, as Den\u00edsov had witnessed from above, had been detected by them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAfter talking for some time with the esaul about next day\u2019s attack, which now, seeing how near they were to the French, he seemed to have definitely decided on, Den\u00edsov turned his horse and rode back.\n\n\u201cNow, my lad, we\u2019ll go and get dwy,\u201d he said to P\u00e9tya.\n\nAs they approached the watchhouse Den\u00edsov stopped, peering into the forest. Among the trees a man with long legs and long, swinging arms, wearing a short jacket, bast shoes, and a Kaz\u00e1n hat, was approaching with long, light steps. He had a musketoon over his shoulder and an ax stuck in his girdle. When he espied Den\u00edsov he hastily threw something into the bushes, removed his sodden hat by its floppy brim, and approached his commander. It was T\u00edkhon. His wrinkled and pockmarked face and narrow little eyes beamed with self-satisfied merriment. He lifted his head high and gazed at Den\u00edsov as if repressing a laugh.\n\n\u201cWell, where did you disappear to?\u201d inquired Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cWhere did I disappear to? I went to get Frenchmen,\u201d answered T\u00edkhon boldly and hurriedly, in a husky but melodious bass voice.\n\n\u201cWhy did you push yourself in there by daylight? You ass! Well, why haven\u2019t you taken one?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I took one all right,\u201d said T\u00edkhon.\n\n\u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, I took him first thing at dawn,\u201d T\u00edkhon continued, spreading out his flat feet with outturned toes in their bast shoes. \u201cI took him into the forest. Then I see he\u2019s no good and think I\u2019ll go and fetch a likelier one.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see?... What a wogue\u2014it\u2019s just as I thought,\u201d said Den\u00edsov to the esaul. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bwing that one?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was the good of bringing him?\u201d T\u00edkhon interrupted hastily and angrily\u2014\u201cthat one wouldn\u2019t have done for you. As if I don\u2019t know what sort you want!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a bwute you are!... Well?\u201d\n\n\u201cI went for another one,\u201d T\u00edkhon continued, \u201cand I crept like this through the wood and lay down.\u201d (He suddenly lay down on his stomach with a supple movement to show how he had done it.) \u201cOne turned up and I grabbed him, like this.\u201d (He jumped up quickly and lightly.) \u201c\u2018Come along to the colonel,\u2019 I said. He starts yelling, and suddenly there were four of them. They rushed at me with their little swords. So I went for them with my ax, this way: \u2018What are you up to?\u2019 says I. \u2018Christ be with you!\u2019\u201d shouted T\u00edkhon, waving his arms with an angry scowl and throwing out his chest.\n\n\u201cYes, we saw from the hill how you took to your heels through the puddles!\u201d said the esaul, screwing up his glittering eyes.\n\nP\u00e9tya badly wanted to laugh, but noticed that they all refrained from laughing. He turned his eyes rapidly from T\u00edkhon\u2019s face to the esaul\u2019s and Den\u00edsov\u2019s, unable to make out what it all meant.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t play the fool!\u201d said Den\u00edsov, coughing angrily. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you bwing the first one?\u201d\n\nT\u00edkhon scratched his back with one hand and his head with the other, then suddenly his whole face expanded into a beaming, foolish grin, disclosing a gap where he had lost a tooth (that was why he was called Shcherb\u00e1ty\u2014the gap-toothed). Den\u00edsov smiled, and P\u00e9tya burst into a peal of merry laughter in which T\u00edkhon himself joined.\n\n\u201cOh, but he was a regular good-for-nothing,\u201d said T\u00edkhon. \u201cThe clothes on him\u2014poor stuff! How could I bring him? And so rude, your honor! Why, he says: \u2018I\u2019m a general\u2019s son myself, I won\u2019t go!\u2019 he says.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are a bwute!\u201d said Den\u00edsov. \u201cI wanted to question...\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I questioned him,\u201d said T\u00edkhon. \u201cHe said he didn\u2019t know much. \u2018There are a lot of us,\u2019 he says, \u2018but all poor stuff\u2014only soldiers in name,\u2019 he says. \u2018Shout loud at them,\u2019 he says, \u2018and you\u2019ll take them all,\u2019\u201d T\u00edkhon concluded, looking cheerfully and resolutely into Den\u00edsov\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll give you a hundwed sharp lashes\u2014that\u2019ll teach you to play the fool!\u201d said Den\u00edsov severely.\n\n\u201cBut why are you angry?\u201d remonstrated T\u00edkhon, \u201cjust as if I\u2019d never seen your Frenchmen! Only wait till it gets dark and I\u2019ll fetch you any of them you want\u2014three if you like.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, let\u2019s go,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, and rode all the way to the watchhouse in silence and frowning angrily.\n\nT\u00edkhon followed behind and P\u00e9tya heard the Cossacks laughing with him and at him, about some pair of boots he had thrown into the bushes.\n\nWhen the fit of laughter that had seized him at T\u00edkhon\u2019s words and smile had passed and P\u00e9tya realized for a moment that this T\u00edkhon had killed a man, he felt uneasy. He looked round at the captive drummer boy and felt a pang in his heart. But this uneasiness lasted only a moment. He felt it necessary to hold his head higher, to brace himself, and to question the esaul with an air of importance about tomorrow\u2019s undertaking, that he might not be unworthy of the company in which he found himself.\n\nThe officer who had been sent to inquire met Den\u00edsov on the way with the news that D\u00f3lokhov was soon coming and that all was well with him.\n\nDen\u00edsov at once cheered up and, calling P\u00e9tya to him, said: \u201cWell, tell me about yourself.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nP\u00e9tya, having left his people after their departure from Moscow, joined his regiment and was soon taken as orderly by a general commanding a large guerrilla detachment. From the time he received his commission, and especially since he had joined the active army and taken part in the battle of Vy\u00e1zma, P\u00e9tya had been in a constant state of blissful excitement at being grown-up and in a perpetual ecstatic hurry not to miss any chance to do something really heroic. He was highly delighted with what he saw and experienced in the army, but at the same time it always seemed to him that the really heroic exploits were being performed just where he did not happen to be. And he was always in a hurry to get where he was not.\n\nWhen on the twenty-first of October his general expressed a wish to send somebody to Den\u00edsov\u2019s detachment, P\u00e9tya begged so piteously to be sent that the general could not refuse. But when dispatching him he recalled P\u00e9tya\u2019s mad action at the battle of Vy\u00e1zma, where instead of riding by the road to the place to which he had been sent, he had galloped to the advanced line under the fire of the French and had there twice fired his pistol. So now the general explicitly forbade his taking part in any action whatever of Den\u00edsov\u2019s. That was why P\u00e9tya had blushed and grown confused when Den\u00edsov asked him whether he could stay. Before they had ridden to the outskirts of the forest P\u00e9tya had considered he must carry out his instructions strictly and return at once. But when he saw the French and saw T\u00edkhon and learned that there would certainly be an attack that night, he decided, with the rapidity with which young people change their views, that the general, whom he had greatly respected till then, was a rubbishy German, that Den\u00edsov was a hero, the esaul a hero, and T\u00edkhon a hero too, and that it would be shameful for him to leave them at a moment of difficulty.\n\nIt was already growing dusk when Den\u00edsov, P\u00e9tya, and the esaul rode up to the watchhouse. In the twilight saddled horses could be seen, and Cossacks and hussars who had rigged up rough shelters in the glade and were kindling glowing fires in a hollow of the forest where the French could not see the smoke. In the passage of the small watchhouse a Cossack with sleeves rolled up was chopping some mutton. In the room three officers of Den\u00edsov\u2019s band were converting a door into a tabletop. P\u00e9tya took off his wet clothes, gave them to be dried, and at once began helping the officers to fix up the dinner table.\n\nIn ten minutes the table was ready and a napkin spread on it. On the table were vodka, a flask of rum, white bread, roast mutton, and salt.\n\nSitting at table with the officers and tearing the fat savory mutton with his hands, down which the grease trickled, P\u00e9tya was in an ecstatic childish state of love for all men, and consequently of confidence that others loved him in the same way.\n\n\u201cSo then what do you think, Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich?\u201d said he to Den\u00edsov. \u201cIt\u2019s all right my staying a day with you?\u201d And not waiting for a reply he answered his own question: \u201cYou see I was told to find out\u2014well, I am finding out.... Only do let me into the very... into the chief... I don\u2019t want a reward.... But I want...\u201d\n\nP\u00e9tya clenched his teeth and looked around, throwing back his head and flourishing his arms.\n\n\u201cInto the vewy chief...\u201d Den\u00edsov repeated with a smile.\n\n\u201cOnly, please let me command something, so that I may really command...\u201d P\u00e9tya went on. \u201cWhat would it be to you?... Oh, you want a knife?\u201d he said, turning to an officer who wished to cut himself a piece of mutton.\n\nAnd he handed him his clasp knife. The officer admired it.\n\n\u201cPlease keep it. I have several like it,\u201d said P\u00e9tya, blushing. \u201cHeavens! I was quite forgetting!\u201d he suddenly cried. \u201cI have some raisins, fine ones; you know, seedless ones. We have a new sutler and he has such capital things. I bought ten pounds. I am used to something sweet. Would you like some?...\u201d and P\u00e9tya ran out into the passage to his Cossack and brought back some bags which contained about five pounds of raisins. \u201cHave some, gentlemen, have some!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou want a coffeepot, don\u2019t you?\u201d he asked the esaul. \u201cI bought a capital one from our sutler! He has splendid things. And he\u2019s very honest, that\u2019s the chief thing. I\u2019ll be sure to send it to you. Or perhaps your flints are giving out, or are worn out\u2014that happens sometimes, you know. I have brought some with me, here they are\u201d\u2014and he showed a bag\u2014\u201ca hundred flints. I bought them very cheap. Please take as many as you want, or all if you like....\u201d\n\nThen suddenly, dismayed lest he had said too much, P\u00e9tya stopped and blushed.\n\nHe tried to remember whether he had not done anything else that was foolish. And running over the events of the day he remembered the French drummer boy. \u201cIt\u2019s capital for us here, but what of him? Where have they put him? Have they fed him? Haven\u2019t they hurt his feelings?\u201d he thought. But having caught himself saying too much about the flints, he was now afraid to speak out.\n\n\u201cI might ask,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut they\u2019ll say: \u2018He\u2019s a boy himself and so he pities the boy.\u2019 I\u2019ll show them tomorrow whether I\u2019m a boy. Will it seem odd if I ask?\u201d P\u00e9tya thought. \u201cWell, never mind!\u201d and immediately, blushing and looking anxiously at the officers to see if they appeared ironical, he said:\n\n\u201cMay I call in that boy who was taken prisoner and give him something to eat?... Perhaps...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, he\u2019s a poor little fellow,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, who evidently saw nothing shameful in this reminder. \u201cCall him in. His name is Vincent Bosse. Have him fetched.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call him,\u201d said P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, call him. A poor little fellow,\u201d Den\u00edsov repeated.\n\nP\u00e9tya was standing at the door when Den\u00edsov said this. He slipped in between the officers, came close to Den\u00edsov, and said:\n\n\u201cLet me kiss you, dear old fellow! Oh, how fine, how splendid!\u201d\n\nAnd having kissed Den\u00edsov he ran out of the hut.\n\n\u201cBosse! Vincent!\u201d P\u00e9tya cried, stopping outside the door.\n\n\u201cWho do you want, sir?\u201d asked a voice in the darkness.\n\nP\u00e9tya replied that he wanted the French lad who had been captured that day.\n\n\u201cAh, Ves\u00e9nny?\u201d said a Cossack.\n\nVincent, the boy\u2019s name, had already been changed by the Cossacks into Ves\u00e9nny (vernal) and into Ves\u00e9nya by the peasants and soldiers. In both these adaptations the reference to spring (vesn\u00e1) matched the impression made by the young lad.\n\n\u201cHe is warming himself there by the bonfire. Ho, Ves\u00e9nya! Ves\u00e9nya!\u2014Ves\u00e9nny!\u201d laughing voices were heard calling to one another in the darkness.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a smart lad,\u201d said an hussar standing near P\u00e9tya. \u201cWe gave him something to eat a while ago. He was awfully hungry!\u201d\n\nThe sound of bare feet splashing through the mud was heard in the darkness, and the drummer boy came to the door.\n\n\u201cAh, c\u2019est vous!\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cVoulez-vous manger? N\u2019ayez pas peur, on ne vous fera pas de mal,\u201d he added shyly and affectionately, touching the boy\u2019s hand. \u201cEntrez, entrez.\u201d\n\n\u201cMerci, monsieur,\u201d said the drummer boy in a trembling almost childish voice, and he began scraping his dirty feet on the threshold.\n\nThere were many things P\u00e9tya wanted to say to the drummer boy, but did not dare to. He stood irresolutely beside him in the passage. Then in the darkness he took the boy\u2019s hand and pressed it.\n\n\u201cCome in, come in!\u201d he repeated in a gentle whisper. \u201cOh, what can I do for him?\u201d he thought, and opening the door he let the boy pass in first.\n\nWhen the boy had entered the hut, P\u00e9tya sat down at a distance from him, considering it beneath his dignity to pay attention to him. But he fingered the money in his pocket and wondered whether it would seem ridiculous to give some to the drummer boy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nThe arrival of D\u00f3lokhov diverted P\u00e9tya\u2019s attention from the drummer boy, to whom Den\u00edsov had had some mutton and vodka given, and whom he had had dressed in a Russian coat so that he might be kept with their band and not sent away with the other prisoners. P\u00e9tya had heard in the army many stories of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s extraordinary bravery and of his cruelty to the French, so from the moment he entered the hut P\u00e9tya did not take his eyes from him, but braced himself up more and more and held his head high, that he might not be unworthy even of such company.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov\u2019s appearance amazed P\u00e9tya by its simplicity.\n\nDen\u00edsov wore a Cossack coat, had a beard, had an icon of Nicholas the Wonder-Worker on his breast, and his way of speaking and everything he did indicated his unusual position. But D\u00f3lokhov, who in Moscow had worn a Persian costume, had now the appearance of a most correct officer of the Guards. He was clean-shaven and wore a Guardsman\u2019s padded coat with an Order of St. George at his buttonhole and a plain forage cap set straight on his head. He took off his wet felt cloak in a corner of the room, and without greeting anyone went up to Den\u00edsov and began questioning him about the matter in hand. Den\u00edsov told him of the designs the large detachments had on the transport, of the message P\u00e9tya had brought, and his own replies to both generals. Then he told him all he knew of the French detachment.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s so. But we must know what troops they are and their numbers,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. \u201cIt will be necessary to go there. We can\u2019t start the affair without knowing for certain how many there are. I like to work accurately. Here now\u2014wouldn\u2019t one of these gentlemen like to ride over to the French camp with me? I have brought a spare uniform.\u201d\n\n\u201cI, I... I\u2019ll go with you!\u201d cried P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no need for you to go at all,\u201d said Den\u00edsov, addressing D\u00f3lokhov, \u201cand as for him, I won\u2019t let him go on any account.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like that!\u201d exclaimed P\u00e9tya. \u201cWhy shouldn\u2019t I go?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause it\u2019s useless.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you must excuse me, because... because... I shall go, and that\u2019s all. You\u2019ll take me, won\u2019t you?\u201d he said, turning to D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cWhy not?\u201d D\u00f3lokhov answered absently, scrutinizing the face of the French drummer boy. \u201cHave you had that youngster with you long?\u201d he asked Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cHe was taken today but he knows nothing. I\u2019m keeping him with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and where do you put the others?\u201d inquired D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cWhere? I send them away and take a weceipt for them,\u201d shouted Den\u00edsov, suddenly flushing. \u201cAnd I say boldly that I have not a single man\u2019s life on my conscience. Would it be difficult for you to send thirty or thwee hundwed men to town under escort, instead of staining\u2014I speak bluntly\u2014staining the honor of a soldier?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat kind of amiable talk would be suitable from this young count of sixteen,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov with cold irony, \u201cbut it\u2019s time for you to drop it.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, I\u2019ve not said anything! I only say that I\u2019ll certainly go with you,\u201d said P\u00e9tya shyly.\n\n\u201cBut for you and me, old fellow, it\u2019s time to drop these amenities,\u201d continued D\u00f3lokhov, as if he found particular pleasure in speaking of this subject which irritated Den\u00edsov. \u201cNow, why have you kept this lad?\u201d he went on, swaying his head. \u201cBecause you are sorry for him! Don\u2019t we know those \u2018receipts\u2019 of yours? You send a hundred men away, and thirty get there. The rest either starve or get killed. So isn\u2019t it all the same not to send them?\u201d\n\nThe esaul, screwing up his light-colored eyes, nodded approvingly.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s not the point. I\u2019m not going to discuss the matter. I do not wish to take it on my conscience. You say they\u2019ll die. All wight. Only not by my fault!\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov began laughing.\n\n\u201cWho has told them not to capture me these twenty times over? But if they did catch me they\u2019d string me up to an aspen tree, and with all your chivalry just the same.\u201d He paused. \u201cHowever, we must get to work. Tell the Cossack to fetch my kit. I have two French uniforms in it. Well, are you coming with me?\u201d he asked P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cI? Yes, yes, certainly!\u201d cried P\u00e9tya, blushing almost to tears and glancing at Den\u00edsov.\n\nWhile D\u00f3lokhov had been disputing with Den\u00edsov what should be done with prisoners, P\u00e9tya had once more felt awkward and restless; but again he had no time to grasp fully what they were talking about. \u201cIf grown-up, distinguished men think so, it must be necessary and right,\u201d thought he. \u201cBut above all Den\u00edsov must not dare to imagine that I\u2019ll obey him and that he can order me about. I will certainly go to the French camp with D\u00f3lokhov. If he can, so can I!\u201d\n\nAnd to all Den\u00edsov\u2019s persuasions, P\u00e9tya replied that he too was accustomed to do everything accurately and not just anyhow, and that he never considered personal danger.\n\n\u201cFor you\u2019ll admit that if we don\u2019t know for sure how many of them there are... hundreds of lives may depend on it, while there are only two of us. Besides, I want to go very much and certainly will go, so don\u2019t hinder me,\u201d said he. \u201cIt will only make things worse....\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nHaving put on French greatcoats and shakos, P\u00e9tya and D\u00f3lokhov rode to the clearing from which Den\u00edsov had reconnoitered the French camp, and emerging from the forest in pitch darkness they descended into the hollow. On reaching the bottom, D\u00f3lokhov told the Cossacks accompanying him to await him there and rode on at a quick trot along the road to the bridge. P\u00e9tya, his heart in his mouth with excitement, rode by his side.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re caught, I won\u2019t be taken alive! I have a pistol,\u201d whispered he.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t talk Russian,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov in a hurried whisper, and at that very moment they heard through the darkness the challenge: \u201cQui vive?\u201d and the click of a musket.\n\nThe blood rushed to P\u00e9tya\u2019s face and he grasped his pistol.\n\n\u201cLanciers du 6-me,\u201d replied D\u00f3lokhov, neither hastening nor slackening his horse\u2019s pace.\n\nThe black figure of a sentinel stood on the bridge.\n\n\u201cMot d\u2019ordre.\u201d\n\nD\u00f3lokhov reined in his horse and advanced at a walk.\n\n\u201cDites donc, le colonel G\u00e9rard est ici?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cMot d\u2019ordre,\u201d repeated the sentinel, barring the way and not replying.\n\n\u201cQuand un officier fait sa ronde, les sentinelles ne demandent pas le mot d\u2019ordre...\u201d cried D\u00f3lokhov suddenly flaring up and riding straight at the sentinel. \u201cJe vous demande si le colonel est ici.\u201d\n\nAnd without waiting for an answer from the sentinel, who had stepped aside, D\u00f3lokhov rode up the incline at a walk.\n\nNoticing the black outline of a man crossing the road, D\u00f3lokhov stopped him and inquired where the commander and officers were. The man, a soldier with a sack over his shoulder, stopped, came close up to D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s horse, touched it with his hand, and explained simply and in a friendly way that the commander and the officers were higher up the hill to the right in the courtyard of the farm, as he called the landowner\u2019s house.\n\nHaving ridden up the road, on both sides of which French talk could be heard around the campfires, D\u00f3lokhov turned into the courtyard of the landowner\u2019s house. Having ridden in, he dismounted and approached a big blazing campfire, around which sat several men talking noisily. Something was boiling in a small cauldron at the edge of the fire and a soldier in a peaked cap and blue overcoat, lit up by the fire, was kneeling beside it stirring its contents with a ramrod.\n\n\u201cOh, he\u2019s a hard nut to crack,\u201d said one of the officers who was sitting in the shadow at the other side of the fire.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll make them get a move on, those fellows!\u201d said another, laughing.\n\nBoth fell silent, peering out through the darkness at the sound of D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s and P\u00e9tya\u2019s steps as they advanced to the fire leading their horses.\n\n\u201cBonjour, messieurs!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov loudly and clearly.\n\nThere was a stir among the officers in the shadow beyond the fire, and one tall, long-necked officer, walking round the fire, came up to D\u00f3lokhov.\n\n\u201cIs that you, Cl\u00e9ment?\u201d he asked. \u201cWhere the devil...?\u201d But, noticing his mistake, he broke off short and, with a frown, greeted D\u00f3lokhov as a stranger, asking what he could do for him.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov said that he and his companion were trying to overtake their regiment, and addressing the company in general asked whether they knew anything of the 6th Regiment. None of them knew anything, and P\u00e9tya thought the officers were beginning to look at him and D\u00f3lokhov with hostility and suspicion. For some seconds all were silent.\n\n\u201cIf you were counting on the evening soup, you have come too late,\u201d said a voice from behind the fire with a repressed laugh.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov replied that they were not hungry and must push on farther that night.\n\nHe handed the horses over to the soldier who was stirring the pot and squatted down on his heels by the fire beside the officer with the long neck. That officer did not take his eyes from D\u00f3lokhov and again asked to what regiment he belonged. D\u00f3lokhov, as if he had not heard the question, did not reply, but lighting a short French pipe which he took from his pocket began asking the officer in how far the road before them was safe from Cossacks.\n\n\u201cThose brigands are everywhere,\u201d replied an officer from behind the fire.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov remarked that the Cossacks were a danger only to stragglers such as his companion and himself, \u201cbut probably they would not dare to attack large detachments?\u201d he added inquiringly. No one replied.\n\n\u201cWell, now he\u2019ll come away,\u201d P\u00e9tya thought every moment as he stood by the campfire listening to the talk.\n\nBut D\u00f3lokhov restarted the conversation which had dropped and began putting direct questions as to how many men there were in the battalion, how many battalions, and how many prisoners. Asking about the Russian prisoners with that detachment, D\u00f3lokhov said:\n\n\u201cA horrid business dragging these corpses about with one! It would be better to shoot such rabble,\u201d and burst into loud laughter, so strange that P\u00e9tya thought the French would immediately detect their disguise, and involuntarily took a step back from the campfire.\n\nNo one replied a word to D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s laughter, and a French officer whom they could not see (he lay wrapped in a greatcoat) rose and whispered something to a companion. D\u00f3lokhov got up and called to the soldier who was holding their horses.\n\n\u201cWill they bring our horses or not?\u201d thought P\u00e9tya, instinctively drawing nearer to D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nThe horses were brought.\n\n\u201cGood evening, gentlemen,\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov.\n\nP\u00e9tya wished to say \u201cGood night\u201d but could not utter a word. The officers were whispering together. D\u00f3lokhov was a long time mounting his horse which would not stand still, then he rode out of the yard at a footpace. P\u00e9tya rode beside him, longing to look round to see whether or not the French were running after them, but not daring to.\n\nComing out onto the road D\u00f3lokhov did not ride back across the open country, but through the village. At one spot he stopped and listened. \u201cDo you hear?\u201d he asked. P\u00e9tya recognized the sound of Russian voices and saw the dark figures of Russian prisoners round their campfires. When they had descended to the bridge P\u00e9tya and D\u00f3lokhov rode past the sentinel, who without saying a word paced morosely up and down it, then they descended into the hollow where the Cossacks awaited them.\n\n\u201cWell now, good-by. Tell Den\u00edsov, \u2018at the first shot at daybreak,\u2019\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov and was about to ride away, but P\u00e9tya seized hold of him.\n\n\u201cReally!\u201d he cried, \u201cyou are such a hero! Oh, how fine, how splendid! How I love you!\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right, all right!\u201d said D\u00f3lokhov. But P\u00e9tya did not let go of him and D\u00f3lokhov saw through the gloom that P\u00e9tya was bending toward him and wanted to kiss him. D\u00f3lokhov kissed him, laughed, turned his horse, and vanished into the darkness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nHaving returned to the watchman\u2019s hut, P\u00e9tya found Den\u00edsov in the passage. He was awaiting P\u00e9tya\u2019s return in a state of agitation, anxiety, and self-reproach for having let him go.\n\n\u201cThank God!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201cYes, thank God!\u201d he repeated, listening to P\u00e9tya\u2019s rapturous account. \u201cBut, devil take you, I haven\u2019t slept because of you! Well, thank God. Now lie down. We can still get a nap before morning.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut... no,\u201d said P\u00e9tya, \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep yet. Besides I know myself, if I fall asleep it\u2019s finished. And then I am used to not sleeping before a battle.\u201d\n\nHe sat awhile in the hut joyfully recalling the details of his expedition and vividly picturing to himself what would happen next day.\n\nThen, noticing that Den\u00edsov was asleep, he rose and went out of doors.\n\nIt was still quite dark outside. The rain was over, but drops were still falling from the trees. Near the watchman\u2019s hut the black shapes of the Cossacks\u2019 shanties and of horses tethered together could be seen. Behind the hut the dark shapes of the two wagons with their horses beside them were discernible, and in the hollow the dying campfire gleamed red. Not all the Cossacks and hussars were asleep; here and there, amid the sounds of falling drops and the munching of the horses near by, could be heard low voices which seemed to be whispering.\n\nP\u00e9tya came out, peered into the darkness, and went up to the wagons. Someone was snoring under them, and around them stood saddled horses munching their oats. In the dark P\u00e9tya recognized his own horse, which he called \u201cKarab\u00e1kh\u201d though it was of Ukranian breed, and went up to it.\n\n\u201cWell, Karab\u00e1kh! We\u2019ll do some service tomorrow,\u201d said he, sniffing its nostrils and kissing it.\n\n\u201cWhy aren\u2019t you asleep, sir?\u201d said a Cossack who was sitting under a wagon.\n\n\u201cNo, ah... Likhach\u00ebv\u2014isn\u2019t that your name? Do you know I have only just come back! We\u2019ve been into the French camp.\u201d\n\nAnd P\u00e9tya gave the Cossack a detailed account not only of his ride but also of his object, and why he considered it better to risk his life than to act \u201cjust anyhow.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you should get some sleep now,\u201d said the Cossack.\n\n\u201cNo, I am used to this,\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cI say, aren\u2019t the flints in your pistols worn out? I brought some with me. Don\u2019t you want any? You can have some.\u201d\n\nThe Cossack bent forward from under the wagon to get a closer look at P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cBecause I am accustomed to doing everything accurately,\u201d said P\u00e9tya. \u201cSome fellows do things just anyhow, without preparation, and then they\u2019re sorry for it afterwards. I don\u2019t like that.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so,\u201d said the Cossack.\n\n\u201cOh yes, another thing! Please, my dear fellow, will you sharpen my saber for me? It\u2019s got bl...\u201d (P\u00e9tya feared to tell a lie, and the saber never had been sharpened.) \u201cCan you do it?\u201d\n\n\u201cOf course I can.\u201d\n\nLikhach\u00ebv got up, rummaged in his pack, and soon P\u00e9tya heard the warlike sound of steel on whetstone. He climbed onto the wagon and sat on its edge. The Cossack was sharpening the saber under the wagon.\n\n\u201cI say! Are the lads asleep?\u201d asked P\u00e9tya.\n\n\u201cSome are, and some aren\u2019t\u2014like us.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and that boy?\u201d\n\n\u201cVes\u00e9nny? Oh, he\u2019s thrown himself down there in the passage. Fast asleep after his fright. He was that glad!\u201d\n\nAfter that P\u00e9tya remained silent for a long time, listening to the sounds. He heard footsteps in the darkness and a black figure appeared.\n\n\u201cWhat are you sharpening?\u201d asked a man coming up to the wagon.\n\n\u201cWhy, this gentleman\u2019s saber.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d said the man, whom P\u00e9tya took to be an hussar. \u201cWas the cup left here?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere, by the wheel!\u201d\n\nThe hussar took the cup.\n\n\u201cIt must be daylight soon,\u201d said he, yawning, and went away.\n\nP\u00e9tya ought to have known that he was in a forest with Den\u00edsov\u2019s guerrilla band, less than a mile from the road, sitting on a wagon captured from the French beside which horses were tethered, that under it Likhach\u00ebv was sitting sharpening a saber for him, that the big dark blotch to the right was the watchman\u2019s hut, and the red blotch below to the left was the dying embers of a campfire, that the man who had come for the cup was an hussar who wanted a drink; but he neither knew nor waited to know anything of all this. He was in a fairy kingdom where nothing resembled reality. The big dark blotch might really be the watchman\u2019s hut or it might be a cavern leading to the very depths of the earth. Perhaps the red spot was a fire, or it might be the eye of an enormous monster. Perhaps he was really sitting on a wagon, but it might very well be that he was not sitting on a wagon but on a terribly high tower from which, if he fell, he would have to fall for a whole day or a whole month, or go on falling and never reach the bottom. Perhaps it was just the Cossack, Likhach\u00ebv, who was sitting under the wagon, but it might be the kindest, bravest, most wonderful, most splendid man in the world, whom no one knew of. It might really have been that the hussar came for water and went back into the hollow, but perhaps he had simply vanished\u2014disappeared altogether and dissolved into nothingness.\n\nNothing P\u00e9tya could have seen now would have surprised him. He was in a fairy kingdom where everything was possible.\n\nHe looked up at the sky. And the sky was a fairy realm like the earth. It was clearing, and over the tops of the trees clouds were swiftly sailing as if unveiling the stars. Sometimes it looked as if the clouds were passing, and a clear black sky appeared. Sometimes it seemed as if the black spaces were clouds. Sometimes the sky seemed to be rising high, high overhead, and then it seemed to sink so low that one could touch it with one\u2019s hand.\n\nP\u00e9tya\u2019s eyes began to close and he swayed a little.\n\nThe trees were dripping. Quiet talking was heard. The horses neighed and jostled one another. Someone snored.\n\n\u201cOzheg-zheg, Ozheg-zheg...\u201d hissed the saber against the whetstone, and suddenly P\u00e9tya heard an harmonious orchestra playing some unknown, sweetly solemn hymn. P\u00e9tya was as musical as Nat\u00e1sha and more so than Nicholas, but had never learned music or thought about it, and so the melody that unexpectedly came to his mind seemed to him particularly fresh and attractive. The music became more and more audible. The melody grew and passed from one instrument to another. And what was played was a fugue\u2014though P\u00e9tya had not the least conception of what a fugue is. Each instrument\u2014now resembling a violin and now a horn, but better and clearer than violin or horn\u2014played its own part, and before it had finished the melody merged with another instrument that began almost the same air, and then with a third and a fourth; and they all blended into one and again became separate and again blended, now into solemn church music, now into something dazzlingly brilliant and triumphant.\n\n\u201cOh\u2014why, that was in a dream!\u201d P\u00e9tya said to himself, as he lurched forward. \u201cIt\u2019s in my ears. But perhaps it\u2019s music of my own. Well, go on, my music! Now!...\u201d\n\nHe closed his eyes, and, from all sides as if from a distance, sounds fluttered, grew into harmonies, separated, blended, and again all mingled into the same sweet and solemn hymn. \u201cOh, this is delightful! As much as I like and as I like!\u201d said P\u00e9tya to himself. He tried to conduct that enormous orchestra.\n\n\u201cNow softly, softly die away!\u201d and the sounds obeyed him. \u201cNow fuller, more joyful. Still more and more joyful!\u201d And from an unknown depth rose increasingly triumphant sounds. \u201cNow voices join in!\u201d ordered P\u00e9tya. And at first from afar he heard men\u2019s voices and then women\u2019s. The voices grew in harmonious triumphant strength, and P\u00e9tya listened to their surpassing beauty in awe and joy.\n\nWith a solemn triumphal march there mingled a song, the drip from the trees, and the hissing of the saber, \u201cOzheg-zheg-zheg...\u201d and again the horses jostled one another and neighed, not disturbing the choir but joining in it.\n\nP\u00e9tya did not know how long this lasted: he enjoyed himself all the time, wondered at his enjoyment and regretted that there was no one to share it. He was awakened by Likhach\u00ebv\u2019s kindly voice.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s ready, your honor; you can split a Frenchman in half with it!\u201d\n\nP\u00e9tya woke up.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s getting light, it\u2019s really getting light!\u201d he exclaimed.\n\nThe horses that had previously been invisible could now be seen to their very tails, and a watery light showed itself through the bare branches. P\u00e9tya shook himself, jumped up, took a ruble from his pocket and gave it to Likhach\u00ebv; then he flourished the saber, tested it, and sheathed it. The Cossacks were untying their horses and tightening their saddle girths.\n\n\u201cAnd here\u2019s the commander,\u201d said Likhach\u00ebv.\n\nDen\u00edsov came out of the watchman\u2019s hut and, having called P\u00e9tya, gave orders to get ready.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nThe men rapidly picked out their horses in the semidarkness, tightened their saddle girths, and formed companies. Den\u00edsov stood by the watchman\u2019s hut giving final orders. The infantry of the detachment passed along the road and quickly disappeared amid the trees in the mist of early dawn, hundreds of feet splashing through the mud. The esaul gave some orders to his men. P\u00e9tya held his horse by the bridle, impatiently awaiting the order to mount. His face, having been bathed in cold water, was all aglow, and his eyes were particularly brilliant. Cold shivers ran down his spine and his whole body pulsed rhythmically.\n\n\u201cWell, is ev\u2019wything weady?\u201d asked Den\u00edsov. \u201cBwing the horses.\u201d\n\nThe horses were brought. Den\u00edsov was angry with the Cossack because the saddle girths were too slack, reproved him, and mounted. P\u00e9tya put his foot in the stirrup. His horse by habit made as if to nip his leg, but P\u00e9tya leaped quickly into the saddle unconscious of his own weight and, turning to look at the hussars starting in the darkness behind him, rode up to Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cVas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich, entrust me with some commission! Please... for God\u2019s sake...!\u201d said he.\n\nDen\u00edsov seemed to have forgotten P\u00e9tya\u2019s very existence. He turned to glance at him.\n\n\u201cI ask one thing of you,\u201d he said sternly, \u201cto obey me and not shove yourself forward anywhere.\u201d\n\nHe did not say another word to P\u00e9tya but rode in silence all the way. When they had come to the edge of the forest it was noticeably growing light over the field. Den\u00edsov talked in whispers with the esaul and the Cossacks rode past P\u00e9tya and Den\u00edsov. When they had all ridden by, Den\u00edsov touched his horse and rode down the hill. Slipping onto their haunches and sliding, the horses descended with their riders into the ravine. P\u00e9tya rode beside Den\u00edsov, the pulsation of his body constantly increasing. It was getting lighter and lighter, but the mist still hid distant objects. Having reached the valley, Den\u00edsov looked back and nodded to a Cossack beside him.\n\n\u201cThe signal!\u201d said he.\n\nThe Cossack raised his arm and a shot rang out. In an instant the tramp of horses galloping forward was heard, shouts came from various sides, and then more shots.\n\nAt the first sound of trampling hoofs and shouting, P\u00e9tya lashed his horse and loosening his rein galloped forward, not heeding Den\u00edsov who shouted at him. It seemed to P\u00e9tya that at the moment the shot was fired it suddenly became as bright as noon. He galloped to the bridge. Cossacks were galloping along the road in front of him. On the bridge he collided with a Cossack who had fallen behind, but he galloped on. In front of him soldiers, probably Frenchmen, were running from right to left across the road. One of them fell in the mud under his horse\u2019s feet.\n\nCossacks were crowding about a hut, busy with something. From the midst of that crowd terrible screams arose. P\u00e9tya galloped up, and the first thing he saw was the pale face and trembling jaw of a Frenchman, clutching the handle of a lance that had been aimed at him.\n\n\u201cHurrah!... Lads!... ours!\u201d shouted P\u00e9tya, and giving rein to his excited horse he galloped forward along the village street.\n\nHe could hear shooting ahead of him. Cossacks, hussars, and ragged Russian prisoners, who had come running from both sides of the road, were shouting something loudly and incoherently. A gallant-looking Frenchman, in a blue overcoat, capless, and with a frowning red face, had been defending himself against the hussars. When P\u00e9tya galloped up the Frenchman had already fallen. \u201cToo late again!\u201d flashed through P\u00e9tya\u2019s mind and he galloped on to the place from which the rapid firing could be heard. The shots came from the yard of the landowner\u2019s house he had visited the night before with D\u00f3lokhov. The French were making a stand there behind a wattle fence in a garden thickly overgrown with bushes and were firing at the Cossacks who crowded at the gateway. Through the smoke, as he approached the gate, P\u00e9tya saw D\u00f3lokhov, whose face was of a pale-greenish tint, shouting to his men. \u201cGo round! Wait for the infantry!\u201d he exclaimed as P\u00e9tya rode up to him.\n\n\u201cWait?... Hurrah-ah-ah!\u201d shouted P\u00e9tya, and without pausing a moment galloped to the place whence came the sounds of firing and where the smoke was thickest.\n\nA volley was heard, and some bullets whistled past, while others plashed against something. The Cossacks and D\u00f3lokhov galloped after P\u00e9tya into the gateway of the courtyard. In the dense wavering smoke some of the French threw down their arms and ran out of the bushes to meet the Cossacks, while others ran down the hill toward the pond. P\u00e9tya was galloping along the courtyard, but instead of holding the reins he waved both his arms about rapidly and strangely, slipping farther and farther to one side in his saddle. His horse, having galloped up to a campfire that was smoldering in the morning light, stopped suddenly, and P\u00e9tya fell heavily on to the wet ground. The Cossacks saw that his arms and legs jerked rapidly though his head was quite motionless. A bullet had pierced his skull.\n\nAfter speaking to the senior French officer, who came out of the house with a white handkerchief tied to his sword and announced that they surrendered, D\u00f3lokhov dismounted and went up to P\u00e9tya, who lay motionless with outstretched arms.\n\n\u201cDone for!\u201d he said with a frown, and went to the gate to meet Den\u00edsov who was riding toward him.\n\n\u201cKilled?\u201d cried Den\u00edsov, recognizing from a distance the unmistakably lifeless attitude\u2014very familiar to him\u2014in which P\u00e9tya\u2019s body was lying.\n\n\u201cDone for!\u201d repeated D\u00f3lokhov as if the utterance of these words afforded him pleasure, and he went quickly up to the prisoners, who were surrounded by Cossacks who had hurried up. \u201cWe won\u2019t take them!\u201d he called out to Den\u00edsov.\n\nDen\u00edsov did not reply; he rode up to P\u00e9tya, dismounted, and with trembling hands turned toward himself the bloodstained, mud-bespattered face which had already gone white.\n\n\u201cI am used to something sweet. Raisins, fine ones... take them all!\u201d he recalled P\u00e9tya\u2019s words. And the Cossacks looked round in surprise at the sound, like the yelp of a dog, with which Den\u00edsov turned away, walked to the wattle fence, and seized hold of it.\n\nAmong the Russian prisoners rescued by Den\u00edsov and D\u00f3lokhov was Pierre Bez\u00fakhov.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nDuring the whole of their march from Moscow no fresh orders had been issued by the French authorities concerning the party of prisoners among whom was Pierre. On the twenty-second of October that party was no longer with the same troops and baggage trains with which it had left Moscow. Half the wagons laden with hardtack that had traveled the first stages with them had been captured by Cossacks, the other half had gone on ahead. Not one of those dismounted cavalrymen who had marched in front of the prisoners was left; they had all disappeared. The artillery the prisoners had seen in front of them during the first days was now replaced by Marshal Junot\u2019s enormous baggage train, convoyed by Westphalians. Behind the prisoners came a cavalry baggage train.\n\nFrom Vy\u00e1zma onwards the French army, which had till then moved in three columns, went on as a single group. The symptoms of disorder that Pierre had noticed at their first halting place after leaving Moscow had now reached the utmost limit.\n\nThe road along which they moved was bordered on both sides by dead horses; ragged men who had fallen behind from various regiments continually changed about, now joining the moving column, now again lagging behind it.\n\nSeveral times during the march false alarms had been given and the soldiers of the escort had raised their muskets, fired, and run headlong, crushing one another, but had afterwards reassembled and abused each other for their causeless panic.\n\nThese three groups traveling together\u2014the cavalry stores, the convoy of prisoners, and Junot\u2019s baggage train\u2014still constituted a separate and united whole, though each of the groups was rapidly melting away.\n\nOf the artillery baggage train which had consisted of a hundred and twenty wagons, not more than sixty now remained; the rest had been captured or left behind. Some of Junot\u2019s wagons also had been captured or abandoned. Three wagons had been raided and robbed by stragglers from Davout\u2019s corps. From the talk of the Germans Pierre learned that a larger guard had been allotted to that baggage train than to the prisoners, and that one of their comrades, a German soldier, had been shot by the marshal\u2019s own order because a silver spoon belonging to the marshal had been found in his possession.\n\nThe group of prisoners had melted away most of all. Of the three hundred and thirty men who had set out from Moscow fewer than a hundred now remained. The prisoners were more burdensome to the escort than even the cavalry saddles or Junot\u2019s baggage. They understood that the saddles and Junot\u2019s spoon might be of some use, but that cold and hungry soldiers should have to stand and guard equally cold and hungry Russians who froze and lagged behind on the road (in which case the order was to shoot them) was not merely incomprehensible but revolting. And the escort, as if afraid, in the grievous condition they themselves were in, of giving way to the pity they felt for the prisoners and so rendering their own plight still worse, treated them with particular moroseness and severity.\n\nAt Dorogob\u00fazh while the soldiers of the convoy, after locking the prisoners in a stable, had gone off to pillage their own stores, several of the soldier prisoners tunneled under the wall and ran away, but were recaptured by the French and shot.\n\nThe arrangement adopted when they started, that the officer prisoners should be kept separate from the rest, had long since been abandoned. All who could walk went together, and after the third stage Pierre had rejoined Karat\u00e1ev and the gray-blue bandy-legged dog that had chosen Karat\u00e1ev for its master.\n\nOn the third day after leaving Moscow Karat\u00e1ev again fell ill with the fever he had suffered from in the hospital in Moscow, and as he grew gradually weaker Pierre kept away from him. Pierre did not know why, but since Karat\u00e1ev had begun to grow weaker it had cost him an effort to go near him. When he did so and heard the subdued moaning with which Karat\u00e1ev generally lay down at the halting places, and when he smelled the odor emanating from him which was now stronger than before, Pierre moved farther away and did not think about him.\n\nWhile imprisoned in the shed Pierre had learned not with his intellect but with his whole being, by life itself, that man is created for happiness, that happiness is within him, in the satisfaction of simple human needs, and that all unhappiness arises not from privation but from superfluity. And now during these last three weeks of the march he had learned still another new, consolatory truth\u2014that nothing in this world is terrible. He had learned that as there is no condition in which man can be happy and entirely free, so there is no condition in which he need be unhappy and lack freedom. He learned that suffering and freedom have their limits and that those limits are very near together; that the person in a bed of roses with one crumpled petal suffered as keenly as he now, sleeping on the bare damp earth with one side growing chilled while the other was warming; and that when he had put on tight dancing shoes he had suffered just as he did now when he walked with bare feet that were covered with sores\u2014his footgear having long since fallen to pieces. He discovered that when he had married his wife\u2014of his own free will as it had seemed to him\u2014he had been no more free than now when they locked him up at night in a stable. Of all that he himself subsequently termed his sufferings, but which at the time he scarcely felt, the worst was the state of his bare, raw, and scab-covered feet. (The horseflesh was appetizing and nourishing, the saltpeter flavor of the gunpowder they used instead of salt was even pleasant; there was no great cold, it was always warm walking in the daytime, and at night there were the campfires; the lice that devoured him warmed his body.) The one thing that was at first hard to bear was his feet.\n\nAfter the second day\u2019s march Pierre, having examined his feet by the campfire, thought it would be impossible to walk on them; but when everybody got up he went along, limping, and, when he had warmed up, walked without feeling the pain, though at night his feet were more terrible to look at than before. However, he did not look at them now, but thought of other things.\n\nOnly now did Pierre realize the full strength of life in man and the saving power he has of transferring his attention from one thing to another, which is like the safety valve of a boiler that allows superfluous steam to blow off when the pressure exceeds a certain limit.\n\nHe did not see and did not hear how they shot the prisoners who lagged behind, though more than a hundred perished in that way. He did not think of Karat\u00e1ev who grew weaker every day and evidently would soon have to share that fate. Still less did Pierre think about himself. The harder his position became and the more terrible the future, the more independent of that position in which he found himself were the joyful and comforting thoughts, memories, and imaginings that came to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nAt midday on the twenty-second of October Pierre was going uphill along the muddy, slippery road, looking at his feet and at the roughness of the way. Occasionally he glanced at the familiar crowd around him and then again at his feet. The former and the latter were alike familiar and his own. The blue-gray bandy legged dog ran merrily along the side of the road, sometimes in proof of its agility and self-satisfaction lifting one hind leg and hopping along on three, and then again going on all four and rushing to bark at the crows that sat on the carrion. The dog was merrier and sleeker than it had been in Moscow. All around lay the flesh of different animals\u2014from men to horses\u2014in various stages of decomposition; and as the wolves were kept off by the passing men the dog could eat all it wanted.\n\nIt had been raining since morning and had seemed as if at any moment it might cease and the sky clear, but after a short break it began raining harder than before. The saturated road no longer absorbed the water, which ran along the ruts in streams.\n\nPierre walked along, looking from side to side, counting his steps in threes, and reckoning them off on his fingers. Mentally addressing the rain, he repeated: \u201cNow then, now then, go on! Pelt harder!\u201d\n\nIt seemed to him that he was thinking of nothing, but far down and deep within him his soul was occupied with something important and comforting. This something was a most subtle spiritual deduction from a conversation with Karat\u00e1ev the day before.\n\nAt their yesterday\u2019s halting place, feeling chilly by a dying campfire, Pierre had got up and gone to the next one, which was burning better. There Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev was sitting covered up\u2014head and all\u2014with his greatcoat as if it were a vestment, telling the soldiers in his effective and pleasant though now feeble voice a story Pierre knew. It was already past midnight, the hour when Karat\u00e1ev was usually free of his fever and particularly lively. When Pierre reached the fire and heard Plat\u00f3n\u2019s voice enfeebled by illness, and saw his pathetic face brightly lit up by the blaze, he felt a painful prick at his heart. His feeling of pity for this man frightened him and he wished to go away, but there was no other fire, and Pierre sat down, trying not to look at Plat\u00f3n.\n\n\u201cWell, how are you?\u201d he asked.\n\n\u201cHow am I? If we grumble at sickness, God won\u2019t grant us death,\u201d replied Plat\u00f3n, and at once resumed the story he had begun.\n\n\u201cAnd so, brother,\u201d he continued, with a smile on his pale emaciated face and a particularly happy light in his eyes, \u201cyou see, brother...\u201d\n\nPierre had long been familiar with that story. Karat\u00e1ev had told it to him alone some half-dozen times and always with a specially joyful emotion. But well as he knew it, Pierre now listened to that tale as to something new, and the quiet rapture Karat\u00e1ev evidently felt as he told it communicated itself also to Pierre. The story was of an old merchant who lived a good and God-fearing life with his family, and who went once to the N\u00edzhni fair with a companion\u2014a rich merchant.\n\nHaving put up at an inn they both went to sleep, and next morning his companion was found robbed and with his throat cut. A bloodstained knife was found under the old merchant\u2019s pillow. He was tried, knouted, and his nostrils having been torn off, \u201call in due form\u201d as Karat\u00e1ev put it, he was sent to hard labor in Siberia.\n\n\u201cAnd so, brother\u201d (it was at this point that Pierre came up), \u201cten years or more passed by. The old man was living as a convict, submitting as he should and doing no wrong. Only he prayed to God for death. Well, one night the convicts were gathered just as we are, with the old man among them. And they began telling what each was suffering for, and how they had sinned against God. One told how he had taken a life, another had taken two, a third had set a house on fire, while another had simply been a vagrant and had done nothing. So they asked the old man: \u2018What are you being punished for, Daddy?\u2019\u2014\u2018I, my dear brothers,\u2019 said he, \u2018am being punished for my own and other men\u2019s sins. But I have not killed anyone or taken anything that was not mine, but have only helped my poorer brothers. I was a merchant, my dear brothers, and had much property. \u2018And he went on to tell them all about it in due order. \u2018I don\u2019t grieve for myself,\u2019 he says, \u2018God, it seems, has chastened me. Only I am sorry for my old wife and the children,\u2019 and the old man began to weep. Now it happened that in the group was the very man who had killed the other merchant. \u2018Where did it happen, Daddy?\u2019 he said. \u2018When, and in what month?\u2019 He asked all about it and his heart began to ache. So he comes up to the old man like this, and falls down at his feet! \u2018You are perishing because of me, Daddy,\u2019 he says. \u2018It\u2019s quite true, lads, that this man,\u2019 he says, \u2018is being tortured innocently and for nothing! I,\u2019 he says, \u2018did that deed, and I put the knife under your head while you were asleep. Forgive me, Daddy,\u2019 he says, \u2018for Christ\u2019s sake!\u2019\u201d\n\nKarat\u00e1ev paused, smiling joyously as he gazed into the fire, and he drew the logs together.\n\n\u201cAnd the old man said, \u2018God will forgive you, we are all sinners in His sight. I suffer for my own sins,\u2019 and he wept bitter tears. Well, and what do you think, dear friends?\u201d Karat\u00e1ev continued, his face brightening more and more with a rapturous smile as if what he now had to tell contained the chief charm and the whole meaning of his story: \u201cWhat do you think, dear fellows? That murderer confessed to the authorities. \u2018I have taken six lives,\u2019 he says (he was a great sinner), \u2018but what I am most sorry for is this old man. Don\u2019t let him suffer because of me.\u2019 So he confessed and it was all written down and the papers sent off in due form. The place was a long way off, and while they were judging, what with one thing and another, filling in the papers all in due form\u2014the authorities I mean\u2014time passed. The affair reached the Tsar. After a while the Tsar\u2019s decree came: to set the merchant free and give him a compensation that had been awarded. The paper arrived and they began to look for the old man. \u2018Where is the old man who has been suffering innocently and in vain? A paper has come from the Tsar!\u2019 so they began looking for him,\u201d here Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s lower jaw trembled, \u201cbut God had already forgiven him\u2014he was dead! That\u2019s how it was, dear fellows!\u201d Karat\u00e1ev concluded and sat for a long time silent, gazing before him with a smile.\n\nAnd Pierre\u2019s soul was dimly but joyfully filled not by the story itself but by its mysterious significance: by the rapturous joy that lit up Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s face as he told it, and the mystic significance of that joy.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\n\u201c\u00c0 vos places!\u201d suddenly cried a voice.\n\nA pleasant feeling of excitement and an expectation of something joyful and solemn was aroused among the soldiers of the convoy and the prisoners. From all sides came shouts of command, and from the left came smartly dressed cavalrymen on good horses, passing the prisoners at a trot. The expression on all faces showed the tension people feel at the approach of those in authority. The prisoners thronged together and were pushed off the road. The convoy formed up.\n\n\u201cThe Emperor! The Emperor! The Marshal! The Duke!\u201d and hardly had the sleek cavalry passed, before a carriage drawn by six gray horses rattled by. Pierre caught a glimpse of a man in a three-cornered hat with a tranquil look on his handsome, plump, white face. It was one of the marshals. His eye fell on Pierre\u2019s large and striking figure, and in the expression with which he frowned and looked away Pierre thought he detected sympathy and a desire to conceal that sympathy.\n\nThe general in charge of the stores galloped after the carriage with a red and frightened face, whipping up his skinny horse. Several officers formed a group and some soldiers crowded round them. Their faces all looked excited and worried.\n\n\u201cWhat did he say? What did he say?\u201d Pierre heard them ask.\n\nWhile the marshal was passing, the prisoners had huddled together in a crowd, and Pierre saw Karat\u00e1ev whom he had not yet seen that morning. He sat in his short overcoat leaning against a birch tree. On his face, besides the look of joyful emotion it had worn yesterday while telling the tale of the merchant who suffered innocently, there was now an expression of quiet solemnity.\n\nKarat\u00e1ev looked at Pierre with his kindly round eyes now filled with tears, evidently wishing him to come near that he might say something to him. But Pierre was not sufficiently sure of himself. He made as if he did not notice that look and moved hastily away.\n\nWhen the prisoners again went forward Pierre looked round. Karat\u00e1ev was still sitting at the side of the road under the birch tree and two Frenchmen were talking over his head. Pierre did not look round again but went limping up the hill.\n\nFrom behind, where Karat\u00e1ev had been sitting, came the sound of a shot. Pierre heard it plainly, but at that moment he remembered that he had not yet finished reckoning up how many stages still remained to Smol\u00e9nsk\u2014a calculation he had begun before the marshal went by. And he again started reckoning. Two French soldiers ran past Pierre, one of whom carried a lowered and smoking gun. They both looked pale, and in the expression on their faces\u2014one of them glanced timidly at Pierre\u2014there was something resembling what he had seen on the face of the young soldier at the execution. Pierre looked at the soldier and remembered that, two days before, that man had burned his shirt while drying it at the fire and how they had laughed at him.\n\nBehind him, where Karat\u00e1ev had been sitting, the dog began to howl. \u201cWhat a stupid beast! Why is it howling?\u201d thought Pierre.\n\nHis comrades, the prisoner soldiers walking beside him, avoided looking back at the place where the shot had been fired and the dog was howling, just as Pierre did, but there was a set look on all their faces.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe stores, the prisoners, and the marshal\u2019s baggage train stopped at the village of Sh\u00e1mshevo. The men crowded together round the campfires. Pierre went up to the fire, ate some roast horseflesh, lay down with his back to the fire, and immediately fell asleep. He again slept as he had done at Mozh\u00e1ysk after the battle of Borodin\u00f3.\n\nAgain real events mingled with dreams and again someone, he or another, gave expression to his thoughts, and even to the same thoughts that had been expressed in his dream at Mozh\u00e1ysk.\n\n\u201cLife is everything. Life is God. Everything changes and moves and that movement is God. And while there is life there is joy in consciousness of the divine. To love life is to love God. Harder and more blessed than all else is to love this life in one\u2019s sufferings, in innocent sufferings.\u201d\n\n\u201cKarat\u00e1ev!\u201d came to Pierre\u2019s mind.\n\nAnd suddenly he saw vividly before him a long-forgotten, kindly old man who had given him geography lessons in Switzerland. \u201cWait a bit,\u201d said the old man, and showed Pierre a globe. This globe was alive\u2014a vibrating ball without fixed dimensions. Its whole surface consisted of drops closely pressed together, and all these drops moved and changed places, sometimes several of them merging into one, sometimes one dividing into many. Each drop tried to spread out and occupy as much space as possible, but others striving to do the same compressed it, sometimes destroyed it, and sometimes merged with it.\n\n\u201cThat is life,\u201d said the old teacher.\n\n\u201cHow simple and clear it is,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cHow is it I did not know it before?\u201d\n\n\u201cGod is in the midst, and each drop tries to expand so as to reflect Him to the greatest extent. And it grows, merges, disappears from the surface, sinks to the depths, and again emerges. There now, Karat\u00e1ev has spread out and disappeared. Do you understand, my child?\u201d said the teacher.\n\n\u201cDo you understand, damn you?\u201d shouted a voice, and Pierre woke up.\n\nHe lifted himself and sat up. A Frenchman who had just pushed a Russian soldier away was squatting by the fire, engaged in roasting a piece of meat stuck on a ramrod. His sleeves were rolled up and his sinewy, hairy, red hands with their short fingers deftly turned the ramrod. His brown morose face with frowning brows was clearly visible by the glow of the charcoal.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all the same to him,\u201d he muttered, turning quickly to a soldier who stood behind him. \u201cBrigand! Get away!\u201d\n\nAnd twisting the ramrod he looked gloomily at Pierre, who turned away and gazed into the darkness. A prisoner, the Russian soldier the Frenchman had pushed away, was sitting near the fire patting something with his hand. Looking more closely Pierre recognized the blue-gray dog, sitting beside the soldier, wagging its tail.\n\n\u201cAh, he\u2019s come?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cAnd Plat\u2014\u201d he began, but did not finish.\n\nSuddenly and simultaneously a crowd of memories awoke in his fancy\u2014of the look Plat\u00f3n had given him as he sat under the tree, of the shot heard from that spot, of the dog\u2019s howl, of the guilty faces of the two Frenchmen as they ran past him, of the lowered and smoking gun, and of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s absence at this halt\u2014and he was on the point of realizing that Karat\u00e1ev had been killed, but just at that instant, he knew not why, the recollection came to his mind of a summer evening he had spent with a beautiful Polish lady on the veranda of his house in Kiev. And without linking up the events of the day or drawing a conclusion from them, Pierre closed his eyes, seeing a vision of the country in summertime mingled with memories of bathing and of the liquid, vibrating globe, and he sank into water so that it closed over his head.\n\nBefore sunrise he was awakened by shouts and loud and rapid firing. French soldiers were running past him.\n\n\u201cThe Cossacks!\u201d one of them shouted, and a moment later a crowd of Russians surrounded Pierre.\n\nFor a long time he could not understand what was happening to him. All around he heard his comrades sobbing with joy.\n\n\u201cBrothers! Dear fellows! Darlings!\u201d old soldiers exclaimed, weeping, as they embraced Cossacks and hussars.\n\nThe hussars and Cossacks crowded round the prisoners; one offered them clothes, another boots, and a third bread. Pierre sobbed as he sat among them and could not utter a word. He hugged the first soldier who approached him, and kissed him, weeping.\n\nD\u00f3lokhov stood at the gate of the ruined house, letting a crowd of disarmed Frenchmen pass by. The French, excited by all that had happened, were talking loudly among themselves, but as they passed D\u00f3lokhov who gently switched his boots with his whip and watched them with cold glassy eyes that boded no good, they became silent. On the opposite side stood D\u00f3lokhov\u2019s Cossack, counting the prisoners and marking off each hundred with a chalk line on the gate.\n\n\u201cHow many?\u201d D\u00f3lokhov asked the Cossack.\n\n\u201cThe second hundred,\u201d replied the Cossack.\n\n\u201cFilez, filez!\u201d D\u00f3lokhov kept saying, having adopted this expression from the French, and when his eyes met those of the prisoners they flashed with a cruel light.\n\nDen\u00edsov, bareheaded and with a gloomy face, walked behind some Cossacks who were carrying the body of P\u00e9tya Rost\u00f3v to a hole that had been dug in the garden.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nAfter the twenty-eighth of October when the frosts began, the flight of the French assumed a still more tragic character, with men freezing, or roasting themselves to death at the campfires, while carriages with people dressed in furs continued to drive past, carrying away the property that had been stolen by the Emperor, kings, and dukes; but the process of the flight and disintegration of the French army went on essentially as before.\n\nFrom Moscow to Vy\u00e1zma the French army of seventy-three thousand men not reckoning the Guards (who did nothing during the whole war but pillage) was reduced to thirty-six thousand, though not more than five thousand had fallen in battle. From this beginning the succeeding terms of the progression could be determined mathematically. The French army melted away and perished at the same rate from Moscow to Vy\u00e1zma, from Vy\u00e1zma to Smol\u00e9nsk, from Smol\u00e9nsk to the Ber\u00ebzina, and from the Ber\u00ebzina to V\u00edlna\u2014independently of the greater or lesser intensity of the cold, the pursuit, the barring of the way, or any other particular conditions. Beyond Vy\u00e1zma the French army instead of moving in three columns huddled together into one mass, and so went on to the end. Berthier wrote to his Emperor (we know how far commanding officers allow themselves to diverge from the truth in describing the condition of an army) and this is what he said:\n\n\nI deem it my duty to report to Your Majesty the condition of the various corps I have had occasion to observe during different stages of the last two or three days\u2019 march. They are almost disbanded. Scarcely a quarter of the soldiers remain with the standards of their regiments, the others go off by themselves in different directions hoping to find food and escape discipline. In general they regard Smol\u00e9nsk as the place where they hope to recover. During the last few days many of the men have been seen to throw away their cartridges and their arms. In such a state of affairs, whatever your ultimate plans may be, the interest of Your Majesty\u2019s service demands that the army should be rallied at Smol\u00e9nsk and should first of all be freed from ineffectives, such as dismounted cavalry, unnecessary baggage, and artillery material that is no longer in proportion to the present forces. The soldiers, who are worn out with hunger and fatigue, need these supplies as well as a few days\u2019 rest. Many have died these last days on the road or at the bivouacs. This state of things is continually becoming worse and makes one fear that unless a prompt remedy is applied the troops will no longer be under control in case of an engagement.\n\nNovember 9: twenty miles from Smol\u00e9nsk.\n\n\nAfter staggering into Smol\u00e9nsk which seemed to them a promised land, the French, searching for food, killed one another, sacked their own stores, and when everything had been plundered fled farther.\n\nThey all went without knowing whither or why they were going. Still less did that genius, Napoleon, know it, for no one issued any orders to him. But still he and those about him retained their old habits: wrote commands, letters, reports, and orders of the day; called one another sire, mon cousin, prince d\u2019Eckm\u00fchl, roi de Naples, and so on. But these orders and reports were only on paper, nothing in them was acted upon for they could not be carried out, and though they entitled one another Majesties, Highnesses, or Cousins, they all felt that they were miserable wretches who had done much evil for which they had now to pay. And though they pretended to be concerned about the army, each was thinking only of himself and of how to get away quickly and save himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nThe movements of the Russian and French armies during the campaign from Moscow back to the Niemen were like those in a game of Russian blindman\u2019s buff, in which two players are blindfolded and one of them occasionally rings a little bell to inform the catcher of his whereabouts. First he rings his bell fearlessly, but when he gets into a tight place he runs away as quietly as he can, and often thinking to escape runs straight into his opponent\u2019s arms.\n\nAt first while they were still moving along the Kal\u00faga road, Napoleon\u2019s armies made their presence known, but later when they reached the Smol\u00e9nsk road they ran holding the clapper of their bell tight\u2014and often thinking they were escaping ran right into the Russians.\n\nOwing to the rapidity of the French flight and the Russian pursuit and the consequent exhaustion of the horses, the chief means of approximately ascertaining the enemy\u2019s position\u2014by cavalry scouting\u2014was not available. Besides, as a result of the frequent and rapid change of position by each army, even what information was obtained could not be delivered in time. If news was received one day that the enemy had been in a certain position the day before, by the third day when something could have been done, that army was already two days\u2019 march farther on and in quite another position.\n\nOne army fled and the other pursued. Beyond Smol\u00e9nsk there were several different", "sequence": 27}, {"offset": 2800000, "text": " roads available for the French, and one would have thought that during their stay of four days they might have learned where the enemy was, might have arranged some more advantageous plan and undertaken something new. But after a four days\u2019 halt the mob, with no maneuvers or plans, again began running along the beaten track, neither to the right nor to the left but along the old\u2014the worst\u2014road, through Kr\u00e1snoe and Orsh\u00e1.\n\nExpecting the enemy from behind and not in front, the French separated in their flight and spread out over a distance of twenty-four hours. In front of them all fled the Emperor, then the kings, then the dukes. The Russian army, expecting Napoleon to take the road to the right beyond the Dnieper\u2014which was the only reasonable thing for him to do\u2014themselves turned to the right and came out onto the highroad at Kr\u00e1snoe. And here as in a game of blindman\u2019s buff the French ran into our vanguard. Seeing their enemy unexpectedly the French fell into confusion and stopped short from the sudden fright, but then they resumed their flight, abandoning their comrades who were farther behind. Then for three days separate portions of the French army\u2014first Murat\u2019s (the vice-king\u2019s), then Davout\u2019s, and then Ney\u2019s\u2014ran, as it were, the gauntlet of the Russian army. They abandoned one another, abandoned all their heavy baggage, their artillery, and half their men, and fled, getting past the Russians by night by making semicircles to the right.\n\nNey, who came last, had been busying himself blowing up the walls of Smol\u00e9nsk which were in nobody\u2019s way, because despite the unfortunate plight of the French or because of it, they wished to punish the floor against which they had hurt themselves. Ney, who had had a corps of ten thousand men, reached Napoleon at Orsh\u00e1 with only one thousand men left, having abandoned all the rest and all his cannon, and having crossed the Dnieper at night by stealth at a wooded spot.\n\nFrom Orsh\u00e1 they fled farther along the road to V\u00edlna, still playing at blindman\u2019s buff with the pursuing army. At the Ber\u00ebzina they again became disorganized, many were drowned and many surrendered, but those who got across the river fled farther. Their supreme chief donned a fur coat and, having seated himself in a sleigh, galloped on alone, abandoning his companions. The others who could do so drove away too, leaving those who could not to surrender or die.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\n\nThis campaign consisted in a flight of the French during which they did all they could to destroy themselves. From the time they turned onto the Kal\u00faga road to the day their leader fled from the army, none of the movements of the crowd had any sense. So one might have thought that regarding this period of the campaign the historians, who attributed the actions of the mass to the will of one man, would have found it impossible to make the story of the retreat fit their theory. But no! Mountains of books have been written by the historians about this campaign, and everywhere are described Napoleon\u2019s arrangements, the maneuvers, and his profound plans which guided the army, as well as the military genius shown by his marshals.\n\nThe retreat from M\u00e1lo-Yarosl\u00e1vets when he had a free road into a well-supplied district and the parallel road was open to him along which Kut\u00fazov afterwards pursued him\u2014this unnecessary retreat along a devastated road\u2014is explained to us as being due to profound considerations. Similarly profound considerations are given for his retreat from Smol\u00e9nsk to Orsh\u00e1. Then his heroism at Kr\u00e1snoe is described, where he is reported to have been prepared to accept battle and take personal command, and to have walked about with a birch stick and said:\n\n\u201cJ\u2019ai assez fait l\u2019empereur; il est temps de faire le g\u00e9n\u00e9ral,\u201d but nevertheless immediately ran away again, abandoning to its fate the scattered fragments of the army he left behind.\n\nThen we are told of the greatness of soul of the marshals, especially of Ney\u2014a greatness of soul consisting in this: that he made his way by night around through the forest and across the Dnieper and escaped to Orsh\u00e1, abandoning standards, artillery, and nine tenths of his men.\n\nAnd lastly, the final departure of the great Emperor from his heroic army is presented to us by the historians as something great and characteristic of genius. Even that final running away, described in ordinary language as the lowest depth of baseness which every child is taught to be ashamed of\u2014even that act finds justification in the historians\u2019 language.\n\nWhen it is impossible to stretch the very elastic threads of historical ratiocination any farther, when actions are clearly contrary to all that humanity calls right or even just, the historians produce a saving conception of \u201cgreatness.\u201d \u201cGreatness,\u201d it seems, excludes the standards of right and wrong. For the \u201cgreat\u201d man nothing is wrong, there is no atrocity for which a \u201cgreat\u201d man can be blamed.\n\n\u201cC\u2019est grand!\u201d say the historians, and there no longer exists either good or evil but only \u201cgrand\u201d and \u201cnot grand.\u201d Grand is good, not grand is bad. Grand is the characteristic, in their conception, of some special animals called \u201cheroes.\u201d And Napoleon, escaping home in a warm fur coat and leaving to perish those who were not merely his comrades but were (in his opinion) men he had brought there, feels que c\u2019est grand, and his soul is tranquil.\n\n\u201cDu sublime (he saw something sublime in himself) au ridicule il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un pas,\u201d said he. And the whole world for fifty years has been repeating: \u201cSublime! Grand! Napol\u00e9on le Grand!\u201d Du sublime au ridicule il n\u2019y a qu\u2019un pas.\n\nAnd it occurs to no one that to admit a greatness not commensurable with the standard of right and wrong is merely to admit one\u2019s own nothingness and immeasurable meanness.\n\nFor us with the standard of good and evil given us by Christ, no human actions are incommensurable. And there is no greatness where simplicity, goodness, and truth are absent.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nWhat Russian, reading the account of the last part of the campaign of 1812, has not experienced an uncomfortable feeling of regret, dissatisfaction, and perplexity? Who has not asked himself how it is that the French were not all captured or destroyed when our three armies surrounded them in superior numbers, when the disordered French, hungry and freezing, surrendered in crowds, and when (as the historians relate) the aim of the Russians was to stop the French, to cut them off, and capture them all?\n\nHow was it that the Russian army, which when numerically weaker than the French had given battle at Borodin\u00f3, did not achieve its purpose when it had surrounded the French on three sides and when its aim was to capture them? Can the French be so enormously superior to us that when we had surrounded them with superior forces we could not beat them? How could that happen?\n\nHistory (or what is called by that name) replying to these questions says that this occurred because Kut\u00fazov and Torm\u00e1sov and Chichag\u00f3v, and this man and that man, did not execute such and such maneuvers....\n\nBut why did they not execute those maneuvers? And why if they were guilty of not carrying out a prearranged plan were they not tried and punished? But even if we admitted that Kut\u00fazov, Chichag\u00f3v, and others were the cause of the Russian failures, it is still incomprehensible why, the position of the Russian army being what it was at Kr\u00e1snoe and at the Ber\u00ebzina (in both cases we had superior forces), the French army with its marshals, kings, and Emperor was not captured, if that was what the Russians aimed at.\n\nThe explanation of this strange fact given by Russian military historians (to the effect that Kut\u00fazov hindered an attack) is unfounded, for we know that he could not restrain the troops from attacking at Vy\u00e1zma and Tar\u00fatino.\n\nWhy was the Russian army\u2014which with inferior forces had withstood the enemy in full strength at Borodin\u00f3\u2014defeated at Kr\u00e1snoe and the Ber\u00ebzina by the disorganized crowds of the French when it was numerically superior?\n\nIf the aim of the Russians consisted in cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his marshals\u2014and that aim was not merely frustrated but all attempts to attain it were most shamefully baffled\u2014then this last period of the campaign is quite rightly considered by the French to be a series of victories, and quite wrongly considered victorious by Russian historians.\n\nThe Russian military historians in so far as they submit to claims of logic must admit that conclusion, and in spite of their lyrical rhapsodies about valor, devotion, and so forth, must reluctantly admit that the French retreat from Moscow was a series of victories for Napoleon and defeats for Kut\u00fazov.\n\nBut putting national vanity entirely aside one feels that such a conclusion involves a contradiction, since the series of French victories brought the French complete destruction, while the series of Russian defeats led to the total destruction of their enemy and the liberation of their country.\n\nThe source of this contradiction lies in the fact that the historians studying the events from the letters of the sovereigns and the generals, from memoirs, reports, projects, and so forth, have attributed to this last period of the war of 1812 an aim that never existed, namely that of cutting off and capturing Napoleon with his marshals and his army.\n\nThere never was or could have been such an aim, for it would have been senseless and its attainment quite impossible.\n\nIt would have been senseless, first because Napoleon\u2019s disorganized army was flying from Russia with all possible speed, that is to say, was doing just what every Russian desired. So what was the use of performing various operations on the French who were running away as fast as they possibly could?\n\nSecondly, it would have been senseless to block the passage of men whose whole energy was directed to flight.\n\nThirdly, it would have been senseless to sacrifice one\u2019s own troops in order to destroy the French army, which without external interference was destroying itself at such a rate that, though its path was not blocked, it could not carry across the frontier more than it actually did in December, namely a hundredth part of the original army.\n\nFourthly, it would have been senseless to wish to take captive the Emperor, kings, and dukes\u2014whose capture would have been in the highest degree embarrassing for the Russians, as the most adroit diplomatists of the time (Joseph de Maistre and others) recognized. Still more senseless would have been the wish to capture army corps of the French, when our own army had melted away to half before reaching Kr\u00e1snoe and a whole division would have been needed to convoy the corps of prisoners, and when our men were not always getting full rations and the prisoners already taken were perishing of hunger.\n\nAll the profound plans about cutting off and capturing Napoleon and his army were like the plan of a market gardener who, when driving out of his garden a cow that had trampled down the beds he had planted, should run to the gate and hit the cow on the head. The only thing to be said in excuse of that gardener would be that he was very angry. But not even that could be said for those who drew up this project, for it was not they who had suffered from the trampled beds.\n\nBut besides the fact that cutting off Napoleon with his army would have been senseless, it was impossible.\n\nIt was impossible first because\u2014as experience shows that a three-mile movement of columns on a battlefield never coincides with the plans\u2014the probability of Chichag\u00f3v, Kut\u00fazov, and Wittgenstein effecting a junction on time at an appointed place was so remote as to be tantamount to impossibility, as in fact thought Kut\u00fazov, who when he received the plan remarked that diversions planned over great distances do not yield the desired results.\n\nSecondly it was impossible, because to paralyze the momentum with which Napoleon\u2019s army was retiring, incomparably greater forces than the Russians possessed would have been required.\n\nThirdly it was impossible, because the military term \u201cto cut off\u201d has no meaning. One can cut off a slice of bread, but not an army. To cut off an army\u2014to bar its road\u2014is quite impossible, for there is always plenty of room to avoid capture and there is the night when nothing can be seen, as the military scientists might convince themselves by the example of Kr\u00e1snoe and of the Ber\u00ebzina. It is only possible to capture prisoners if they agree to be captured, just as it is only possible to catch a swallow if it settles on one\u2019s hand. Men can only be taken prisoners if they surrender according to the rules of strategy and tactics, as the Germans did. But the French troops quite rightly did not consider that this suited them, since death by hunger and cold awaited them in flight or captivity alike.\n\nFourthly and chiefly it was impossible, because never since the world began has a war been fought under such conditions as those that obtained in 1812, and the Russian army in its pursuit of the French strained its strength to the utmost and could not have done more without destroying itself.\n\nDuring the movement of the Russian army from Tar\u00fatino to Kr\u00e1snoe it lost fifty thousand sick or stragglers, that is a number equal to the population of a large provincial town. Half the men fell out of the army without a battle.\n\nAnd it is of this period of the campaign\u2014when the army lacked boots and sheepskin coats, was short of provisions and without vodka, and was camping out at night for months in the snow with fifteen degrees of frost, when there were only seven or eight hours of daylight and the rest was night in which the influence of discipline cannot be maintained, when men were taken into that region of death where discipline fails, not for a few hours only as in a battle, but for months, where they were every moment fighting death from hunger and cold, when half the army perished in a single month\u2014it is of this period of the campaign that the historians tell us how Milor\u00e1dovich should have made a flank march to such and such a place, Torm\u00e1sov to another place, and Chichag\u00f3v should have crossed (more than knee-deep in snow) to somewhere else, and how so-and-so \u201crouted\u201d and \u201ccut off\u201d the French and so on and so on.\n\nThe Russians, half of whom died, did all that could and should have been done to attain an end worthy of the nation, and they are not to blame because other Russians, sitting in warm rooms, proposed that they should do what was impossible.\n\nAll that strange contradiction now difficult to understand between the facts and the historical accounts only arises because the historians dealing with the matter have written the history of the beautiful words and sentiments of various generals, and not the history of the events.\n\nTo them the words of Milor\u00e1dovich seem very interesting, and so do their surmises and the rewards this or that general received; but the question of those fifty thousand men who were left in hospitals and in graves does not even interest them, for it does not come within the range of their investigation.\n\nYet one need only discard the study of the reports and general plans and consider the movement of those hundreds of thousands of men who took a direct part in the events, and all the questions that seemed insoluble easily and simply receive an immediate and certain solution.\n\nThe aim of cutting off Napoleon and his army never existed except in the imaginations of a dozen people. It could not exist because it was senseless and unattainable.\n\nThe people had a single aim: to free their land from invasion. That aim was attained in the first place of itself, as the French ran away, and so it was only necessary not to stop their flight. Secondly it was attained by the guerrilla warfare which was destroying the French, and thirdly by the fact that a large Russian army was following the French, ready to use its strength in case their movement stopped.\n\nThe Russian army had to act like a whip to a running animal. And the experienced driver knew it was better to hold the whip raised as a menace than to strike the running animal on the head.\n\n\n\nBOOK FIFTEEN: 1812 - 13\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nWhen seeing a dying animal a man feels a sense of horror: substance similar to his own is perishing before his eyes. But when it is a beloved and intimate human being that is dying, besides this horror at the extinction of life there is a severance, a spiritual wound, which like a physical wound is sometimes fatal and sometimes heals, but always aches and shrinks at any external irritating touch.\n\nAfter Prince Andrew\u2019s death Nat\u00e1sha and Princess Mary alike felt this. Drooping in spirit and closing their eyes before the menacing cloud of death that overhung them, they dared not look life in the face. They carefully guarded their open wounds from any rough and painful contact. Everything: a carriage passing rapidly in the street, a summons to dinner, the maid\u2019s inquiry what dress to prepare, or worse still any word of insincere or feeble sympathy, seemed an insult, painfully irritated the wound, interrupting that necessary quiet in which they both tried to listen to the stern and dreadful choir that still resounded in their imagination, and hindered their gazing into those mysterious limitless vistas that for an instant had opened out before them.\n\nOnly when alone together were they free from such outrage and pain. They spoke little even to one another, and when they did it was of very unimportant matters.\n\nBoth avoided any allusion to the future. To admit the possibility of a future seemed to them to insult his memory. Still more carefully did they avoid anything relating to him who was dead. It seemed to them that what they had lived through and experienced could not be expressed in words, and that any reference to the details of his life infringed the majesty and sacredness of the mystery that had been accomplished before their eyes.\n\nContinued abstention from speech, and constant avoidance of everything that might lead up to the subject\u2014this halting on all sides at the boundary of what they might not mention\u2014brought before their minds with still greater purity and clearness what they were both feeling.\n\nBut pure and complete sorrow is as impossible as pure and complete joy. Princess Mary, in her position as absolute and independent arbiter of her own fate and guardian and instructor of her nephew, was the first to be called back to life from that realm of sorrow in which she had dwelt for the first fortnight. She received letters from her relations to which she had to reply; the room in which little Nicholas had been put was damp and he began to cough; Alp\u00e1tych came to Yarosl\u00e1vl with reports on the state of their affairs and with advice and suggestions that they should return to Moscow to the house on the Vozdv\u00edzhenka Street, which had remained uninjured and needed only slight repairs. Life did not stand still and it was necessary to live. Hard as it was for Princess Mary to emerge from the realm of secluded contemplation in which she had lived till then, and sorry and almost ashamed as she felt to leave Nat\u00e1sha alone, yet the cares of life demanded her attention and she involuntarily yielded to them. She went through the accounts with Alp\u00e1tych, conferred with Dessalles about her nephew, and gave orders and made preparations for the journey to Moscow.\n\nNat\u00e1sha remained alone and, from the time Princess Mary began making preparations for departure, held aloof from her too.\n\nPrincess Mary asked the countess to let Nat\u00e1sha go with her to Moscow, and both parents gladly accepted this offer, for they saw their daughter losing strength every day and thought that a change of scene and the advice of Moscow doctors would be good for her.\n\n\u201cI am not going anywhere,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha replied when this was proposed to her. \u201cDo please just leave me alone!\u201d And she ran out of the room, with difficulty refraining from tears of vexation and irritation rather than of sorrow.\n\nAfter she felt herself deserted by Princes Mary and alone in her grief, Nat\u00e1sha spent most of the time in her room by herself, sitting huddled up feet and all in the corner of the sofa, tearing and twisting something with her slender nervous fingers and gazing intently and fixedly at whatever her eyes chanced to fall on. This solitude exhausted and tormented her but she was in absolute need of it. As soon as anyone entered she got up quickly, changed her position and expression, and picked up a book or some sewing, evidently waiting impatiently for the intruder to go.\n\nShe felt all the time as if she might at any moment penetrate that on which\u2014with a terrible questioning too great for her strength\u2014her spiritual gaze was fixed.\n\nOne day toward the end of December Nat\u00e1sha, pale and thin, dressed in a black woolen gown, her plaited hair negligently twisted into a knot, was crouched feet and all in the corner of her sofa, nervously crumpling and smoothing out the end of her sash while she looked at a corner of the door.\n\nShe was gazing in the direction in which he had gone\u2014to the other side of life. And that other side of life, of which she had never before thought and which had formerly seemed to her so far away and improbable, was now nearer and more akin and more comprehensible than this side of life, where everything was either emptiness and desolation or suffering and indignity.\n\nShe was gazing where she knew him to be; but she could not imagine him otherwise than as he had been here. She now saw him again as he had been at Myt\u00edshchi, at Tr\u00f3itsa, and at Yarosl\u00e1vl.\n\nShe saw his face, heard his voice, repeated his words and her own, and sometimes devised other words they might have spoken.\n\nThere he is lying back in an armchair in his velvet cloak, leaning his head on his thin pale hand. His chest is dreadfully hollow and his shoulders raised. His lips are firmly closed, his eyes glitter, and a wrinkle comes and goes on his pale forehead. One of his legs twitches just perceptibly, but rapidly. Nat\u00e1sha knows that he is struggling with terrible pain. \u201cWhat is that pain like? Why does he have that pain? What does he feel? How does it hurt him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. He noticed her watching him, raised his eyes, and began to speak seriously:\n\n\u201cOne thing would be terrible,\u201d said he: \u201cto bind oneself forever to a suffering man. It would be continual torture.\u201d And he looked searchingly at her. Nat\u00e1sha as usual answered before she had time to think what she would say. She said: \u201cThis can\u2019t go on\u2014it won\u2019t. You will get well\u2014quite well.\u201d\n\nShe now saw him from the commencement of that scene and relived what she had then felt. She recalled his long sad and severe look at those words and understood the meaning of the rebuke and despair in that protracted gaze.\n\n\u201cI agreed,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha now said to herself, \u201cthat it would be dreadful if he always continued to suffer. I said it then only because it would have been dreadful for him, but he understood it differently. He thought it would be dreadful for me. He then still wished to live and feared death. And I said it so awkwardly and stupidly! I did not say what I meant. I thought quite differently. Had I said what I thought, I should have said: even if he had to go on dying, to die continually before my eyes, I should have been happy compared with what I am now. Now there is nothing... nobody. Did he know that? No, he did not and never will know it. And now it will never, never be possible to put it right.\u201d And now he again seemed to be saying the same words to her, only in her imagination Nat\u00e1sha this time gave him a different answer. She stopped him and said: \u201cTerrible for you, but not for me! You know that for me there is nothing in life but you, and to suffer with you is the greatest happiness for me,\u201d and he took her hand and pressed it as he had pressed it that terrible evening four days before his death. And in her imagination she said other tender and loving words which she might have said then but only spoke now: \u201cI love thee!... thee! I love, love...\u201d she said, convulsively pressing her hands and setting her teeth with a desperate effort....\n\nShe was overcome by sweet sorrow and tears were already rising in her eyes; then she suddenly asked herself to whom she was saying this. Again everything was shrouded in hard, dry perplexity, and again with a strained frown she peered toward the world where he was. And now, now it seemed to her she was penetrating the mystery.... But at the instant when it seemed that the incomprehensible was revealing itself to her a loud rattle of the door handle struck painfully on her ears. Duny\u00e1sha, her maid, entered the room quickly and abruptly with a frightened look on her face and showing no concern for her mistress.\n\n\u201cCome to your Papa at once, please!\u201d said she with a strange, excited look. \u201cA misfortune... about Peter Il\u00fdnich... a letter,\u201d she finished with a sob.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nBesides a feeling of aloofness from everybody Nat\u00e1sha was feeling a special estrangement from the members of her own family. All of them\u2014her father, mother, and S\u00f3nya\u2014were so near to her, so familiar, so commonplace, that all their words and feelings seemed an insult to the world in which she had been living of late, and she felt not merely indifferent to them but regarded them with hostility. She heard Duny\u00e1sha\u2019s words about Peter Il\u00fdnich and a misfortune, but did not grasp them.\n\n\u201cWhat misfortune? What misfortune can happen to them? They just live their own old, quiet, and commonplace life,\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nAs she entered the ballroom her father was hurriedly coming out of her mother\u2019s room. His face was puckered up and wet with tears. He had evidently run out of that room to give vent to the sobs that were choking him. When he saw Nat\u00e1sha he waved his arms despairingly and burst into convulsively painful sobs that distorted his soft round face.\n\n\u201cPe... P\u00e9tya... Go, go, she... is calling...\u201d and weeping like a child and quickly shuffling on his feeble legs to a chair, he almost fell into it, covering his face with his hands.\n\nSuddenly an electric shock seemed to run through Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s whole being. Terrible anguish struck her heart, she felt a dreadful ache as if something was being torn inside her and she were dying. But the pain was immediately followed by a feeling of release from the oppressive constraint that had prevented her taking part in life. The sight of her father, the terribly wild cries of her mother that she heard through the door, made her immediately forget herself and her own grief.\n\nShe ran to her father, but he feebly waved his arm, pointing to her mother\u2019s door. Princess Mary, pale and with quivering chin, came out from that room and taking Nat\u00e1sha by the arm said something to her. Nat\u00e1sha neither saw nor heard her. She went in with rapid steps, pausing at the door for an instant as if struggling with herself, and then ran to her mother.\n\nThe countess was lying in an armchair in a strange and awkward position, stretching out and beating her head against the wall. S\u00f3nya and the maids were holding her arms.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha! Nat\u00e1sha!...\u201d cried the countess. \u201cIt\u2019s not true... it\u2019s not true... He\u2019s lying... Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d she shrieked, pushing those around her away. \u201cGo away, all of you; it\u2019s not true! Killed!... ha, ha, ha!... It\u2019s not true!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha put one knee on the armchair, stooped over her mother, embraced her, and with unexpected strength raised her, turned her face toward herself, and clung to her.\n\n\u201cMummy!... darling!... I am here, my dearest Mummy,\u201d she kept on whispering, not pausing an instant.\n\nShe did not let go of her mother but struggled tenderly with her, demanded a pillow and hot water, and unfastened and tore open her mother\u2019s dress.\n\n\u201cMy dearest darling... Mummy, my precious!...\u201d she whispered incessantly, kissing her head, her hands, her face, and feeling her own irrepressible and streaming tears tickling her nose and cheeks.\n\nThe countess pressed her daughter\u2019s hand, closed her eyes, and became quiet for a moment. Suddenly she sat up with unaccustomed swiftness, glanced vacantly around her, and seeing Nat\u00e1sha began to press her daughter\u2019s head with all her strength. Then she turned toward her daughter\u2019s face which was wincing with pain and gazed long at it.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, you love me?\u201d she said in a soft trustful whisper. \u201cNat\u00e1sha, you would not deceive me? You\u2019ll tell me the whole truth?\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at her with eyes full of tears and in her look there was nothing but love and an entreaty for forgiveness.\n\n\u201cMy darling Mummy!\u201d she repeated, straining all the power of her love to find some way of taking on herself the excess of grief that crushed her mother.\n\nAnd again in a futile struggle with reality her mother, refusing to believe that she could live when her beloved boy was killed in the bloom of life, escaped from reality into a world of delirium.\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not remember how that day passed nor that night, nor the next day and night. She did not sleep and did not leave her mother. Her persevering and patient love seemed completely to surround the countess every moment, not explaining or consoling, but recalling her to life.\n\nDuring the third night the countess kept very quiet for a few minutes, and Nat\u00e1sha rested her head on the arm of her chair and closed her eyes, but opened them again on hearing the bedstead creak. The countess was sitting up in bed and speaking softly.\n\n\u201cHow glad I am you have come. You are tired. Won\u2019t you have some tea?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha went up to her. \u201cYou have improved in looks and grown more manly,\u201d continued the countess, taking her daughter\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cMamma! What are you saying...\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, he is no more, no more!\u201d\n\nAnd embracing her daughter, the countess began to weep for the first time.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nPrincess Mary postponed her departure. S\u00f3nya and the count tried to replace Nat\u00e1sha but could not. They saw that she alone was able to restrain her mother from unreasoning despair. For three weeks Nat\u00e1sha remained constantly at her mother\u2019s side, sleeping on a lounge chair in her room, making her eat and drink, and talking to her incessantly because the mere sound of her tender, caressing tones soothed her mother.\n\nThe mother\u2019s wounded spirit could not heal. P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had torn from her half her life. When the news of P\u00e9tya\u2019s death had come she had been a fresh and vigorous woman of fifty, but a month later she left her room a listless old woman taking no interest in life. But the same blow that almost killed the countess, this second blow, restored Nat\u00e1sha to life.\n\nA spiritual wound produced by a rending of the spiritual body is like a physical wound and, strange as it may seem, just as a deep wound may heal and its edges join, physical and spiritual wounds alike can yet heal completely only as the result of a vital force from within.\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s wound healed in that way. She thought her life was ended, but her love for her mother unexpectedly showed her that the essence of life\u2014love\u2014was still active within her. Love awoke and so did life.\n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s last days had bound Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha together; this new sorrow brought them still closer to one another. Princess Mary put off her departure, and for three weeks looked after Nat\u00e1sha as if she had been a sick child. The last weeks passed in her mother\u2019s bedroom had strained Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s physical strength.\n\nOne afternoon noticing Nat\u00e1sha shivering with fever, Princess Mary took her to her own room and made her lie down on the bed. Nat\u00e1sha lay down, but when Princess Mary had drawn the blinds and was going away she called her back.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep, Mary, sit by me a little.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are tired\u2014try to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, no. Why did you bring me away? She will be asking for me.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe is much better. She spoke so well today,\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nNat\u00e1sha lay on the bed and in the semidarkness of the room scanned Princess Mary\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cIs she like him?\u201d thought Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYes, like and yet not like. But she is quite original, strange, new, and unknown. And she loves me. What is in her heart? All that is good. But how? What is her mind like? What does she think about me? Yes, she is splendid!\u201d\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d she said timidly, drawing Princess Mary\u2019s hand to herself, \u201cMary, you mustn\u2019t think me wicked. No? Mary darling, how I love you! Let us be quite, quite friends.\u201d\n\nAnd Nat\u00e1sha, embracing her, began kissing her face and hands, making Princess Mary feel shy but happy by this demonstration of her feelings.\n\nFrom that day a tender and passionate friendship such as exists only between women was established between Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha. They were continually kissing and saying tender things to one another and spent most of their time together. When one went out the other became restless and hastened to rejoin her. Together they felt more in harmony with one another than either of them felt with herself when alone. A feeling stronger than friendship sprang up between them; an exclusive feeling of life being possible only in each other\u2019s presence.\n\nSometimes they were silent for hours; sometimes after they were already in bed they would begin talking and go on till morning. They spoke most of what was long past. Princess Mary spoke of her childhood, of her mother, her father, and her daydreams; and Nat\u00e1sha, who with a passive lack of understanding had formerly turned away from that life of devotion, submission, and the poetry of Christian self-sacrifice, now feeling herself bound to Princess Mary by affection, learned to love her past too and to understand a side of life previously incomprehensible to her. She did not think of applying submission and self-abnegation to her own life, for she was accustomed to seek other joys, but she understood and loved in another those previously incomprehensible virtues. For Princess Mary, listening to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s tales of childhood and early youth, there also opened out a new and hitherto uncomprehended side of life: belief in life and its enjoyment.\n\nJust as before, they never mentioned him so as not to lower (as they thought) their exalted feelings by words; but this silence about him had the effect of making them gradually begin to forget him without being conscious of it.\n\nNat\u00e1sha had grown thin and pale and physically so weak that they all talked about her health, and this pleased her. But sometimes she was suddenly overcome by fear not only of death but of sickness, weakness, and loss of good looks, and involuntarily she examined her bare arm carefully, surprised at its thinness, and in the morning noticed her drawn and, as it seemed to her, piteous face in her glass. It seemed to her that things must be so, and yet it was dreadfully sad.\n\nOne day she went quickly upstairs and found herself out of breath. Unconsciously she immediately invented a reason for going down, and then, testing her strength, ran upstairs again, observing the result.\n\nAnother time when she called Duny\u00e1sha her voice trembled, so she called again\u2014though she could hear Duny\u00e1sha coming\u2014called her in the deep chest tones in which she had been wont to sing, and listened attentively to herself.\n\nShe did not know and would not have believed it, but beneath the layer of slime that covered her soul and seemed to her impenetrable, delicate young shoots of grass were already sprouting, which taking root would so cover with their living verdure the grief that weighed her down that it would soon no longer be seen or noticed. The wound had begun to heal from within.\n\nAt the end of January Princess Mary left for Moscow, and the count insisted on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s going with her to consult the doctors.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nAfter the encounter at Vy\u00e1zma, where Kut\u00fazov had been unable to hold back his troops in their anxiety to overwhelm and cut off the enemy and so on, the farther movement of the fleeing French, and of the Russians who pursued them, continued as far as Kr\u00e1snoe without a battle. The flight was so rapid that the Russian army pursuing the French could not keep up with them; cavalry and artillery horses broke down, and the information received of the movements of the French was never reliable.\n\nThe men in the Russian army were so worn out by this continuous marching at the rate of twenty-seven miles a day that they could not go any faster.\n\nTo realize the degree of exhaustion of the Russian army it is only necessary to grasp clearly the meaning of the fact that, while not losing more than five thousand killed and wounded after Tar\u00fatino and less than a hundred prisoners, the Russian army which left that place a hundred thousand strong reached Kr\u00e1snoe with only fifty thousand.\n\nThe rapidity of the Russian pursuit was just as destructive to our army as the flight of the French was to theirs. The only difference was that the Russian army moved voluntarily, with no such threat of destruction as hung over the French, and that the sick Frenchmen were left behind in enemy hands while the sick Russians left behind were among their own people. The chief cause of the wastage of Napoleon\u2019s army was the rapidity of its movement, and a convincing proof of this is the corresponding decrease of the Russian army.\n\nKut\u00fazov as far as was in his power, instead of trying to check the movement of the French as was desired in Petersburg and by the Russian army generals, directed his whole activity here, as he had done at Tar\u00fatino and Vy\u00e1zma, to hastening it on while easing the movement of our army.\n\nBut besides this, since the exhaustion and enormous diminution of the army caused by the rapidity of the advance had become evident, another reason for slackening the pace and delaying presented itself to Kut\u00fazov. The aim of the Russian army was to pursue the French. The road the French would take was unknown, and so the closer our troops trod on their heels the greater distance they had to cover. Only by following at some distance could one cut across the zigzag path of the French. All the artful maneuvers suggested by our generals meant fresh movements of the army and a lengthening of its marches, whereas the only reasonable aim was to shorten those marches. To that end Kut\u00fazov\u2019s activity was directed during the whole campaign from Moscow to V\u00edlna\u2014not casually or intermittently but so consistently that he never once deviated from it.\n\nKut\u00fazov felt and knew\u2014not by reasoning or science but with the whole of his Russian being\u2014what every Russian soldier felt: that the French were beaten, that the enemy was flying and must be driven out; but at the same time he like the soldiers realized all the hardship of this march, the rapidity of which was unparalleled for such a time of the year.\n\nBut to the generals, especially the foreign ones in the Russian army, who wished to distinguish themselves, to astonish somebody, and for some reason to capture a king or a duke\u2014it seemed that now\u2014when any battle must be horrible and senseless\u2014was the very time to fight and conquer somebody. Kut\u00fazov merely shrugged his shoulders when one after another they presented projects of maneuvers to be made with those soldiers\u2014ill-shod, insufficiently clad, and half starved\u2014who within a month and without fighting a battle had dwindled to half their number, and who at the best if the flight continued would have to go a greater distance than they had already traversed, before they reached the frontier.\n\nThis longing to distinguish themselves, to maneuver, to overthrow, and to cut off showed itself particularly whenever the Russians stumbled on the French army.\n\nSo it was at Kr\u00e1snoe, where they expected to find one of the three French columns and stumbled instead on Napoleon himself with sixteen thousand men. Despite all Kut\u00fazov\u2019s efforts to avoid that ruinous encounter and to preserve his troops, the massacre of the broken mob of French soldiers by worn-out Russians continued at Kr\u00e1snoe for three days.\n\nToll wrote a disposition: \u201cThe first column will march to so and so,\u201d etc. And as usual nothing happened in accord with the disposition. Prince Eug\u00e8ne of W\u00fcrttemberg fired from a hill over the French crowds that were running past, and demanded reinforcements which did not arrive. The French, avoiding the Russians, dispersed and hid themselves in the forest by night, making their way round as best they could, and continued their flight.\n\nMilor\u00e1dovich, who said he did not want to know anything about the commissariat affairs of his detachment, and could never be found when he was wanted\u2014that chevalier sans peur et sans reproche as he styled himself\u2014who was fond of parleys with the French, sent envoys demanding their surrender, wasted time, and did not do what he was ordered to do.\n\n\u201cI give you that column, lads,\u201d he said, riding up to the troops and pointing out the French to the cavalry.\n\nAnd the cavalry, with spurs and sabers urging on horses that could scarcely move, trotted with much effort to the column presented to them\u2014that is to say, to a crowd of Frenchmen stark with cold, frost-bitten, and starving\u2014and the column that had been presented to them threw down its arms and surrendered as it had long been anxious to do.\n\nAt Kr\u00e1snoe they took twenty-six thousand prisoners, several hundred cannon, and a stick called a \u201cmarshal\u2019s staff,\u201d and disputed as to who had distinguished himself and were pleased with their achievement\u2014though they much regretted not having taken Napoleon, or at least a marshal or a hero of some sort, and reproached one another and especially Kut\u00fazov for having failed to do so.\n\nThese men, carried away by their passions, were but blind tools of the most melancholy law of necessity, but considered themselves heroes and imagined that they were accomplishing a most noble and honorable deed. They blamed Kut\u00fazov and said that from the very beginning of the campaign he had prevented their vanquishing Napoleon, that he thought of nothing but satisfying his passions and would not advance from the Linen Factories because he was comfortable there, that at Kr\u00e1snoe he checked the advance because on learning that Napoleon was there he had quite lost his head, and that it was probable that he had an understanding with Napoleon and had been bribed by him, and so on, and so on.\n\nNot only did his contemporaries, carried away by their passions, talk in this way, but posterity and history have acclaimed Napoleon as grand, while Kut\u00fazov is described by foreigners as a crafty, dissolute, weak old courtier, and by Russians as something indefinite\u2014a sort of puppet useful only because he had a Russian name.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nIn 1812 and 1813 Kut\u00fazov was openly accused of blundering. The Emperor was dissatisfied with him. And in a history recently written by order of the Highest Authorities it is said that Kut\u00fazov was a cunning court liar, frightened of the name of Napoleon, and that by his blunders at Kr\u00e1snoe and the Ber\u00ebzina he deprived the Russian army of the glory of complete victory over the French.\n\nSuch is the fate not of great men (grands hommes) whom the Russian mind does not acknowledge, but of those rare and always solitary individuals who, discerning the will of Providence, submit their personal will to it. The hatred and contempt of the crowd punish such men for discerning the higher laws.\n\nFor Russian historians, strange and terrible to say, Napoleon\u2014that most insignificant tool of history who never anywhere, even in exile, showed human dignity\u2014Napoleon is the object of adulation and enthusiasm; he is grand. But Kut\u00fazov\u2014the man who from the beginning to the end of his activity in 1812, never once swerving by word or deed from Borodin\u00f3 to V\u00edlna, presented an example exceptional in history of self-sacrifice and a present consciousness of the future importance of what was happening\u2014Kut\u00fazov seems to them something indefinite and pitiful, and when speaking of him and of the year 1812 they always seem a little ashamed.\n\nAnd yet it is difficult to imagine an historical character whose activity was so unswervingly directed to a single aim; and it would be difficult to imagine any aim more worthy or more consonant with the will of the whole people. Still more difficult would it be to find an instance in history of the aim of an historical personage being so completely accomplished as that to which all Kut\u00fazov\u2019s efforts were directed in 1812.\n\nKut\u00fazov never talked of \u201cforty centuries looking down from the Pyramids,\u201d of the sacrifices he offered for the fatherland, or of what he intended to accomplish or had accomplished; in general he said nothing about himself, adopted no pose, always appeared to be the simplest and most ordinary of men, and said the simplest and most ordinary things. He wrote letters to his daughters and to Madame de Sta\u00ebl, read novels, liked the society of pretty women, jested with generals, officers, and soldiers, and never contradicted those who tried to prove anything to him. When Count Rostopch\u00edn at the Ya\u00faza bridge galloped up to Kut\u00fazov with personal reproaches for having caused the destruction of Moscow, and said: \u201cHow was it you promised not to abandon Moscow without a battle?\u201d Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cAnd I shall not abandon Moscow without a battle,\u201d though Moscow was then already abandoned. When Arakch\u00e9ev, coming to him from the Emperor, said that Erm\u00f3lov ought to be appointed chief of the artillery, Kut\u00fazov replied: \u201cYes, I was just saying so myself,\u201d though a moment before he had said quite the contrary. What did it matter to him\u2014who then alone amid a senseless crowd understood the whole tremendous significance of what was happening\u2014what did it matter to him whether Rostopch\u00edn attributed the calamities of Moscow to him or to himself? Still less could it matter to him who was appointed chief of the artillery.\n\nNot merely in these cases but continually did that old man\u2014who by experience of life had reached the conviction that thoughts and the words serving as their expression are not what move people\u2014use quite meaningless words that happened to enter his head.\n\nBut that man, so heedless of his words, did not once during the whole time of his activity utter one word inconsistent with the single aim toward which he moved throughout the whole war. Obviously in spite of himself, in very diverse circumstances, he repeatedly expressed his real thoughts with the bitter conviction that he would not be understood. Beginning with the battle of Borodin\u00f3, from which time his disagreement with those about him began, he alone said that the battle of Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, and repeated this both verbally and in his dispatches and reports up to the time of his death. He alone said that the loss of Moscow is not the loss of Russia. In reply to Lauriston\u2019s proposal of peace, he said: There can be no peace, for such is the people\u2019s will. He alone during the retreat of the French said that all our maneuvers are useless, everything is being accomplished of itself better than we could desire; that the enemy must be offered \u201ca golden bridge\u201d; that neither the Tar\u00fatino, the Vy\u00e1zma, nor the Kr\u00e1snoe battles were necessary; that we must keep some force to reach the frontier with, and that he would not sacrifice a single Russian for ten Frenchmen.\n\nAnd this courtier, as he is described to us, who lies to Arakch\u00e9ev to please the Emperor, he alone\u2014incurring thereby the Emperor\u2019s displeasure\u2014said in V\u00edlna that to carry the war beyond the frontier is useless and harmful.\n\nNor do words alone prove that only he understood the meaning of the events. His actions\u2014without the smallest deviation\u2014were all directed to one and the same threefold end: (1) to brace all his strength for conflict with the French, (2) to defeat them, and (3) to drive them out of Russia, minimizing as far as possible the sufferings of our people and of our army.\n\nThis procrastinator Kut\u00fazov, whose motto was \u201cPatience and Time,\u201d this enemy of decisive action, gave battle at Borodin\u00f3, investing the preparations for it with unparalleled solemnity. This Kut\u00fazov who before the battle of Austerlitz began said that it would be lost, he alone, in contradiction to everyone else, declared till his death that Borodin\u00f3 was a victory, despite the assurance of generals that the battle was lost and despite the fact that for an army to have to retire after winning a battle was unprecedented. He alone during the whole retreat insisted that battles, which were useless then, should not be fought, and that a new war should not be begun nor the frontiers of Russia crossed.\n\nIt is easy now to understand the significance of these events\u2014if only we abstain from attributing to the activity of the mass aims that existed only in the heads of a dozen individuals\u2014for the events and results now lie before us.\n\nBut how did that old man, alone, in opposition to the general opinion, so truly discern the importance of the people\u2019s view of the events that in all his activity he was never once untrue to it?\n\nThe source of that extraordinary power of penetrating the meaning of the events then occuring lay in the national feeling which he possessed in full purity and strength.\n\nOnly the recognition of the fact that he possessed this feeling caused the people in so strange a manner, contrary to the Tsar\u2019s wish, to select him\u2014an old man in disfavor\u2014to be their representative in the national war. And only that feeling placed him on that highest human pedestal from which he, the commander in chief, devoted all his powers not to slaying and destroying men but to saving and showing pity on them.\n\nThat simple, modest, and therefore truly great, figure could not be cast in the false mold of a European hero\u2014the supposed ruler of men\u2014that history has invented.\n\nTo a lackey no man can be great, for a lackey has his own conception of greatness.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nThe fifth of November was the first day of what is called the battle of Kr\u00e1snoe. Toward evening\u2014after much disputing and many mistakes made by generals who did not go to their proper places, and after adjutants had been sent about with counterorders\u2014when it had become plain that the enemy was everywhere in flight and that there could and would be no battle, Kut\u00fazov left Kr\u00e1snoe and went to D\u00f3broe whither his headquarters had that day been transferred.\n\nThe day was clear and frosty. Kut\u00fazov rode to D\u00f3broe on his plump little white horse, followed by an enormous suite of discontented generals who whispered among themselves behind his back. All along the road groups of French prisoners captured that day (there were seven thousand of them) were crowding to warm themselves at campfires. Near D\u00f3broe an immense crowd of tattered prisoners, buzzing with talk and wrapped and bandaged in anything they had been able to get hold of, were standing in the road beside a long row of unharnessed French guns. At the approach of the commander in chief the buzz of talk ceased and all eyes were fixed on Kut\u00fazov who, wearing a white cap with a red band and a padded overcoat that bulged on his round shoulders, moved slowly along the road on his white horse. One of the generals was reporting to him where the guns and prisoners had been captured.\n\nKut\u00fazov seemed preoccupied and did not listen to what the general was saying. He screwed up his eyes with a dissatisfied look as he gazed attentively and fixedly at these prisoners, who presented a specially wretched appearance. Most of them were disfigured by frost-bitten noses and cheeks, and nearly all had red, swollen and festering eyes.\n\nOne group of the French stood close to the road, and two of them, one of whom had his face covered with sores, were tearing a piece of raw flesh with their hands. There was something horrible and bestial in the fleeting glance they threw at the riders and in the malevolent expression with which, after a glance at Kut\u00fazov, the soldier with the sores immediately turned away and went on with what he was doing.\n\nKut\u00fazov looked long and intently at these two soldiers. He puckered his face, screwed up his eyes, and pensively swayed his head. At another spot he noticed a Russian soldier laughingly patting a Frenchman on the shoulder, saying something to him in a friendly manner, and Kut\u00fazov with the same expression on his face again swayed his head.\n\n\u201cWhat were you saying?\u201d he asked the general, who continuing his report directed the commander in chief\u2019s attention to some standards captured from the French and standing in front of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment.\n\n\u201cAh, the standards!\u201d said Kut\u00fazov, evidently detaching himself with difficulty from the thoughts that preoccupied him.\n\nHe looked about him absently. Thousands of eyes were looking at him from all sides awaiting a word from him.\n\nHe stopped in front of the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk regiment, sighed deeply, and closed his eyes. One of his suite beckoned to the soldiers carrying the standards to advance and surround the commander in chief with them. Kut\u00fazov was silent for a few seconds and then, submitting with evident reluctance to the duty imposed by his position, raised his head and began to speak. A throng of officers surrounded him. He looked attentively around at the circle of officers, recognizing several of them.\n\n\u201cI thank you all!\u201d he said, addressing the soldiers and then again the officers. In the stillness around him his slowly uttered words were distinctly heard. \u201cI thank you all for your hard and faithful service. The victory is complete and Russia will not forget you! Honor to you forever.\u201d\n\nHe paused and looked around.\n\n\u201cLower its head, lower it!\u201d he said to a soldier who had accidentally lowered the French eagle he was holding before the Preobrazh\u00e9nsk standards. \u201cLower, lower, that\u2019s it. Hurrah lads!\u201d he added, addressing the men with a rapid movement of his chin.\n\n\u201cHur-r-rah!\u201d roared thousands of voices.\n\nWhile the soldiers were shouting Kut\u00fazov leaned forward in his saddle and bowed his head, and his eye lit up with a mild and apparently ironic gleam.\n\n\u201cYou see, brothers...\u201d said he when the shouts had ceased... and all at once his voice and the expression of his face changed. It was no longer the commander in chief speaking but an ordinary old man who wanted to tell his comrades something very important.\n\nThere was a stir among the throng of officers and in the ranks of the soldiers, who moved that they might hear better what he was going to say.\n\n\u201cYou see, brothers, I know it\u2019s hard for you, but it can\u2019t be helped! Bear up; it won\u2019t be for long now! We\u2019ll see our visitors off and then we\u2019ll rest. The Tsar won\u2019t forget your service. It is hard for you, but still you are at home while they\u2014you see what they have come to,\u201d said he, pointing to the prisoners. \u201cWorse off than our poorest beggars. While they were strong we didn\u2019t spare ourselves, but now we may even pity them. They are human beings too. Isn\u2019t it so, lads?\u201d\n\nHe looked around, and in the direct, respectful, wondering gaze fixed upon him he read sympathy with what he had said. His face grew brighter and brighter with an old man\u2019s mild smile, which drew the corners of his lips and eyes into a cluster of wrinkles. He ceased speaking and bowed his head as if in perplexity.\n\n\u201cBut after all who asked them here? Serves them right, the bloody bastards!\u201d he cried, suddenly lifting his head.\n\nAnd flourishing his whip he rode off at a gallop for the first time during the whole campaign, and left the broken ranks of the soldiers laughing joyfully and shouting \u201cHurrah!\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov\u2019s words were hardly understood by the troops. No one could have repeated the field marshal\u2019s address, begun solemnly and then changing into an old man\u2019s simplehearted talk; but the hearty sincerity of that speech, the feeling of majestic triumph combined with pity for the foe and consciousness of the justice of our cause, exactly expressed by that old man\u2019s good-natured expletives, was not merely understood but lay in the soul of every soldier and found expression in their joyous and long-sustained shouts. Afterwards when one of the generals addressed Kut\u00fazov asking whether he wished his cal\u00e8che to be sent for, Kut\u00fazov in answering unexpectedly gave a sob, being evidently greatly moved.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen the troops reached their night\u2019s halting place on the eighth of November, the last day of the Kr\u00e1snoe battles, it was already growing dusk. All day it had been calm and frosty with occasional lightly falling snow and toward evening it began to clear. Through the falling snow a purple-black and starry sky showed itself and the frost grew keener.\n\nAn infantry regiment which had left Tar\u00fatino three thousand strong but now numbered only nine hundred was one of the first to arrive that night at its halting place\u2014a village on the highroad. The quartermasters who met the regiment announced that all the huts were full of sick and dead Frenchmen, cavalrymen, and members of the staff. There was only one hut available for the regimental commander.\n\nThe commander rode up to his hut. The regiment passed through the village and stacked its arms in front of the last huts.\n\nLike some huge many-limbed animal, the regiment began to prepare its lair and its food. One part of it dispersed and waded knee-deep through the snow into a birch forest to the right of the village, and immediately the sound of axes and swords, the crashing of branches, and merry voices could be heard from there. Another section amid the regimental wagons and horses which were standing in a group was busy getting out caldrons and rye biscuit, and feeding the horses. A third section scattered through the village arranging quarters for the staff officers, carrying out the French corpses that were in the huts, and dragging away boards, dry wood, and thatch from the roofs, for the campfires, or wattle fences to serve for shelter.\n\nSome fifteen men with merry shouts were shaking down the high wattle wall of a shed, the roof of which had already been removed.\n\n\u201cNow then, all together\u2014shove!\u201d cried the voices, and the huge surface of the wall, sprinkled with snow and creaking with frost, was seen swaying in the gloom of the night. The lower stakes cracked more and more and at last the wall fell, and with it the men who had been pushing it. Loud, coarse laughter and joyous shouts ensued.\n\n\u201cNow then, catch hold in twos! Hand up the lever! That\u2019s it.... Where are you shoving to?\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, all together! But wait a moment, boys... With a song!\u201d\n\nAll stood silent, and a soft, pleasant velvety voice began to sing. At the end of the third verse as the last note died away, twenty voices roared out at once: \u201cOo-oo-oo-oo! That\u2019s it. All together! Heave away, boys!...\u201d but despite their united efforts the wattle hardly moved, and in the silence that followed the heavy breathing of the men was audible.\n\n\u201cHere, you of the Sixth Company! Devils that you are! Lend a hand... will you? You may want us one of these days.\u201d\n\nSome twenty men of the Sixth Company who were on their way into the village joined the haulers, and the wattle wall, which was about thirty-five feet long and seven feet high, moved forward along the village street, swaying, pressing upon and cutting the shoulders of the gasping men.\n\n\u201cGet along... Falling? What are you stopping for? There now....\u201d\n\nMerry senseless words of abuse flowed freely.\n\n\u201cWhat are you up to?\u201d suddenly came the authoritative voice of a sergeant major who came upon the men who were hauling their burden. \u201cThere are gentry here; the general himself is in that hut, and you foul-mouthed devils, you brutes, I\u2019ll give it to you!\u201d shouted he, hitting the first man who came in his way a swinging blow on the back. \u201cCan\u2019t you make less noise?\u201d\n\nThe men became silent. The soldier who had been struck groaned and wiped his face, which had been scratched till it bled by his falling against the wattle.\n\n\u201cThere, how that devil hits out! He\u2019s made my face all bloody,\u201d said he in a frightened whisper when the sergeant major had passed on.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you like it?\u201d said a laughing voice, and moderating their tones the men moved forward.\n\nWhen they were out of the village they began talking again as loud as before, interlarding their talk with the same aimless expletives.\n\nIn the hut which the men had passed, the chief officers had gathered and were in animated talk over their tea about the events of the day and the maneuvers suggested for tomorrow. It was proposed to make a flank march to the left, cut off the Vice-King (Murat) and capture him.\n\nBy the time the soldiers had dragged the wattle fence to its place the campfires were blazing on all sides ready for cooking, the wood crackled, the snow was melting, and black shadows of soldiers flitted to and fro all over the occupied space where the snow had been trodden down.\n\nAxes and choppers were plied all around. Everything was done without any orders being given. Stores of wood were brought for the night, shelters were rigged up for the officers, caldrons were being boiled, and muskets and accouterments put in order.\n\nThe wattle wall the men had brought was set up in a semicircle by the Eighth Company as a shelter from the north, propped up by musket rests, and a campfire was built before it. They beat the tattoo, called the roll, had supper, and settled down round the fires for the night\u2014some repairing their footgear, some smoking pipes, and some stripping themselves naked to steam the lice out of their shirts.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne would have thought that under the almost incredibly wretched conditions the Russian soldiers were in at that time\u2014lacking warm boots and sheepskin coats, without a roof over their heads, in the snow with eighteen degrees of frost, and without even full rations (the commissariat did not always keep up with the troops)\u2014they would have presented a very sad and depressing spectacle.\n\nOn the contrary, the army had never under the best material conditions presented a more cheerful and animated aspect. This was because all who began to grow depressed or who lost strength were sifted out of the army day by day. All the physically or morally weak had long since been left behind and only the flower of the army\u2014physically and mentally\u2014remained.\n\nMore men collected behind the wattle fence of the Eighth Company than anywhere else. Two sergeants major were sitting with them and their campfire blazed brighter than others. For leave to sit by their wattle they demanded contributions of fuel.\n\n\u201cEh, Mak\u00e9ev! What has become of you, you son of a bitch? Are you lost or have the wolves eaten you? Fetch some more wood!\u201d shouted a red-haired and red-faced man, screwing up his eyes and blinking because of the smoke but not moving back from the fire. \u201cAnd you, Jackdaw, go and fetch some wood!\u201d said he to another soldier.\n\nThis red-haired man was neither a sergeant nor a corporal, but being robust he ordered about those weaker than himself. The soldier they called \u201cJackdaw,\u201d a thin little fellow with a sharp nose, rose obediently and was about to go but at that instant there came into the light of the fire the slender, handsome figure of a young soldier carrying a load of wood.\n\n\u201cBring it here\u2014that\u2019s fine!\u201d\n\nThey split up the wood, pressed it down on the fire, blew at it with their mouths, and fanned it with the skirts of their greatcoats, making the flames hiss and crackle. The men drew nearer and lit their pipes. The handsome young soldier who had brought the wood, setting his arms akimbo, began stamping his cold feet rapidly and deftly on the spot where he stood.\n\n\u201cMother! The dew is cold but clear.... It\u2019s well that I\u2019m a musketeer...\u201d he sang, pretending to hiccough after each syllable.\n\n\u201cLook out, your soles will fly off!\u201d shouted the red-haired man, noticing that the sole of the dancer\u2019s boot was hanging loose. \u201cWhat a fellow you are for dancing!\u201d\n\nThe dancer stopped, pulled off the loose piece of leather, and threw it on the fire.\n\n\u201cRight enough, friend,\u201d said he, and, having sat down, took out of his knapsack a scrap of blue French cloth, and wrapped it round his foot. \u201cIt\u2019s the steam that spoils them,\u201d he added, stretching out his feet toward the fire.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ll soon be issuing us new ones. They say that when we\u2019ve finished hammering them, we\u2019re to receive double kits!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd that son of a bitch Petr\u00f3v has lagged behind after all, it seems,\u201d said one sergeant major.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had an eye on him this long while,\u201d said the other.\n\n\u201cWell, he\u2019s a poor sort of soldier....\u201d\n\n\u201cBut in the Third Company they say nine men were missing yesterday.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s all very well, but when a man\u2019s feet are frozen how can he walk?\u201d\n\n\u201cEh? Don\u2019t talk nonsense!\u201d said a sergeant major.\n\n\u201cDo you want to be doing the same?\u201d said an old soldier, turning reproachfully to the man who had spoken of frozen feet.\n\n\u201cWell, you know,\u201d said the sharp-nosed man they called Jackdaw in a squeaky and unsteady voice, raising himself at the other side of the fire, \u201ca plump man gets thin, but for a thin one it\u2019s death. Take me, now! I\u2019ve got no strength left,\u201d he added, with sudden resolution turning to the sergeant major. \u201cTell them to send me to hospital; I\u2019m aching all over; anyway I shan\u2019t be able to keep up.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019ll do, that\u2019ll do!\u201d replied the sergeant major quietly.\n\nThe soldier said no more and the talk went on.\n\n\u201cWhat a lot of those Frenchies were taken today, and the fact is that not one of them had what you might call real boots on,\u201d said a soldier, starting a new theme. \u201cThey were no more than make-believes.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Cossacks have taken their boots. They were clearing the hut for the colonel and carried them out. It was pitiful to see them, boys,\u201d put in the dancer. \u201cAs they turned them over one seemed still alive and, would you believe it, he jabbered something in their lingo.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they\u2019re a clean folk, lads,\u201d the first man went on; \u201che was white\u2014as white as birchbark\u2014and some of them are such fine fellows, you might think they were nobles.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, what do you think? They make soldiers of all classes there.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut they don\u2019t understand our talk at all,\u201d said the dancer with a puzzled smile. \u201cI asked him whose subject he was, and he jabbered in his own way. A queer lot!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s strange, friends,\u201d continued the man who had wondered at their whiteness, \u201cthe peasants at Mozh\u00e1ysk were saying that when they began burying the dead\u2014where the battle was you know\u2014well, those dead had been lying there for nearly a month, and says the peasant, \u2018they lie as white as paper, clean, and not as much smell as a puff of powder smoke.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cWas it from the cold?\u201d asked someone.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a clever fellow! From the cold indeed! Why, it was hot. If it had been from the cold, ours would not have rotted either. \u2018But,\u2019 he says, \u2018go up to ours and they are all rotten and maggoty. So,\u2019 he says, \u2018we tie our faces up with kerchiefs and turn our heads away as we drag them off: we can hardly do it. But theirs,\u2019 he says, \u2018are white as paper and not so much smell as a whiff of gunpowder.\u2019\u201d\n\nAll were silent.\n\n\u201cIt must be from their food,\u201d said the sergeant major. \u201cThey used to gobble the same food as the gentry.\u201d\n\nNo one contradicted him.\n\n\u201cThat peasant near Mozh\u00e1ysk where the battle was said the men were all called up from ten villages around and they carted for twenty days and still didn\u2019t finish carting the dead away. And as for the wolves, he says...\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was a real battle,\u201d said an old soldier. \u201cIt\u2019s the only one worth remembering; but since that... it\u2019s only been tormenting folk.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd do you know, Daddy, the day before yesterday we ran at them and, my word, they didn\u2019t let us get near before they just threw down their muskets and went on their knees. \u2018Pardon!\u2019 they say. That\u2019s only one case. They say Pl\u00e1tov took \u2018Poleon himself twice. But he didn\u2019t know the right charm. He catches him and catches him\u2014no good! He turns into a bird in his hands and flies away. And there\u2019s no way of killing him either.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a first-class liar, Kisel\u00ebv, when I come to look at you!\u201d\n\n\u201cLiar, indeed! It\u2019s the real truth.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf he fell into my hands, when I\u2019d caught him I\u2019d bury him in the ground with an aspen stake to fix him down. What a lot of men he\u2019s ruined!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, anyhow we\u2019re going to end it. He won\u2019t come here again,\u201d remarked the old soldier, yawning.\n\nThe conversation flagged, and the soldiers began settling down to sleep.\n\n\u201cLook at the stars. It\u2019s wonderful how they shine! You would think the women had spread out their linen,\u201d said one of the men, gazing with admiration at the Milky Way.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a sign of a good harvest next year.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe shall want some more wood.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou warm your back and your belly gets frozen. That\u2019s queer.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Lord!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat are you pushing for? Is the fire only for you? Look how he\u2019s sprawling!\u201d\n\nIn the silence that ensued, the snoring of those who had fallen asleep could be heard. Others turned over and warmed themselves, now and again exchanging a few words. From a campfire a hundred paces off came a sound of general, merry laughter.\n\n\u201cHark at them roaring there in the Fifth Company!\u201d said one of the soldiers, \u201cand what a lot of them there are!\u201d\n\nOne of the men got up and went over to the Fifth Company.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re having such fun,\u201d said he, coming back. \u201cTwo Frenchies have turned up. One\u2019s quite frozen and the other\u2019s an awful swaggerer. He\u2019s singing songs....\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go across and have a look....\u201d\n\nAnd several of the men went over to the Fifth Company.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nThe Fifth company was bivouacking at the very edge of the forest. A huge campfire was blazing brightly in the midst of the snow, lighting up the branches of trees heavy with hoarfrost.\n\nAbout midnight they heard the sound of steps in the snow of the forest, and the crackling of dry branches.\n\n\u201cA bear, lads,\u201d said one of the men.\n\nThey all raised their heads to listen, and out of the forest into the bright firelight stepped two strangely clad human figures clinging to one another.\n\nThese were two Frenchmen who had been hiding in the forest. They came up to the fire, hoarsely uttering something in a language our soldiers did not understand. One was taller than the other; he wore an officer\u2019s hat and seemed quite exhausted. On approaching the fire he had been going to sit down, but fell. The other, a short sturdy soldier with a shawl tied round his head, was stronger. He raised his companion and said something, pointing to his mouth. The soldiers surrounded the Frenchmen, spread a greatcoat on the ground for the sick man, and brought some buckwheat porridge and vodka for both of them.\n\nThe exhausted French officer was Ramballe and the man with his head wrapped in the shawl was Morel, his orderly.\n\nWhen Morel had drunk some vodka and finished his bowl of porridge he suddenly became unnaturally merry and chattered incessantly to the soldiers, who could not understand him. Ramballe refused food and resting his head on his elbow lay silent beside the campfire, looking at the Russian soldiers with red and vacant eyes. Occasionally he emitted a long-drawn groan and then again became silent. Morel, pointing to his shoulders, tried to impress on the soldiers the fact that Ramballe was an officer and ought to be warmed. A Russian officer who had come up to the fire sent to ask his colonel whether he would not take a French officer into his hut to warm him, and when the messenger returned and said that the colonel wished the officer to be brought to him, Ramballe was told to go. He rose and tried to walk, but staggered and would have fallen had not a soldier standing by held him up.\n\n\u201cYou won\u2019t do it again, eh?\u201d said one of the soldiers, winking and turning mockingly to Ramballe.\n\n\u201cOh, you fool! Why talk rubbish, lout that you are\u2014a real peasant!\u201d came rebukes from all sides addressed to the jesting soldier.\n\nThey surrounded Ramballe, lifted him on the crossed arms of two soldiers, and carried him to the hut. Ramballe put his arms around their necks while they carried him and began wailing plaintively:\n\n\u201cOh, you fine fellows, my kind, kind friends! These are men! Oh, my brave, kind friends,\u201d and he leaned his head against the shoulder of one of the men like a child.\n\nMeanwhile Morel was sitting in the best place by the fire, surrounded by the soldiers.\n\nMorel, a short sturdy Frenchman with inflamed and streaming eyes, was wearing a woman\u2019s cloak and had a shawl tied woman fashion round his head over his cap. He was evidently tipsy, and was singing a French song in a hoarse broken voice, with an arm thrown round the nearest soldier. The soldiers simply held their sides as they watched him.\n\n\u201cNow then, now then, teach us how it goes! I\u2019ll soon pick it up. How is it?\u201d said the man\u2014a singer and a wag\u2014whom Morel was embracing.\n\n\u201cVive Henri Quatre! Vive ce roi valiant!\u201d sang Morel, winking. \u201cCe diable \u00e0 quatre...\u201d\n\n\u201cVivarika! Vif-seruvaru! Sedyablyaka!\u201d repeated the soldier, flourishing his arm and really catching the tune.\n\n\u201cBravo! Ha, ha, ha!\u201d rose their rough, joyous laughter from all sides.\n\nMorel, wrinkling up his face, laughed too.\n\n\u201cWell, go on, go on!\u201d\n\n\n\u201cQui eut le triple talent,\nDe boire, de battre,\nEt d\u2019\u00eatre un vert galant.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cIt goes smoothly, too. Well, now, Zalet\u00e1ev!\u201d\n\n\u201cKe...\u201d Zalet\u00e1ev, brought out with effort: \u201cke-e-e-e,\u201d he drawled, laboriously pursing his lips, \u201cle-trip-ta-la-de-bu-de-ba, e de-tra-va-ga-la\u201d he sang.\n\n\u201cFine! Just like the Frenchie! Oh, ho ho! Do you want some more to eat?\u201d\n\n\u201cGive him some porridge: it takes a long time to get filled up after starving.\u201d\n\nThey gave him some more porridge and Morel with a laugh set to work on his third bowl. All the young soldiers smiled gaily as they watched him. The older men, who thought it undignified to amuse themselves with such nonsense, continued to lie at the opposite side of the fire, but one would occasionally raise himself on an elbow and glance at Morel with a smile.\n\n\u201cThey are men too,\u201d said one of them as he wrapped himself up in his coat. \u201cEven wormwood grows on its own root.\u201d\n\n\u201cO Lord, O Lord! How starry it is! Tremendous! That means a hard frost....\u201d\n\nThey all grew silent. The stars, as if knowing that no one was looking at them, began to disport themselves in the dark sky: now flaring up, now vanishing, now trembling, they were busy whispering something gladsome and mysterious to one another.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThe French army melted away at the uniform rate of a mathematical progression; and that crossing of the Ber\u00ebzina about which so much has been written was only one intermediate stage in its destruction, and not at all the decisive episode of the campaign. If so much has been and still is written about the Ber\u00ebzina, on the French side this is only because at the broken bridge across that river the calamities their army had been previously enduring were suddenly concentrated at one moment into a tragic spectacle that remained in every memory, and on the Russian side merely because in Petersburg\u2014far from the seat of war\u2014a plan (again one of Pfuel\u2019s) had been devised to catch Napoleon in a strategic trap at the Ber\u00ebzina River. Everyone assured himself that all would happen according to plan, and therefore insisted that it was just the crossing of the Ber\u00ebzina that destroyed the French army. In reality the results of the crossing were much less disastrous to the French\u2014in guns and men lost\u2014than Kr\u00e1snoe had been, as the figures show.\n\nThe sole importance of the crossing of the Ber\u00ebzina lies in the fact that it plainly and indubitably proved the fallacy of all the plans for cutting off the enemy\u2019s retreat and the soundness of the only possible line of action\u2014the one Kut\u00fazov and the general mass of the army demanded\u2014namely, simply to follow the enemy up. The French crowd fled at a continually increasing speed and all its energy was directed to reaching its goal. It fled like a wounded animal and it was impossible to block its path. This was shown not so much by the arrangements it made for crossing as by what took place at the bridges. When the bridges broke down, unarmed soldiers, people from Moscow and women with children who were with the French transport, all\u2014carried on by vis inerti\u00e6\u2014pressed forward into boats and into the ice-covered water and did not surrender.\n\nThat impulse was reasonable. The condition of fugitives and of pursuers was equally bad. As long as they remained with their own people each might hope for help from his fellows and the definite place he held among them. But those who surrendered, while remaining in the same pitiful plight, would be on a lower level to claim a share in the necessities of life. The French did not need to be informed of the fact that half the prisoners\u2014with whom the Russians did not know what to do\u2014perished of cold and hunger despite their captors\u2019 desire to save them; they felt that it could not be otherwise. The most compassionate Russian commanders, those favorable to the French\u2014and even the Frenchmen in the Russian service\u2014could do nothing for the prisoners. The French perished from the conditions to which the Russian army was itself exposed. It was impossible to take bread and clothes from our hungry and indispensable soldiers to give to the French who, though not harmful, or hated, or guilty, were simply unnecessary. Some Russians even did that, but they were exceptions.\n\nCertain destruction lay behind the French but in front there was hope. Their ships had been burned, there was no salvation save in collective flight, and on that the whole strength of the French was concentrated.\n\nThe farther they fled the more wretched became the plight of the remnant, especially after the Ber\u00ebzina, on which (in consequence of the Petersburg plan) special hopes had been placed by the Russians, and the keener grew the passions of the Russian commanders, who blamed one another and Kut\u00fazov most of all. Anticipation that the failure of the Petersburg Ber\u00ebzina plan would be attributed to Kut\u00fazov led to dissatisfaction, contempt, and ridicule, more and more strongly expressed. The ridicule and contempt were of course expressed in a respectful form, making it impossible for him to ask wherein he was to blame. They did not talk seriously to him; when reporting to him or asking for his sanction they appeared to be fulfilling a regrettable formality, but they winked behind his back and tried to mislead him at every turn.\n\nBecause they could not understand him all these people assumed that it was useless to talk to the old man; that he would never grasp the profundity of their plans, that he would answer with his phrases (which they thought were mere phrases) about a \u201cgolden bridge,\u201d about the impossibility of crossing the frontier with a crowd of tatterdemalions, and so forth. They had heard all that before. And all he said\u2014that it was necessary to await provisions, or that the men had no boots\u2014was so simple, while what they proposed was so complicated and clever, that it was evident that he was old and stupid and that they, though not in power, were commanders of genius.\n\nAfter the junction with the army of the brilliant admiral and Petersburg hero Wittgenstein, this mood and the gossip of the staff reached their maximum. Kut\u00fazov saw this and merely sighed and shrugged his shoulders. Only once, after the affair of the Ber\u00ebzina, did he get angry and write to Bennigsen (who reported separately to the Emperor) the following letter:\n\n\u201cOn account of your spells of ill health, will your excellency please be so good as to set off for Kal\u00faga on receipt of this, and there await further commands and appointments from His Imperial Majesty.\u201d\n\nBut after Bennigsen\u2019s departure, the Grand Duke Tsar\u00e9vich Constantine P\u00e1vlovich joined the army. He had taken part in the beginning of the campaign but had subsequently been removed from the army by Kut\u00fazov. Now having come to the army, he informed Kut\u00fazov of the Emperor\u2019s displeasure at the poor success of our forces and the slowness of their advance. The Emperor intended to join the army personally in a few days\u2019 time.\n\nThe old man, experienced in court as well as in military affairs\u2014this same Kut\u00fazov who in August had been chosen commander in chief against the sovereign\u2019s wishes and who had removed the Grand Duke and heir-apparent from the army\u2014who on his own authority and contrary to the Emperor\u2019s will had decided on the abandonment of Moscow, now realized at once that his day was over, that his part was played, and that the power he was supposed to hold was no longer his. And he understood this not merely from the attitude of the court. He saw on the one hand that the military business in which he had played his part was ended and felt that his mission was accomplished; and at the same time he began to be conscious of the physical weariness of his aged body and of the necessity of physical rest.\n\nOn the twenty-ninth of November Kut\u00fazov entered V\u00edlna\u2014his \u201cdear V\u00edlna\u201d as he called it. Twice during his career Kut\u00fazov had been governor of V\u00edlna. In that wealthy town, which had not been injured, he found old friends and associations, besides the comforts of life of which he had so long been deprived. And he suddenly turned from the cares of army and state and, as far as the passions that seethed around him allowed, immersed himself in the quiet life to which he had formerly been accustomed, as if all that was taking place and all that had still to be done in the realm of history did not concern him at all.\n\nChichag\u00f3v, one of the most zealous \u201ccutters-off\u201d and \u201cbreakers-up,\u201d who had first wanted to effect a diversion in Greece and then in Warsaw but never wished to go where he was sent: Chichag\u00f3v, noted for the boldness with which he spoke to the Emperor, and who considered Kut\u00fazov to be under an obligation to him because when he was sent to make peace with Turkey in 1811 independently of Kut\u00fazov, and found that peace had already been concluded, he admitted to the Emperor that the merit of securing that peace was really Kut\u00fazov\u2019s; this Chichag\u00f3v was the first to meet Kut\u00fazov at the castle where the latter was to stay. In undress naval uniform, with a dirk, and holding his cap under his arm, he handed Kut\u00fazov a garrison report and the keys of the town. The contemptuously respectful attitude of the younger men to the old man in his dotage was expressed in the highest degree by the behavior of Chichag\u00f3v, who knew of the accusations that were being directed against Kut\u00fazov.\n\nWhen speaking to Chichag\u00f3v, Kut\u00fazov incidentally mentioned that the vehicles packed with china that had been captured from him at Bor\u00edsov had been recovered and would be restored to him.\n\n\u201cYou mean to imply that I have nothing to eat out of.... On the contrary, I can supply you with everything even if you want to give dinner parties,\u201d warmly replied Chichag\u00f3v, who tried by every word he spoke to prove his own rectitude and therefore imagined Kut\u00fazov to be animated by the same desire.\n\nKut\u00fazov, shrugging his shoulders, replied with his subtle penetrating smile: \u201cI meant merely to say what I said.\u201d\n\nContrary to the Emperor\u2019s wish Kut\u00fazov detained the greater part of the army at V\u00edlna. Those about him said that he became extraordinarily slack and physically feeble during his stay in that town. He attended to army affairs reluctantly, left everything to his generals, and while awaiting the Emperor\u2019s arrival led a dissipated life.\n\nHaving left Petersburg on the seventh of December with his suite\u2014Count Tolst\u00f3y, Prince Volk\u00f3nski, Arakch\u00e9ev, and others\u2014the Emperor reached V\u00edlna on the eleventh, and in his traveling sleigh drove straight to the castle. In spite of the severe frost some hundred generals and staff officers in full parade uniform stood in front of the castle, as well as a guard of honor of the Sem\u00ebnov regiment.\n\nA courier who galloped to the castle in advance, in a troyka with three foam-flecked horses, shouted \u201cComing!\u201d and Konovn\u00edtsyn rushed into the vestibule to inform Kut\u00fazov, who was waiting in the hall porter\u2019s little lodge.\n\nA minute later the old man\u2019s large stout figure in full-dress uniform, his chest covered with orders and a scarf drawn round his stomach, waddled out into the porch. He put on his hat with its peaks to the sides and, holding his gloves in his hand and walking with an effort sideways down the steps to the level of the street, took in his hand the report he had prepared for the Emperor.\n\nThere was running to and fro and whispering; another troyka flew furiously up, and then all eyes were turned on an approaching sleigh in which the figures of the Emperor and Volk\u00f3nski could already be descried.\n\nFrom the habit of fifty years all this had a physically agitating effect on the old general. He carefully and hastily felt himself all over, readjusted his hat, and pulling himself together drew himself up and, at the very moment when the Emperor, having alighted from the sleigh, lifted his eyes to him, handed him the report and began speaking in his smooth, ingratiating voice.\n\nThe Emperor with a rapid glance scanned Kut\u00fazov from head to foot, frowned for an instant, but immediately mastering himself went up to the old man, extended his arms and embraced him. And this embrace too, owing to a long-standing impression related to his innermost feelings, had its usual effect on Kut\u00fazov and he gave a sob.\n\nThe Emperor greeted the officers and the Sem\u00ebnov guard, and again pressing the old man\u2019s hand went with him into the castle.\n\nWhen alone with the field marshal the Emperor expressed his dissatisfaction at the slowness of the pursuit and at the mistakes made at Kr\u00e1snoe and the Ber\u00ebzina, and informed him of his intentions for a future campaign abroad. Kut\u00fazov made no rejoinder or remark. The same submissive, expressionless look with which he had listened to the Emperor\u2019s commands on the field of Austerlitz seven years before settled on his face now.\n\nWhen Kut\u00fazov came out of the study and with lowered head was crossing the ballroom with his heavy waddling gait, he was arrested by someone\u2019s voice saying:\n\n\u201cYour Serene Highness!\u201d\n\nKut\u00fazov raised his head and looked for a long while into the eyes of Count Tolst\u00f3y, who stood before him holding a silver salver on which lay a small object. Kut\u00fazov seemed not to understand what was expected of him.\n\nSuddenly he seemed to remember; a scarcely perceptible smile flashed across his puffy face, and bowing low and respectfully he took the object that lay on the salver. It was the Order of St. George of the First Class.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nNext day the field marshal gave a dinner and ball which the Emperor honored by his presence. Kut\u00fazov had received the Order of St. George of the First Class and the Emperor showed him the highest honors, but everyone knew of the imperial dissatisfaction with him. The proprieties were observed and the Emperor was the first to set that example, but everybody understood that the old man was blameworthy and good-for-nothing. When Kut\u00fazov, conforming to a custom of Catherine\u2019s day, ordered the standards that had been captured to be lowered at the Emperor\u2019s feet on his entering the ballroom, the Emperor made a wry face and muttered something in which some people caught the words, \u201cthe old comedian.\u201d\n\nThe Emperor\u2019s displeasure with Kut\u00fazov was specially increased at V\u00edlna by the fact that Kut\u00fazov evidently could not or would not understand the importance of the coming campaign.\n\nWhen on the following morning the Emperor said to the officers assembled about him: \u201cYou have not only saved Russia, you have saved Europe!\u201d they all understood that the war was not ended.\n\nKut\u00fazov alone would not see this and openly expressed his opinion that no fresh war could improve the position or add to the glory of Russia, but could only spoil and lower the glorious position that Russia had gained. He tried to prove to the Emperor the impossibility of levying fresh troops, spoke of the hardships already endured by the people, of the possibility of failure and so forth.\n\nThis being the field marshal\u2019s frame of mind he was naturally regarded as merely a hindrance and obstacle to the impending war.\n\nTo avoid unpleasant encounters with the old man, the natural method was to do what had been done with him at Austerlitz and with Barclay at the beginning of the Russian campaign\u2014to transfer the authority to the Emperor himself, thus cutting the ground from under the commander in chief\u2019s feet without upsetting the old man by informing him of the change.\n\nWith this object his staff was gradually reconstructed and its real strength removed and transferred to the Emperor. Toll, Konovn\u00edtsyn, and Erm\u00f3lov received fresh appointments. Everyone spoke loudly of the field marshal\u2019s great weakness and failing health.\n\nHis health had to be bad for his place to be taken away and given to another. And in fact his health was poor.\n\nSo naturally, simply, and gradually\u2014just as he had come from Turkey to the Treasury in Petersburg to recruit the militia, and then to the army when he was needed there\u2014now when his part was played out, Kut\u00fazov\u2019s place was taken by a new and necessary performer.\n\nThe war of 1812, besides its national significance dear to every Russian heart, was now to assume another, a European, significance.\n\nThe movement of peoples from west to east was to be succeeded by a movement of peoples from east to west, and for this fresh war another leader was necessary, having qualities and views differing from Kut\u00fazov\u2019s and animated by different motives.\n\nAlexander I was as necessary for the movement of the peoples from east to west and for the refixing of national frontiers as Kut\u00fazov had been for the salvation and glory of Russia.\n\nKut\u00fazov did not understand what Europe, the balance of power, or Napoleon meant. He could not understand it. For the representative of the Russian people, after the enemy had been destroyed and Russia had been liberated and raised to the summit of her glory, there was nothing left to do as a Russian. Nothing remained for the representative of the national war but to die, and Kut\u00fazov died.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs generally happens, Pierre did not feel the full effects of the physical privation and strain he had suffered as prisoner until after they were over. After his liberation he reached Or\u00ebl, and on the third day there, when preparing to go to Kiev, he fell ill and was laid up for three months. He had what the doctors termed \u201cbilious fever.\u201d But despite the fact that the doctors treated him, bled him, and gave him medicines to drink, he recovered.\n\nScarcely any impression was left on Pierre\u2019s mind by all that happened to him from the time of his rescue till his illness. He remembered only the dull gray weather now rainy and now snowy, internal physical distress, and pains in his feet and side. He remembered a general impression of the misfortunes and sufferings of people and of being worried by the curiosity of officers and generals who questioned him, he also remembered his difficulty in procuring a conveyance and horses, and above all he remembered his incapacity to think and feel all that time. On the day of his rescue he had seen the body of P\u00e9tya Rost\u00f3v. That same day he had learned that Prince Andrew, after surviving the battle of Borodin\u00f3 for more than a month had recently died in the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 house at Yarosl\u00e1vl, and Den\u00edsov who told him this news also mentioned H\u00e9l\u00e8ne\u2019s death, supposing that Pierre had heard of it long before. All this at the time seemed merely strange to Pierre: he felt he could not grasp its significance. Just then he was only anxious to get away as quickly as possible from places where people were killing one another, to some peaceful refuge where he could recover himself, rest, and think over all the strange new facts he had learned; but on reaching Or\u00ebl he immediately fell ill. When he came to himself after his illness he saw in attendance on him two of his servants, Ter\u00e9nty and V\u00e1ska, who had come from Moscow; and also his cousin the eldest princess, who had been living on his estate at El\u00e9ts and hearing of his rescue and illness had come to look after him.\n\nIt was only gradually during his convalescence that Pierre lost the impressions he had become accustomed to during the last few months and got used to the idea that no one would oblige him to go anywhere tomorrow, that no one would deprive him of his warm bed, and that he would be sure to get his dinner, tea, and supper. But for a long time in his dreams he still saw himself in the conditions of captivity. In the same way little by little he came to understand the news he had been told after his rescue, about the death of Prince Andrew, the death of his wife, and the destruction of the French.\n\nA joyous feeling of freedom\u2014that complete inalienable freedom natural to man which he had first experienced at the first halt outside Moscow\u2014filled Pierre\u2019s soul during his convalescence. He was surprised to find that this inner freedom, which was independent of external conditions, now had as it were an additional setting of external liberty. He was alone in a strange town, without acquaintances. No one demanded anything of him or sent him anywhere. He had all he wanted: the thought of his wife which had been a continual torment to him was no longer there, since she was no more.\n\n\u201cOh, how good! How splendid!\u201d said he to himself when a cleanly laid table was moved up to him with savory beef tea, or when he lay down for the night on a soft clean bed, or when he remembered that the French had gone and that his wife was no more. \u201cOh, how good, how splendid!\u201d\n\nAnd by old habit he asked himself the question: \u201cWell, and what then? What am I going to do?\u201d And he immediately gave himself the answer: \u201cWell, I shall live. Ah, how splendid!\u201d\n\nThe very question that had formerly tormented him, the thing he had continually sought to find\u2014the aim of life\u2014no longer existed for him now. That search for the aim of life had not merely disappeared temporarily\u2014he felt that it no longer existed for him and could not present itself again. And this very absence of an aim gave him the complete, joyous sense of freedom which constituted his happiness at this time.\n\nHe could not see an aim, for he now had faith\u2014not faith in any kind of rule, or words, or ideas, but faith in an ever-living, ever-manifest God. Formerly he had sought Him in aims he set himself. That search for an aim had been simply a search for God, and suddenly in his captivity he had learned not by words or reasoning but by direct feeling what his nurse had told him long ago: that God is here and everywhere. In his captivity he had learned that in Karat\u00e1ev God was greater, more infinite and unfathomable than in the Architect of the Universe recognized by the Freemasons. He felt like a man who after straining his eyes to see into the far distance finds what he sought at his very feet. All his life he had looked over the heads of the men around him, when he should have merely looked in front of him without straining his eyes.\n\nIn the past he had never been able to find that great inscrutable infinite something. He had only felt that it must exist somewhere and had looked for it. In everything near and comprehensible he had seen only what was limited, petty, commonplace, and senseless. He had equipped himself with a mental telescope and looked into remote space, where petty worldliness hiding itself in misty distance had seemed to him great and infinite merely because it was not clearly seen. And such had European life, politics, Freemasonry, philosophy, and philanthropy seemed to him. But even then, at moments of weakness as he had accounted them, his mind had penetrated to those distances and he had there seen the same pettiness, worldliness, and senselessness. Now, however, he had learned to see the great, eternal, and infinite in everything, and therefore\u2014to see it and enjoy its contemplation\u2014he naturally threw away the telescope through which he had till now gazed over men\u2019s heads, and gladly regarded the ever-changing, eternally great, unfathomable, and infinite life around him. And the closer he looked the more tranquil and happy he became. That dreadful question, \u201cWhat for?\u201d which had formerly destroyed all his mental edifices, no longer existed for him. To that question, \u201cWhat for?\u201d a simple answer was now always ready in his soul: \u201cBecause there is a God, that God without whose will not one hair falls from a man\u2019s head.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nIn external ways Pierre had hardly changed at all. In appearance he was just what he used to be. As before he was absent-minded and seemed occupied not with what was before his eyes but with something special of his own. The difference between his former and present self was that formerly when he did not grasp what lay before him or was said to him, he had puckered his forehead painfully as if vainly seeking to distinguish something at a distance. At present he still forgot what was said to him and still did not see what was before his eyes, but he now looked with a scarcely perceptible and seemingly ironic smile at what was before him and listened to what was said, though evidently seeing and hearing something quite different. Formerly he had appeared to be a kindhearted but unhappy man, and so people had been inclined to avoid him. Now a smile at the joy of life always played round his lips, and sympathy for others shone in his eyes with a questioning look as to whether they were as contented as he was, and people felt pleased by his presence.\n\nPreviously he had talked a great deal, grew excited when he talked, and seldom listened; now he was seldom carried away in conversation and knew how to listen so that people readily told him their most intimate secrets.\n\nThe princess, who had never liked Pierre and had been particularly hostile to him since she had felt herself under obligations to him after the old count\u2019s death, now after staying a short time in Or\u00ebl\u2014where she had come intending to show Pierre that in spite of his ingratitude she considered it her duty to nurse him\u2014felt to her surprise and vexation that she had become fond of him. Pierre did not in any way seek her approval, he merely studied her with interest. Formerly she had felt that he regarded her with indifference and irony, and so had shrunk into herself as she did with others and had shown him only the combative side of her nature; but now he seemed to be trying to understand the most intimate places of her heart, and, mistrustfully at first but afterwards gratefully, she let him see the hidden, kindly sides of her character.\n\nThe most cunning man could not have crept into her confidence more successfully, evoking memories of the best times of her youth and showing sympathy with them. Yet Pierre\u2019s cunning consisted simply in finding pleasure in drawing out the human qualities of the embittered, hard, and (in her own way) proud princess.\n\n\u201cYes, he is a very, very kind man when he is not under the influence of bad people but of people such as myself,\u201d thought she.\n\nHis servants too\u2014Ter\u00e9nty and V\u00e1ska\u2014in their own way noticed the change that had taken place in Pierre. They considered that he had become much \u201csimpler.\u201d Ter\u00e9nty, when he had helped him undress and wished him good night, often lingered with his master\u2019s boots in his hands and clothes over his arm, to see whether he would not start a talk. And Pierre, noticing that Ter\u00e9nty wanted a chat, generally kept him there.\n\n\u201cWell, tell me... now, how did you get food?\u201d he would ask.\n\nAnd Ter\u00e9nty would begin talking of the destruction of Moscow, and of the old count, and would stand for a long time holding the clothes and talking, or sometimes listening to Pierre\u2019s stories, and then would go out into the hall with a pleasant sense of intimacy with his master and affection for him.\n\nThe doctor who attended Pierre and visited him every day, though he considered it his duty as a doctor to pose as a man whose every moment was of value to suffering humanity, would sit for hours with Pierre telling him his favorite anecdotes and his observations on the characters of his patients in general, and especially of the ladies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to talk to a man like that; he is no", "sequence": 28}, {"offset": 2900000, "text": "t like our provincials,\u201d he would say.\n\nThere were several prisoners from the French army in Or\u00ebl, and the doctor brought one of them, a young Italian, to see Pierre.\n\nThis officer began visiting Pierre, and the princess used to make fun of the tenderness the Italian expressed for him.\n\nThe Italian seemed happy only when he could come to see Pierre, talk with him, tell him about his past, his life at home, and his love, and pour out to him his indignation against the French and especially against Napoleon.\n\n\u201cIf all Russians are in the least like you, it is sacrilege to fight such a nation,\u201d he said to Pierre. \u201cYou, who have suffered so from the French, do not even feel animosity toward them.\u201d\n\nPierre had evoked the passionate affection of the Italian merely by evoking the best side of his nature and taking a pleasure in so doing.\n\nDuring the last days of Pierre\u2019s stay in Or\u00ebl his old Masonic acquaintance Count Willarski, who had introduced him to the lodge in 1807, came to see him. Willarski was married to a Russian heiress who had a large estate in Or\u00ebl province, and he occupied a temporary post in the commissariat department in that town.\n\nHearing that Bez\u00fakhov was in Or\u00ebl, Willarski, though they had never been intimate, came to him with the professions of friendship and intimacy that people who meet in a desert generally express for one another. Willarski felt dull in Or\u00ebl and was pleased to meet a man of his own circle and, as he supposed, of similar interests.\n\nBut to his surprise Willarski soon noticed that Pierre had lagged much behind the times, and had sunk, as he expressed it to himself, into apathy and egotism.\n\n\u201cYou are letting yourself go, my dear fellow,\u201d he said.\n\nBut for all that Willarski found it pleasanter now than it had been formerly to be with Pierre, and came to see him every day. To Pierre as he looked at and listened to Willarski, it seemed strange to think that he had been like that himself but a short time before.\n\nWillarski was a married man with a family, busy with his family affairs, his wife\u2019s affairs, and his official duties. He regarded all these occupations as hindrances to life, and considered that they were all contemptible because their aim was the welfare of himself and his family. Military, administrative, political, and Masonic interests continually absorbed his attention. And Pierre, without trying to change the other\u2019s views and without condemning him, but with the quiet, joyful, and amused smile now habitual to him, was interested in this strange though very familiar phenomenon.\n\nThere was a new feature in Pierre\u2019s relations with Willarski, with the princess, with the doctor, and with all the people he now met, which gained for him the general good will. This was his acknowledgment of the impossibility of changing a man\u2019s convictions by words, and his recognition of the possibility of everyone thinking, feeling, and seeing things each from his own point of view. This legitimate peculiarity of each individual which used to excite and irritate Pierre now became a basis of the sympathy he felt for, and the interest he took in, other people. The difference, and sometimes complete contradiction, between men\u2019s opinions and their lives, and between one man and another, pleased him and drew from him an amused and gentle smile.\n\nIn practical matters Pierre unexpectedly felt within himself a center of gravity he had previously lacked. Formerly all pecuniary questions, especially requests for money to which, as an extremely wealthy man, he was very exposed, produced in him a state of hopeless agitation and perplexity. \u201cTo give or not to give?\u201d he had asked himself. \u201cI have it and he needs it. But someone else needs it still more. Who needs it most? And perhaps they are both impostors?\u201d In the old days he had been unable to find a way out of all these surmises and had given to all who asked as long as he had anything to give. Formerly he had been in a similar state of perplexity with regard to every question concerning his property, when one person advised one thing and another something else.\n\nNow to his surprise he found that he no longer felt either doubt or perplexity about these questions. There was now within him a judge who by some rule unknown to him decided what should or should not be done.\n\nHe was as indifferent as heretofore to money matters, but now he felt certain of what ought and what ought not to be done. The first time he had recourse to his new judge was when a French prisoner, a colonel, came to him and, after talking a great deal about his exploits, concluded by making what amounted to a demand that Pierre should give him four thousand francs to send to his wife and children. Pierre refused without the least difficulty or effort, and was afterwards surprised how simple and easy had been what used to appear so insurmountably difficult. At the same time that he refused the colonel\u2019s demand he made up his mind that he must have recourse to artifice when leaving Or\u00ebl, to induce the Italian officer to accept some money of which he was evidently in need. A further proof to Pierre of his own more settled outlook on practical matters was furnished by his decision with regard to his wife\u2019s debts and to the rebuilding of his houses in and near Moscow.\n\nHis head steward came to him at Or\u00ebl and Pierre reckoned up with him his diminished income. The burning of Moscow had cost him, according to the head steward\u2019s calculation, about two million rubles.\n\nTo console Pierre for these losses the head steward gave him an estimate showing that despite these losses his income would not be diminished but would even be increased if he refused to pay his wife\u2019s debts which he was under no obligation to meet, and did not rebuild his Moscow house and the country house on his Moscow estate, which had cost him eighty thousand rubles a year and brought in nothing.\n\n\u201cYes, of course that\u2019s true,\u201d said Pierre with a cheerful smile. \u201cI don\u2019t need all that at all. By being ruined I have become much richer.\u201d\n\nBut in January Sav\u00e9lich came from Moscow and gave him an account of the state of things there, and spoke of the estimate an architect had made of the cost of rebuilding the town and country houses, speaking of this as of a settled matter. About the same time he received letters from Prince Vas\u00edli and other Petersburg acquaintances speaking of his wife\u2019s debts. And Pierre decided that the steward\u2019s proposals which had so pleased him were wrong and that he must go to Petersburg and settle his wife\u2019s affairs and must rebuild in Moscow. Why this was necessary he did not know, but he knew for certain that it was necessary. His income would be reduced by three fourths, but he felt it must be done.\n\nWillarski was going to Moscow and they agreed to travel together.\n\nDuring the whole time of his convalescence in Or\u00ebl Pierre had experienced a feeling of joy, freedom, and life; but when during his journey he found himself in the open world and saw hundreds of new faces, that feeling was intensified. Throughout his journey he felt like a schoolboy on holiday. Everyone\u2014the stagecoach driver, the post-house overseers, the peasants on the roads and in the villages\u2014had a new significance for him. The presence and remarks of Willarski who continually deplored the ignorance and poverty of Russia and its backwardness compared with Europe only heightened Pierre\u2019s pleasure. Where Willarski saw deadness Pierre saw an extraordinary strength and vitality\u2014the strength which in that vast space amid the snows maintained the life of this original, peculiar, and unique people. He did not contradict Willarski and even seemed to agree with him\u2014an apparent agreement being the simplest way to avoid discussions that could lead to nothing\u2014and he smiled joyfully as he listened to him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nIt would be difficult to explain why and whither ants whose heap has been destroyed are hurrying: some from the heap dragging bits of rubbish, larvae, and corpses, others back to the heap, or why they jostle, overtake one another, and fight, and it would be equally difficult to explain what caused the Russians after the departure of the French to throng to the place that had formerly been Moscow. But when we watch the ants round their ruined heap, the tenacity, energy, and immense number of the delving insects prove that despite the destruction of the heap, something indestructible, which though intangible is the real strength of the colony, still exists; and similarly, though in Moscow in the month of October there was no government and no churches, shrines, riches, or houses\u2014it was still the Moscow it had been in August. All was destroyed, except something intangible yet powerful and indestructible.\n\nThe motives of those who thronged from all sides to Moscow after it had been cleared of the enemy were most diverse and personal, and at first for the most part savage and brutal. One motive only they all had in common: a desire to get to the place that had been called Moscow, to apply their activities there.\n\nWithin a week Moscow already had fifteen thousand inhabitants, in a fortnight twenty-five thousand, and so on. By the autumn of 1813 the number, ever increasing and increasing, exceeded what it had been in 1812.\n\nThe first Russians to enter Moscow were the Cossacks of Wintzingerode\u2019s detachment, peasants from the adjacent villages, and residents who had fled from Moscow and had been hiding in its vicinity. The Russians who entered Moscow, finding it plundered, plundered it in their turn. They continued what the French had begun. Trains of peasant carts came to Moscow to carry off to the villages what had been abandoned in the ruined houses and the streets. The Cossacks carried off what they could to their camps, and the householders seized all they could find in other houses and moved it to their own, pretending that it was their property.\n\nBut the first plunderers were followed by a second and a third contingent, and with increasing numbers plundering became more and more difficult and assumed more definite forms.\n\nThe French found Moscow abandoned but with all the organizations of regular life, with diverse branches of commerce and craftsmanship, with luxury, and governmental and religious institutions. These forms were lifeless but still existed. There were bazaars, shops, warehouses, market stalls, granaries\u2014for the most part still stocked with goods\u2014and there were factories and workshops, palaces and wealthy houses filled with luxuries, hospitals, prisons, government offices, churches, and cathedrals. The longer the French remained the more these forms of town life perished, until finally all was merged into one confused, lifeless scene of plunder.\n\nThe more the plundering by the French continued, the more both the wealth of Moscow and the strength of its plunderers was destroyed. But plundering by the Russians, with which the reoccupation of the city began, had an opposite effect: the longer it continued and the greater the number of people taking part in it the more rapidly was the wealth of the city and its regular life restored.\n\nBesides the plunderers, very various people, some drawn by curiosity, some by official duties, some by self-interest\u2014house owners, clergy, officials of all kinds, tradesmen, artisans, and peasants\u2014streamed into Moscow as blood flows to the heart.\n\nWithin a week the peasants who came with empty carts to carry off plunder were stopped by the authorities and made to cart the corpses out of the town. Other peasants, having heard of their comrades\u2019 discomfiture, came to town bringing rye, oats, and hay, and beat down one another\u2019s prices to below what they had been in former days. Gangs of carpenters hoping for high pay arrived in Moscow every day, and on all sides logs were being hewn, new houses built, and old, charred ones repaired. Tradesmen began trading in booths. Cookshops and taverns were opened in partially burned houses. The clergy resumed the services in many churches that had not been burned. Donors contributed Church property that had been stolen. Government clerks set up their baize-covered tables and their pigeonholes of documents in small rooms. The higher authorities and the police organized the distribution of goods left behind by the French. The owners of houses in which much property had been left, brought there from other houses, complained of the injustice of taking everything to the Faceted Palace in the Kr\u00e9mlin; others insisted that as the French had gathered things from different houses into this or that house, it would be unfair to allow its owner to keep all that was found there. They abused the police and bribed them, made out estimates at ten times their value for government stores that had perished in the fire, and demanded relief. And Count Rostopch\u00edn wrote proclamations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nAt the end of January Pierre went to Moscow and stayed in an annex of his house which had not been burned. He called on Count Rostopch\u00edn and on some acquaintances who were back in Moscow, and he intended to leave for Petersburg two days later. Everybody was celebrating the victory, everything was bubbling with life in the ruined but reviving city. Everyone was pleased to see Pierre, everyone wished to meet him, and everyone questioned him about what he had seen. Pierre felt particularly well disposed toward them all, but was now instinctively on his guard for fear of binding himself in any way. To all questions put to him\u2014whether important or quite trifling\u2014such as: Where would he live? Was he going to rebuild? When was he going to Petersburg and would he mind taking a parcel for someone?\u2014he replied: \u201cYes, perhaps,\u201d or, \u201cI think so,\u201d and so on.\n\nHe had heard that the Rost\u00f3vs were at Kostrom\u00e1 but the thought of Nat\u00e1sha seldom occurred to him. If it did it was only as a pleasant memory of the distant past. He felt himself not only free from social obligations but also from that feeling which, it seemed to him, he had aroused in himself.\n\nOn the third day after his arrival he heard from the Drubetsk\u00f3ys that Princess Mary was in Moscow. The death, sufferings, and last days of Prince Andrew had often occupied Pierre\u2019s thoughts and now recurred to him with fresh vividness. Having heard at dinner that Princess Mary was in Moscow and living in her house\u2014which had not been burned\u2014in Vozdv\u00edzhenka Street, he drove that same evening to see her.\n\nOn his way to the house Pierre kept thinking of Prince Andrew, of their friendship, of his various meetings with him, and especially of the last one at Borodin\u00f3.\n\n\u201cIs it possible that he died in the bitter frame of mind he was then in? Is it possible that the meaning of life was not disclosed to him before he died?\u201d thought Pierre. He recalled Karat\u00e1ev and his death and involuntarily began to compare these two men, so different, and yet so similar in that they had both lived and both died and in the love he felt for both of them.\n\nPierre drove up to the house of the old prince in a most serious mood. The house had escaped the fire; it showed signs of damage but its general aspect was unchanged. The old footman, who met Pierre with a stern face as if wishing to make the visitor feel that the absence of the old prince had not disturbed the order of things in the house, informed him that the princess had gone to her own apartments, and that she received on Sundays.\n\n\u201cAnnounce me. Perhaps she will see me,\u201d said Pierre.\n\n\u201cYes, sir,\u201d said the man. \u201cPlease step into the portrait gallery.\u201d\n\nA few minutes later the footman returned with Dessalles, who brought word from the princess that she would be very glad to see Pierre if he would excuse her want of ceremony and come upstairs to her apartment.\n\nIn a rather low room lit by one candle sat the princess and with her another person dressed in black. Pierre remembered that the princess always had lady companions, but who they were and what they were like he never knew or remembered. \u201cThis must be one of her companions,\u201d he thought, glancing at the lady in the black dress.\n\nThe princess rose quickly to meet him and held out her hand.\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d she said, looking at his altered face after he had kissed her hand, \u201cso this is how we meet again. He spoke of you even at the very last,\u201d she went on, turning her eyes from Pierre to her companion with a shyness that surprised him for an instant.\n\n\u201cI was so glad to hear of your safety. It was the first piece of good news we had received for a long time.\u201d\n\nAgain the princess glanced round at her companion with even more uneasiness in her manner and was about to add something, but Pierre interrupted her.\n\n\u201cJust imagine\u2014I knew nothing about him!\u201d said he. \u201cI thought he had been killed. All I know I heard at second hand from others. I only know that he fell in with the Rost\u00f3vs.... What a strange coincidence!\u201d\n\nPierre spoke rapidly and with animation. He glanced once at the companion\u2019s face, saw her attentive and kindly gaze fixed on him, and, as often happens when one is talking, felt somehow that this companion in the black dress was a good, kind, excellent creature who would not hinder his conversing freely with Princess Mary.\n\nBut when he mentioned the Rost\u00f3vs, Princess Mary\u2019s face expressed still greater embarrassment. She again glanced rapidly from Pierre\u2019s face to that of the lady in the black dress and said:\n\n\u201cDo you really not recognize her?\u201d\n\nPierre looked again at the companion\u2019s pale, delicate face with its black eyes and peculiar mouth, and something near to him, long forgotten and more than sweet, looked at him from those attentive eyes.\n\n\u201cBut no, it can\u2019t be!\u201d he thought. \u201cThis stern, thin, pale face that looks so much older! It cannot be she. It merely reminds me of her.\u201d But at that moment Princess Mary said, \u201cNat\u00e1sha!\u201d And with difficulty, effort, and stress, like the opening of a door grown rusty on its hinges, a smile appeared on the face with the attentive eyes, and from that opening door came a breath of fragrance which suffused Pierre with a happiness he had long forgotten and of which he had not even been thinking\u2014especially at that moment. It suffused him, seized him, and enveloped him completely. When she smiled doubt was no longer possible, it was Nat\u00e1sha and he loved her.\n\nAt that moment Pierre involuntarily betrayed to her, to Princess Mary, and above all to himself, a secret of which he himself had been unaware. He flushed joyfully yet with painful distress. He tried to hide his agitation. But the more he tried to hide it the more clearly\u2014clearer than any words could have done\u2014did he betray to himself, to her, and to Princess Mary that he loved her.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s only the unexpectedness of it,\u201d thought Pierre. But as soon as he tried to continue the conversation he had begun with Princess Mary he again glanced at Nat\u00e1sha, and a still-deeper flush suffused his face and a still-stronger agitation of mingled joy and fear seized his soul. He became confused in his speech and stopped in the middle of what he was saying.\n\nPierre had failed to notice Nat\u00e1sha because he did not at all expect to see her there, but he had failed to recognize her because the change in her since he last saw her was immense. She had grown thin and pale, but that was not what made her unrecognizable; she was unrecognizable at the moment he entered because on that face whose eyes had always shone with a suppressed smile of the joy of life, now when he first entered and glanced at her there was not the least shadow of a smile: only her eyes were kindly attentive and sadly interrogative.\n\nPierre\u2019s confusion was not reflected by any confusion on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s part, but only by the pleasure that just perceptibly lit up her whole face.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\n\u201cShe has come to stay with me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cThe count and countess will be here in a few days. The countess is in a dreadful state; but it was necessary for Nat\u00e1sha herself to see a doctor. They insisted on her coming with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, is there a family free from sorrow now?\u201d said Pierre, addressing Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou know it happened the very day we were rescued. I saw him. What a delightful boy he was!\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked at him, and by way of answer to his words her eyes widened and lit up.\n\n\u201cWhat can one say or think of as a consolation?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cNothing! Why had such a splendid boy, so full of life, to die?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, in these days it would be hard to live without faith...\u201d remarked Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, that is really true,\u201d Pierre hastily interrupted her.\n\n\u201cWhy is it true?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha asked, looking attentively into Pierre\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cHow can you ask why?\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cThe thought alone of what awaits...\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha without waiting for Princess Mary to finish again looked inquiringly at Pierre.\n\n\u201cAnd because,\u201d Pierre continued, \u201conly one who believes that there is a God ruling us can bear a loss such as hers and... yours.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha had already opened her mouth to speak but suddenly stopped. Pierre hurriedly turned away from her and again addressed Princess Mary, asking about his friend\u2019s last days.\n\nPierre\u2019s confusion had now almost vanished, but at the same time he felt that his freedom had also completely gone. He felt that there was now a judge of his every word and action whose judgment mattered more to him than that of all the rest of the world. As he spoke now he was considering what impression his words would make on Nat\u00e1sha. He did not purposely say things to please her, but whatever he was saying he regarded from her standpoint.\n\nPrincess Mary\u2014reluctantly as is usual in such cases\u2014began telling of the condition in which she had found Prince Andrew. But Pierre\u2019s face quivering with emotion, his questions and his eager restless expression, gradually compelled her to go into details which she feared to recall for her own sake.\n\n\u201cYes, yes, and so...?\u201d Pierre kept saying as he leaned toward her with his whole body and eagerly listened to her story. \u201cYes, yes... so he grew tranquil and softened? With all his soul he had always sought one thing\u2014to be perfectly good\u2014so he could not be afraid of death. The faults he had\u2014if he had any\u2014were not of his making. So he did soften?... What a happy thing that he saw you again,\u201d he added, suddenly turning to Nat\u00e1sha and looking at her with eyes full of tears.\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s face twitched. She frowned and lowered her eyes for a moment. She hesitated for an instant whether to speak or not.\n\n\u201cYes, that was happiness,\u201d she then said in her quiet voice with its deep chest notes. \u201cFor me it certainly was happiness.\u201d She paused. \u201cAnd he... he... he said he was wishing for it at the very moment I entered the room....\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s voice broke. She blushed, pressed her clasped hands on her knees, and then controlling herself with an evident effort lifted her head and began to speak rapidly.\n\n\u201cWe knew nothing of it when we started from Moscow. I did not dare to ask about him. Then suddenly S\u00f3nya told me he was traveling with us. I had no idea and could not imagine what state he was in, all I wanted was to see him and be with him,\u201d she said, trembling, and breathing quickly.\n\nAnd not letting them interrupt her she went on to tell what she had never yet mentioned to anyone\u2014all she had lived through during those three weeks of their journey and life at Yarosl\u00e1vl.\n\nPierre listened to her with lips parted and eyes fixed upon her full of tears. As he listened he did not think of Prince Andrew, nor of death, nor of what she was telling. He listened to her and felt only pity for her, for what she was suffering now while she was speaking.\n\nPrincess Mary, frowning in her effort to hold back her tears, sat beside Nat\u00e1sha, and heard for the first time the story of those last days of her brother\u2019s and Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s love.\n\nEvidently Nat\u00e1sha needed to tell that painful yet joyful tale.\n\nShe spoke, mingling most trifling details with the intimate secrets of her soul, and it seemed as if she could never finish. Several times she repeated the same thing twice.\n\nDessalles\u2019 voice was heard outside the door asking whether little Nicholas might come in to say good night.\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s all\u2014everything,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nShe got up quickly just as Nicholas entered, almost ran to the door which was hidden by curtains, struck her head against it, and rushed from the room with a moan either of pain or sorrow.\n\nPierre gazed at the door through which she had disappeared and did not understand why he suddenly felt all alone in the world.\n\nPrincess Mary roused him from his abstraction by drawing his attention to her nephew who had entered the room.\n\nAt that moment of emotional tenderness young Nicholas\u2019 face, which resembled his father\u2019s, affected Pierre so much that when he had kissed the boy he got up quickly, took out his handkerchief, and went to the window. He wished to take leave of Princess Mary, but she would not let him go.\n\n\u201cNo, Nat\u00e1sha and I sometimes don\u2019t go to sleep till after two, so please don\u2019t go. I will order supper. Go downstairs, we will come immediately.\u201d\n\nBefore Pierre left the room Princess Mary told him: \u201cThis is the first time she has talked of him like that.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVII\n\nPierre was shown into the large, brightly lit dining room; a few minutes later he heard footsteps and Princess Mary entered with Nat\u00e1sha. Nat\u00e1sha was calm, though a severe and grave expression had again settled on her face. They all three of them now experienced that feeling of awkwardness which usually follows after a serious and heartfelt talk. It is impossible to go back to the same conversation, to talk of trifles is awkward, and yet the desire to speak is there and silence seems like affectation. They went silently to table. The footmen drew back the chairs and pushed them up again. Pierre unfolded his cold table napkin and, resolving to break the silence, looked at Nat\u00e1sha and at Princess Mary. They had evidently both formed the same resolution; the eyes of both shone with satisfaction and a confession that besides sorrow life also has joy.\n\n\u201cDo you take vodka, Count?\u201d asked Princess Mary, and those words suddenly banished the shadows of the past. \u201cNow tell us about yourself,\u201d said she. \u201cOne hears such improbable wonders about you.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Pierre with the smile of mild irony now habitual to him. \u201cThey even tell me wonders I myself never dreamed of! Mary Abr\u00e1movna invited me to her house and kept telling me what had happened, or ought to have happened, to me. Step\u00e1n Step\u00e1nych also instructed me how I ought to tell of my experiences. In general I have noticed that it is very easy to be an interesting man (I am an interesting man now); people invite me out and tell me all about myself.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha smiled and was on the point of speaking.\n\n\u201cWe have been told,\u201d Princess Mary interrupted her, \u201cthat you lost two millions in Moscow. Is that true?\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am three times as rich as before,\u201d returned Pierre.\n\nThough the position was now altered by his decision to pay his wife\u2019s debts and to rebuild his houses, Pierre still maintained that he had become three times as rich as before.\n\n\u201cWhat I have certainly gained is freedom,\u201d he began seriously, but did not continue, noticing that this theme was too egotistic.\n\n\u201cAnd are you building?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes. Sav\u00e9lich says I must!\u201d\n\n\u201cTell me, you did not know of the countess\u2019 death when you decided to remain in Moscow?\u201d asked Princess Mary and immediately blushed, noticing that her question, following his mention of freedom, ascribed to his words a meaning he had perhaps not intended.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered Pierre, evidently not considering awkward the meaning Princess Mary had given to his words. \u201cI heard of it in Or\u00ebl and you cannot imagine how it shocked me. We were not an exemplary couple,\u201d he added quickly, glancing at Nat\u00e1sha and noticing on her face curiosity as to how he would speak of his wife, \u201cbut her death shocked me terribly. When two people quarrel they are always both in fault, and one\u2019s own guilt suddenly becomes terribly serious when the other is no longer alive. And then such a death... without friends and without consolation! I am very, very sorry for her,\u201d he concluded, and was pleased to notice a look of glad approval on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cYes, and so you are once more an eligible bachelor,\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nPierre suddenly flushed crimson and for a long time tried not to look at Nat\u00e1sha. When he ventured to glance her way again her face was cold, stern, and he fancied even contemptuous.\n\n\u201cAnd did you really see and speak to Napoleon, as we have been told?\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\nPierre laughed.\n\n\u201cNo, not once! Everybody seems to imagine that being taken prisoner means being Napoleon\u2019s guest. Not only did I never see him but I heard nothing about him\u2014I was in much lower company!\u201d\n\nSupper was over, and Pierre who at first declined to speak about his captivity was gradually led on to do so.\n\n\u201cBut it\u2019s true that you remained in Moscow to kill Napoleon?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha asked with a slight smile. \u201cI guessed it then when we met at the S\u00fakharev tower, do you remember?\u201d\n\nPierre admitted that it was true, and from that was gradually led by Princess Mary\u2019s questions and especially by Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s into giving a detailed account of his adventures.\n\nAt first he spoke with the amused and mild irony now customary with him toward everybody and especially toward himself, but when he came to describe the horrors and sufferings he had witnessed he was unconsciously carried away and began speaking with the suppressed emotion of a man re-experiencing in recollection strong impressions he has lived through.\n\nPrincess Mary with a gentle smile looked now at Pierre and now at Nat\u00e1sha. In the whole narrative she saw only Pierre and his goodness. Nat\u00e1sha, leaning on her elbow, the expression of her face constantly changing with the narrative, watched Pierre with an attention that never wandered\u2014evidently herself experiencing all that he described. Not only her look, but her exclamations and the brief questions she put, showed Pierre that she understood just what he wished to convey. It was clear that she understood not only what he said but also what he wished to, but could not, express in words. The account Pierre gave of the incident with the child and the woman for protecting whom he was arrested was this: \u201cIt was an awful sight\u2014children abandoned, some in the flames... One was snatched out before my eyes... and there were women who had their things snatched off and their earrings torn out...\u201d he flushed and grew confused. \u201cThen a patrol arrived and all the men\u2014all those who were not looting, that is\u2014were arrested, and I among them.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure you\u2019re not telling us everything; I am sure you did something...\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha and pausing added, \u201csomething fine?\u201d\n\nPierre continued. When he spoke of the execution he wanted to pass over the horrible details, but Nat\u00e1sha insisted that he should not omit anything.\n\nPierre began to tell about Karat\u00e1ev, but paused. By this time he had risen from the table and was pacing the room, Nat\u00e1sha following him with her eyes. Then he added:\n\n\u201cNo, you can\u2019t understand what I learned from that illiterate man\u2014that simple fellow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, yes, go on!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey killed him almost before my eyes.\u201d\n\nAnd Pierre, his voice trembling continually, went on to tell of the last days of their retreat, of Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s illness and his death.\n\nHe told of his adventures as he had never yet recalled them. He now, as it were, saw a new meaning in all he had gone through. Now that he was telling it all to Nat\u00e1sha he experienced that pleasure which a man has when women listen to him\u2014not clever women who when listening either try to remember what they hear to enrich their minds and when opportunity offers to retell it, or who wish to adopt it to some thought of their own and promptly contribute their own clever comments prepared in their little mental workshop\u2014but the pleasure given by real women gifted with a capacity to select and absorb the very best a man shows of himself. Nat\u00e1sha without knowing it was all attention: she did not lose a word, no single quiver in Pierre\u2019s voice, no look, no twitch of a muscle in his face, nor a single gesture. She caught the unfinished word in its flight and took it straight into her open heart, divining the secret meaning of all Pierre\u2019s mental travail.\n\nPrincess Mary understood his story and sympathized with him, but she now saw something else that absorbed all her attention. She saw the possibility of love and happiness between Nat\u00e1sha and Pierre, and the first thought of this filled her heart with gladness.\n\nIt was three o\u2019clock in the morning. The footmen came in with sad and stern faces to change the candles, but no one noticed them.\n\nPierre finished his story. Nat\u00e1sha continued to look at him intently with bright, attentive, and animated eyes, as if trying to understand something more which he had perhaps left untold. Pierre in shamefaced and happy confusion glanced occasionally at her, and tried to think what to say next to introduce a fresh subject. Princess Mary was silent. It occurred to none of them that it was three o\u2019clock and time to go to bed.\n\n\u201cPeople speak of misfortunes and sufferings,\u201d remarked Pierre, \u201cbut if at this moment I were asked: \u2018Would you rather be what you were before you were taken prisoner, or go through all this again?\u2019 then for heaven\u2019s sake let me again have captivity and horseflesh! We imagine that when we are thrown out of our usual ruts all is lost, but it is only then that what is new and good begins. While there is life there is happiness. There is much, much before us. I say this to you,\u201d he added, turning to Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d she said, answering something quite different. \u201cI too should wish nothing but to relive it all from the beginning.\u201d\n\nPierre looked intently at her.\n\n\u201cYes, and nothing more,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not true, not true!\u201d cried Pierre. \u201cI am not to blame for being alive and wishing to live\u2014nor you either.\u201d\n\nSuddenly Nat\u00e1sha bent her head, covered her face with her hands, and began to cry.\n\n\u201cWhat is it, Nat\u00e1sha?\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cNothing, nothing.\u201d She smiled at Pierre through her tears. \u201cGood night! It is time for bed.\u201d\n\nPierre rose and took his leave.\n\n\nPrincess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha met as usual in the bedroom. They talked of what Pierre had told them. Princess Mary did not express her opinion of Pierre nor did Nat\u00e1sha speak of him.\n\n\u201cWell, good night, Mary!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cDo you know, I am often afraid that by not speaking of him\u201d (she meant Prince Andrew) \u201cfor fear of not doing justice to our feelings, we forget him.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary sighed deeply and thereby acknowledged the justice of Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s remark, but she did not express agreement in words.\n\n\u201cIs it possible to forget?\u201d said she.\n\n\u201cIt did me so much good to tell all about it today. It was hard and painful, but good, very good!\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cI am sure he really loved him. That is why I told him... Was it all right?\u201d she added, suddenly blushing.\n\n\u201cTo tell Pierre? Oh, yes. What a splendid man he is!\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cDo you know, Mary...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly said with a mischievous smile such as Princess Mary had not seen on her face for a long time, \u201che has somehow grown so clean, smooth, and fresh\u2014as if he had just come out of a Russian bath; do you understand? Out of a moral bath. Isn\u2019t it true?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d replied Princess Mary. \u201cHe has greatly improved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith a short coat and his hair cropped; just as if, well, just as if he had come straight from the bath... Papa used to...\u201d\n\n\u201cI understand why he\u201d (Prince Andrew) \u201cliked no one so much as him,\u201d said Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cYes, and yet he is quite different. They say men are friends when they are quite different. That must be true. Really he is quite unlike him\u2014in everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but he\u2019s wonderful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, good night,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nAnd the same mischievous smile lingered for a long time on her face as if it had been forgotten there.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVIII\nIt was a long time before Pierre could fall asleep that night. He paced up and down his room, now turning his thoughts on a difficult problem and frowning, now suddenly shrugging his shoulders and wincing, and now smiling happily.\n\nHe was thinking of Prince Andrew, of Nat\u00e1sha, and of their love, at one moment jealous of her past, then reproaching himself for that feeling. It was already six in the morning and he still paced up and down the room.\n\n\u201cWell, what\u2019s to be done if it cannot be avoided? What\u2019s to be done? Evidently it has to be so,\u201d said he to himself, and hastily undressing he got into bed, happy and agitated but free from hesitation or indecision.\n\n\u201cStrange and impossible as such happiness seems, I must do everything that she and I may be man and wife,\u201d he told himself.\n\nA few days previously Pierre had decided to go to Petersburg on the Friday. When he awoke on the Thursday, Sav\u00e9lich came to ask him about packing for the journey.\n\n\u201cWhat, to Petersburg? What is Petersburg? Who is there in Petersburg?\u201d he asked involuntarily, though only to himself. \u201cOh, yes, long ago before this happened I did for some reason mean to go to Petersburg,\u201d he reflected. \u201cWhy? But perhaps I shall go. What a good fellow he is and how attentive, and how he remembers everything,\u201d he thought, looking at Sav\u00e9lich\u2019s old face, \u201cand what a pleasant smile he has!\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, Sav\u00e9lich, do you still not wish to accept your freedom?\u201d Pierre asked him.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s the good of freedom to me, your excellency? We lived under the late count\u2014the kingdom of heaven be his!\u2014and we have lived under you too, without ever being wronged.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd your children?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe children will live just the same. With such masters one can live.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut what about my heirs?\u201d said Pierre. \u201cSupposing I suddenly marry... it might happen,\u201d he added with an involuntary smile.\n\n\u201cIf I may take the liberty, your excellency, it would be a good thing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow easy he thinks it,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how terrible it is and how dangerous. Too soon or too late... it is terrible!\u201d\n\n\u201cSo what are your orders? Are you starting tomorrow?\u201d asked Sav\u00e9lich.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019ll put it off for a bit. I\u2019ll tell you later. You must forgive the trouble I have put you to,\u201d said Pierre, and seeing Sav\u00e9lich smile, he thought: \u201cBut how strange it is that he should not know that now there is no Petersburg for me, and that that must be settled first of all! But probably he knows it well enough and is only pretending. Shall I have a talk with him and see what he thinks?\u201d Pierre reflected. \u201cNo, another time.\u201d\n\nAt breakfast Pierre told the princess, his cousin, that he had been to see Princess Mary the day before and had there met\u2014\u201cWhom do you think? Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va!\u201d\n\nThe princess seemed to see nothing more extraordinary in that than if he had seen Anna Sem\u00ebnovna.\n\n\u201cDo you know her?\u201d asked Pierre.\n\n\u201cI have seen the princess,\u201d she replied. \u201cI heard that they were arranging a match for her with young Rost\u00f3v. It would be a very good thing for the Rost\u00f3vs, they are said to be utterly ruined.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo; I mean do you know Nat\u00e1sha Rost\u00f3va?\u201d\n\n\u201cI heard about that affair of hers at the time. It was a great pity.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, she either doesn\u2019t understand or is pretending,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cBetter not say anything to her either.\u201d\n\nThe princess too had prepared provisions for Pierre\u2019s journey.\n\n\u201cHow kind they all are,\u201d thought Pierre. \u201cWhat is surprising is that they should trouble about these things now when it can no longer be of interest to them. And all for me!\u201d\n\nOn the same day the Chief of Police came to Pierre, inviting him to send a representative to the Faceted Palace to recover things that were to be returned to their owners that day.\n\n\u201cAnd this man too,\u201d thought Pierre, looking into the face of the Chief of Police. \u201cWhat a fine, good-looking officer and how kind. Fancy bothering about such trifles now! And they actually say he is not honest and takes bribes. What nonsense! Besides, why shouldn\u2019t he take bribes? That\u2019s the way he was brought up, and everybody does it. But what a kind, pleasant face and how he smiles as he looks at me.\u201d\n\nPierre went to Princess Mary\u2019s to dinner.\n\nAs he drove through the streets past the houses that had been burned down, he was surprised by the beauty of those ruins. The picturesqueness of the chimney stacks and tumble-down walls of the burned-out quarters of the town, stretching out and concealing one another, reminded him of the Rhine and the Colosseum. The cabmen he met and their passengers, the carpenters cutting the timber for new houses with axes, the women hawkers, and the shopkeepers, all looked at him with cheerful beaming eyes that seemed to say: \u201cAh, there he is! Let\u2019s see what will come of it!\u201d\n\nAt the entrance to Princess Mary\u2019s house Pierre felt doubtful whether he had really been there the night before and really seen Nat\u00e1sha and talked to her. \u201cPerhaps I imagined it; perhaps I shall go in and find no one there.\u201d But he had hardly entered the room before he felt her presence with his whole being by the loss of his sense of freedom. She was in the same black dress with soft folds and her hair was done the same way as the day before, yet she was quite different. Had she been like this when he entered the day before he could not for a moment have failed to recognize her.\n\nShe was as he had known her almost as a child and later on as Prince Andrew\u2019s fianc\u00e9e. A bright questioning light shone in her eyes, and on her face was a friendly and strangely roguish expression.\n\nPierre dined with them and would have spent the whole evening there, but Princess Mary was going to vespers and Pierre left the house with her.\n\nNext day he came early, dined, and stayed the whole evening. Though Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha were evidently glad to see their visitor and though all Pierre\u2019s interest was now centered in that house, by the evening they had talked over everything and the conversation passed from one trivial topic to another and repeatedly broke off. He stayed so long that Princess Mary and Nat\u00e1sha exchanged glances, evidently wondering when he would go. Pierre noticed this but could not go. He felt uneasy and embarrassed, but sat on because he simply could not get up and take his leave.\n\nPrincess Mary, foreseeing no end to this, rose first, and complaining of a headache began to say good night.\n\n\u201cSo you are going to Petersburg tomorrow?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cNo, I am not going,\u201d Pierre replied hastily, in a surprised tone and as though offended. \u201cYes... no... to Petersburg? Tomorrow\u2014but I won\u2019t say good-by yet. I will call round in case you have any commissions for me,\u201d said he, standing before Princess Mary and turning red, but not taking his departure.\n\nNat\u00e1sha gave him her hand and went out. Princess Mary on the other hand instead of going away sank into an armchair, and looked sternly and intently at him with her deep, radiant eyes. The weariness she had plainly shown before had now quite passed off. With a deep and long-drawn sigh she seemed to be prepared for a lengthy talk.\n\nWhen Nat\u00e1sha left the room Pierre\u2019s confusion and awkwardness immediately vanished and were replaced by eager excitement. He quickly moved an armchair toward Princess Mary.\n\n\u201cYes, I wanted to tell you,\u201d said he, answering her look as if she had spoken. \u201cPrincess, help me! What am I to do? Can I hope? Princess, my dear friend, listen! I know it all. I know I am not worthy of her, I know it\u2019s impossible to speak of it now. But I want to be a brother to her. No, not that, I don\u2019t, I can\u2019t...\u201d\n\nHe paused and rubbed his face and eyes with his hands.\n\n\u201cWell,\u201d he went on with an evident effort at self-control and coherence. \u201cI don\u2019t know when I began to love her, but I have loved her and her alone all my life, and I love her so that I cannot imagine life without her. I cannot propose to her at present, but the thought that perhaps she might someday be my wife and that I may be missing that possibility... that possibility... is terrible. Tell me, can I hope? Tell me what I am to do, dear princess!\u201d he added after a pause, and touched her hand as she did not reply.\n\n\u201cI am thinking of what you have told me,\u201d answered Princess Mary. \u201cThis is what I will say. You are right that to speak to her of love at present...\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary stopped. She was going to say that to speak of love was impossible, but she stopped because she had seen by the sudden change in Nat\u00e1sha two days before that she would not only not be hurt if Pierre spoke of his love, but that it was the very thing she wished for.\n\n\u201cTo speak to her now wouldn\u2019t do,\u201d said the princess all the same.\n\n\u201cBut what am I to do?\u201d\n\n\u201cLeave it to me,\u201d said Princess Mary. \u201cI know...\u201d\n\nPierre was looking into Princess Mary\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cWell?... Well?...\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI know that she loves... will love you,\u201d Princess Mary corrected herself.\n\nBefore her words were out, Pierre had sprung up and with a frightened expression seized Princess Mary\u2019s hand.\n\n\u201cWhat makes you think so? You think I may hope? You think...?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d said Princess Mary with a smile. \u201cWrite to her parents, and leave it to me. I will tell her when I can. I wish it to happen and my heart tells me it will.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, it cannot be! How happy I am! But it can\u2019t be.... How happy I am! No, it can\u2019t be!\u201d Pierre kept saying as he kissed Princess Mary\u2019s hands.\n\n\u201cGo to Petersburg, that will be best. And I will write to you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cTo Petersburg? Go there? Very well, I\u2019ll go. But I may come again tomorrow?\u201d\n\nNext day Pierre came to say good-by. Nat\u00e1sha was less animated than she had been the day before; but that day as he looked at her Pierre sometimes felt as if he was vanishing and that neither he nor she existed any longer, that nothing existed but happiness. \u201cIs it possible? No, it can\u2019t be,\u201d he told himself at every look, gesture, and word that filled his soul with joy.\n\nWhen on saying good-by he took her thin, slender hand, he could not help holding it a little longer in his own.\n\n\u201cIs it possible that this hand, that face, those eyes, all this treasure of feminine charm so strange to me now, is it possible that it will one day be mine forever, as familiar to me as I am to myself?... No, that\u2019s impossible!...\u201d\n\n\u201cGood-by, Count,\u201d she said aloud. \u201cI shall look forward very much to your return,\u201d she added in a whisper.\n\nAnd these simple words, her look, and the expression on her face which accompanied them, formed for two months the subject of inexhaustible memories, interpretations, and happy meditations for Pierre. \u201c\u2018I shall look forward very much to your return....\u2019 Yes, yes, how did she say it? Yes, \u2018I shall look forward very much to your return.\u2019 Oh, how happy I am! What is happening to me? How happy I am!\u201d said Pierre to himself.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIX\n\nThere was nothing in Pierre\u2019s soul now at all like what had troubled it during his courtship of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne.\n\nHe did not repeat to himself with a sickening feeling of shame the words he had spoken, or say: \u201cOh, why did I not say that?\u201d and, \u201cWhatever made me say \u2018Je vous aime\u2019?\u201d On the contrary, he now repeated in imagination every word that he or Nat\u00e1sha had spoken and pictured every detail of her face and smile, and did not wish to diminish or add anything, but only to repeat it again and again. There was now not a shadow of doubt in his mind as to whether what he had undertaken was right or wrong. Only one terrible doubt sometimes crossed his mind: \u201cWasn\u2019t it all a dream? Isn\u2019t Princess Mary mistaken? Am I not too conceited and self-confident? I believe all this\u2014and suddenly Princess Mary will tell her, and she will be sure to smile and say: \u2018How strange! He must be deluding himself. Doesn\u2019t he know that he is a man, just a man, while I...? I am something altogether different and higher.\u2019\u201d\n\nThat was the only doubt often troubling Pierre. He did not now make any plans. The happiness before him appeared so inconceivable that if only he could attain it, it would be the end of all things. Everything ended with that.\n\nA joyful, unexpected frenzy, of which he had thought himself incapable, possessed him. The whole meaning of life\u2014not for him alone but for the whole world\u2014seemed to him centered in his love and the possibility of being loved by her. At times everybody seemed to him to be occupied with one thing only\u2014his future happiness. Sometimes it seemed to him that other people were all as pleased as he was himself and merely tried to hide that pleasure by pretending to be busy with other interests. In every word and gesture he saw allusions to his happiness. He often surprised those he met by his significantly happy looks and smiles which seemed to express a secret understanding between him and them. And when he realized that people might not be aware of his happiness, he pitied them with his whole heart and felt a desire somehow to explain to them that all that occupied them was a mere frivolous trifle unworthy of attention.\n\nWhen it was suggested to him that he should enter the civil service, or when the war or any general political affairs were discussed on the assumption that everybody\u2019s welfare depended on this or that issue of events, he would listen with a mild and pitying smile and surprise people by his strange comments. But at this time he saw everybody\u2014both those who, as he imagined, understood the real meaning of life (that is, what he was feeling) and those unfortunates who evidently did not understand it\u2014in the bright light of the emotion that shone within himself, and at once without any effort saw in everyone he met everything that was good and worthy of being loved.\n\nWhen dealing with the affairs and papers of his dead wife, her memory aroused in him no feeling but pity that she had not known the bliss he now knew. Prince Vas\u00edli, who having obtained a new post and some fresh decorations was particularly proud at this time, seemed to him a pathetic, kindly old man much to be pitied.\n\nOften in afterlife Pierre recalled this period of blissful insanity. All the views he formed of men and circumstances at this time remained true for him always. He not only did not renounce them subsequently, but when he was in doubt or inwardly at variance, he referred to the views he had held at this time of his madness and they always proved correct.\n\n\u201cI may have appeared strange and queer then,\u201d he thought, \u201cbut I was not so mad as I seemed. On the contrary I was then wiser and had more insight than at any other time, and understood all that is worth understanding in life, because... because I was happy.\u201d\n\nPierre\u2019s insanity consisted in not waiting, as he used to do, to discover personal attributes which he termed \u201cgood qualities\u201d in people before loving them; his heart was now overflowing with love, and by loving people without cause he discovered indubitable causes for loving them.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XX\n\nAfter Pierre\u2019s departure that first evening, when Nat\u00e1sha had said to Princess Mary with a gaily mocking smile: \u201cHe looks just, yes, just as if he had come out of a Russian bath\u2014in a short coat and with his hair cropped,\u201d something hidden and unknown to herself, but irrepressible, awoke in Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s soul.\n\nEverything: her face, walk, look, and voice, was suddenly altered. To her own surprise a power of life and hope of happiness rose to the surface and demanded satisfaction. From that evening she seemed to have forgotten all that had happened to her. She no longer complained of her position, did not say a word about the past, and no longer feared to make happy plans for the future. She spoke little of Pierre, but when Princess Mary mentioned him a long-extinguished light once more kindled in her eyes and her lips curved with a strange smile.\n\nThe change that took place in Nat\u00e1sha at first surprised Princess Mary; but when she understood its meaning it grieved her. \u201cCan she have loved my brother so little as to be able to forget him so soon?\u201d she thought when she reflected on the change. But when she was with Nat\u00e1sha she was not vexed with her and did not reproach her. The reawakened power of life that had seized Nat\u00e1sha was so evidently irrepressible and unexpected by her that in her presence Princess Mary felt that she had no right to reproach her even in her heart.\n\nNat\u00e1sha gave herself up so fully and frankly to this new feeling that she did not try to hide the fact that she was no longer sad, but bright and cheerful.\n\nWhen Princess Mary returned to her room after her nocturnal talk with Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha met her on the threshold.\n\n\u201cHe has spoken? Yes? He has spoken?\u201d she repeated.\n\nAnd a joyful yet pathetic expression which seemed to beg forgiveness for her joy settled on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face.\n\n\u201cI wanted to listen at the door, but I knew you would tell me.\u201d\n\nUnderstandable and touching as the look with which Nat\u00e1sha gazed at her seemed to Princess Mary, and sorry as she was to see her agitation, these words pained her for a moment. She remembered her brother and his love.\n\n\u201cBut what\u2019s to be done? She can\u2019t help it,\u201d thought the princess.\n\nAnd with a sad and rather stern look she told Nat\u00e1sha all that Pierre had said. On hearing that he was going to Petersburg Nat\u00e1sha was astounded.\n\n\u201cTo Petersburg!\u201d she repeated as if unable to understand.\n\nBut noticing the grieved expression on Princess Mary\u2019s face she guessed the reason of that sadness and suddenly began to cry.\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d said she, \u201ctell me what I should do! I am afraid of being bad. Whatever you tell me, I will do. Tell me....\u201d\n\n\u201cYou love him?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d whispered Nat\u00e1sha.\n\n\u201cThen why are you crying? I am happy for your sake,\u201d said Princess Mary, who because of those tears quite forgave Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s joy.\n\n\u201cIt won\u2019t be just yet\u2014someday. Think what fun it will be when I am his wife and you marry Nicholas!\u201d\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, I have asked you not to speak of that. Let us talk about you.\u201d\n\nThey were silent awhile.\n\n\u201cBut why go to Petersburg?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly asked, and hastily replied to her own question. \u201cBut no, no, he must... Yes, Mary, He must....\u201d\n\n\n\nFIRST EPILOGUE: 1813 - 20\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nSeven years had passed. The storm-tossed sea of European history had subsided within its shores and seemed to have become calm. But the mysterious forces that move humanity (mysterious because the laws of their motion are unknown to us) continued to operate.\n\nThough the surface of the sea of history seemed motionless, the movement of humanity went on as unceasingly as the flow of time. Various groups of people formed and dissolved, the coming formation and dissolution of kingdoms and displacement of peoples was in course of preparation.\n\nThe sea of history was not driven spasmodically from shore to shore as previously. It was seething in its depths. Historic figures were not borne by the waves from one shore to another as before. They now seemed to rotate on one spot. The historical figures at the head of armies, who formerly reflected the movement of the masses by ordering wars, campaigns, and battles, now reflected the restless movement by political and diplomatic combinations, laws, and treaties.\n\nThe historians call this activity of the historical figures \u201cthe reaction.\u201d\n\nIn dealing with this period they sternly condemn the historical personages who, in their opinion, caused what they describe as the reaction. All the well-known people of that period, from Alexander and Napoleon to Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Photius, Schelling, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and the rest, pass before their stern judgment seat and are acquitted or condemned according to whether they conduced to progress or to reaction.\n\nAccording to their accounts a reaction took place at that time in Russia also, and the chief culprit was Alexander I, the same man who according to them was the chief cause of the liberal movement at the commencement of his reign, being the savior of Russia.\n\nThere is no one in Russian literature now, from schoolboy essayist to learned historian, who does not throw his little stone at Alexander for things he did wrong at this period of his reign.\n\n\u201cHe ought to have acted in this way and in that way. In this case he did well and in that case badly. He behaved admirably at the beginning of his reign and during 1812, but acted badly by giving a constitution to Poland, forming the Holy Alliance, entrusting power to Arakch\u00e9ev, favoring Gol\u00edtsyn and mysticism, and afterwards Shishk\u00f3v and Photius. He also acted badly by concerning himself with the active army and disbanding the Sem\u00ebnov regiment.\u201d\n\nIt would take a dozen pages to enumerate all the reproaches the historians address to him, based on their knowledge of what is good for humanity.\n\nWhat do these reproaches mean?\n\nDo not the very actions for which the historians praise Alexander I (the liberal attempts at the beginning of his reign, his struggle with Napoleon, the firmness he displayed in 1812 and the campaign of 1813) flow from the same sources\u2014the circumstances of his birth, education, and life\u2014that made his personality what it was and from which the actions for which they blame him (the Holy Alliance, the restoration of Poland, and the reaction of 1820 and later) also flowed?\n\nIn what does the substance of those reproaches lie?\n\nIt lies in the fact that an historic character like Alexander I, standing on the highest possible pinnacle of human power with the blinding light of history focused upon him; a character exposed to those strongest of all influences: the intrigues, flattery, and self-deception inseparable from power; a character who at every moment of his life felt a responsibility for all that was happening in Europe; and not a fictitious but a live character who like every man had his personal habits, passions, and impulses toward goodness, beauty, and truth\u2014that this character\u2014though not lacking in virtue (the historians do not accuse him of that)\u2014had not the same conception of the welfare of humanity fifty years ago as a present-day professor who from his youth upwards has been occupied with learning: that is, with books and lectures and with taking notes from them.\n\nBut even if we assume that fifty years ago Alexander I was mistaken in his view of what was good for the people, we must inevitably assume that the historian who judges Alexander will also after the lapse of some time turn out to be mistaken in his view of what is good for humanity. This assumption is all the more natural and inevitable because, watching the movement of history, we see that every year and with each new writer, opinion as to what is good for mankind changes; so that what once seemed good, ten years later seems bad, and vice versa. And what is more, we find at one and the same time quite contradictory views as to what is bad and what is good in history: some people regard giving a constitution to Poland and forming the Holy Alliance as praiseworthy in Alexander, while others regard it as blameworthy.\n\nThe activity of Alexander or of Napoleon cannot be called useful or harmful, for it is impossible to say for what it was useful or harmful. If that activity displeases somebody, this is only because it does not agree with his limited understanding of what is good. Whether the preservation of my father\u2019s house in Moscow, or the glory of the Russian arms, or the prosperity of the Petersburg and other universities, or the freedom of Poland or the greatness of Russia, or the balance of power in Europe, or a certain kind of European culture called \u201cprogress\u201d appear to me to be good or bad, I must admit that besides these things the action of every historic character has other more general purposes inaccessible to me.\n\nBut let us assume that what is called science can harmonize all contradictions and possesses an unchanging standard of good and bad by which to try historic characters and events; let us say that Alexander could have done everything differently; let us say that with guidance from those who blame him and who profess to know the ultimate aim of the movement of humanity, he might have arranged matters according to the program his present accusers would have given him\u2014of nationality, freedom, equality, and progress (these, I think, cover the ground). Let us assume that this program was possible and had then been formulated, and that Alexander had acted on it. What would then have become of the activity of all those who opposed the tendency that then prevailed in the government\u2014an activity that in the opinion of the historians was good and beneficent? Their activity would not have existed: there would have been no life, there would have been nothing.\n\nIf we admit that human life can be ruled by reason, the possibility of life is destroyed.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nIf we assume as the historians do that great men lead humanity to the attainment of certain ends\u2014the greatness of Russia or of France, the balance of power in Europe, the diffusion of the ideas of the Revolution, general progress, or anything else\u2014then it is impossible to explain the facts of history without introducing the conceptions of chance and genius.\n\nIf the aim of the European wars at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been the aggrandizement of Russia, that aim might have been accomplished without all the preceding wars and without the invasion. If the aim was the aggrandizement of France, that might have been attained without the Revolution and without the Empire. If the aim was the dissemination of ideas, the printing press could have accomplished that much better than warfare. If the aim was the progress of civilization, it is easy to see that there are other ways of diffusing civilization more expedient than by the destruction of wealth and of human lives.\n\nWhy did it happen in this and not in some other way?\n\nBecause it happened so! \u201cChance created the situation; genius utilized it,\u201d says history.\n\nBut what is chance? What is genius?\n\nThe words chance and genius do not denote any really existing thing and therefore cannot be defined. Those words only denote a certain stage of understanding of phenomena. I do not know why a certain event occurs; I think that I cannot know it; so I do not try to know it and I talk about chance. I see a force producing effects beyond the scope of ordinary human agencies; I do not understand why this occurs and I talk of genius.\n\nTo a herd of rams, the ram the herdsman drives each evening into a special enclosure to feed and that becomes twice as fat as the others must seem to be a genius. And it must appear an astonishing conjunction of genius with a whole series of extraordinary chances that this ram, who instead of getting into the general fold every evening goes into a special enclosure where there are oats\u2014that this very ram, swelling with fat, is killed for meat.\n\nBut the rams need only cease to suppose that all that happens to them happens solely for the attainment of their sheepish aims; they need only admit that what happens to them may also have purposes beyond their ken, and they will at once perceive a unity and coherence in what happened to the ram that was fattened. Even if they do not know for what purpose they are fattened, they will at least know that all that happened to the ram did not happen accidentally, and will no longer need the conceptions of chance or genius.\n\nOnly by renouncing our claim to discern a purpose immediately intelligible to us, and admitting the ultimate purpose to be beyond our ken, may we discern the sequence of experiences in the lives of historic characters and perceive the cause of the effect they produce (incommensurable with ordinary human capabilities), and then the words chance and genius become superfluous.\n\nWe need only confess that we do not know the purpose of the European convulsions and that we know only the facts\u2014that is, the murders, first in France, then in Italy, in Africa, in Prussia, in Austria, in Spain, and in Russia\u2014and that the movements from the west to the east and from the east to the west form the essence and purpose of these events, and not only shall we have no need to see exceptional ability and genius in Napoleon and Alexander, but we shall be unable to consider them to be anything but like other men, and we shall not be obliged to have recourse to chance for an explanation of those small events which made these people what they were, but it will be clear that all those small events were inevitable.\n\nBy discarding a claim to knowledge of the ultimate purpose, we shall clearly perceive that just as one cannot imagine a blossom or seed for any single plant better suited to it than those it produces, so it is impossible to imagine any two people more completely adapted down to the smallest detail for the purpose they had to fulfill, than Napoleon and Alexander with all their antecedents.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nThe fundamental and essential significance of the European events of the beginning of the nineteenth century lies in the movement of the mass of the European peoples from west to east and afterwards from east to west. The commencement of that movement was the movement from west to east. For the peoples of the west to be able to make their warlike movement to Moscow it was necessary: (1) that they should form themselves into a military group of a size able to endure a collision with the warlike military group of the east, (2) that they should abandon all established traditions and customs, and (3) that during their military movement they should have at their head a man who could justify to himself and to them the deceptions, robberies, and murders which would have to be committed during that movement.\n\nAnd beginning with the French Revolution the old inadequately large group was destroyed, as well as the old habits and traditions, and step by step a group was formed of larger dimensions with new customs and traditions, and a man was produced who would stand at the head of the coming movement and bear the responsibility for all that had to be done.\n\nA man without convictions, without habits, without traditions, without a name, and not even a Frenchman, emerges\u2014by what seem the strangest chances\u2014from among all the seething French parties, and without joining any one of them is borne forward to a prominent position.\n\nThe ignorance of his colleagues, the weakness and insignificance of his opponents, the frankness of his falsehoods, and the dazzling and self-confident limitations of this man raise him to the head of the army. The brilliant qualities of the soldiers of the army sent to Italy, his opponents\u2019 reluctance to fight, and his own childish audacity and self-confidence secure him military fame. Innumerable so-called chances accompany him everywhere. The disfavor into which he falls with the rulers of France turns to his advantage. His attempts to avoid his predestined path are unsuccessful: he is not received into the Russian service, and the appointment he seeks in Turkey comes to nothing. During the war in Italy he is several times on the verge of destruction and each time is saved in an unexpected manner. Owing to various diplomatic considerations the Russian armies\u2014just those which might have destroyed his prestige\u2014do not appear upon the scene till he is no longer there.\n\nOn his return from Italy he finds the government in Paris in a process of dissolution in which all those who are in it are inevitably wiped out and destroyed. And by chance an escape from this dangerous position presents itself in the form of an aimless and senseless expedition to Africa. Again so-called chance accompanies him. Impregnable Malta surrenders without a shot; his most reckless schemes are crowned with success. The enemy\u2019s fleet, which subsequently did not let a single boat pass, allows his entire army to elude it. In Africa a whole series of outrages are committed against the almost unarmed inhabitants. And the men who commit these crimes, especially their leader, assure themselves that this is admirable, this is glory\u2014it resembles Caesar and Alexander the Great and is therefore good.\n\nThis ideal of glory and grandeur\u2014which consists not merely in considering nothing wrong that one does but in priding oneself on every crime one commits, ascribing to it an incomprehensible supernatural significance\u2014that ideal, destined to guide this man and his associates, had scope for its development in Africa. Whatever he does succeeds. The plague does not touch him. The cruelty of murdering prisoners is not imputed to him as a fault. His childishly rash, uncalled-for, and ignoble departure from Africa, leaving his comrades in distress, is set down to his credit, and again the enemy\u2019s fleet twice lets him slip past. When, intoxicated by the crimes he has committed so successfully, he reaches Paris, the dissolution of the republican government, which a year earlier might have ruined him, has reached its extreme limit, and his presence there now as a newcomer free from party entanglements can only serve to exalt him\u2014and though he himself has no plan, he is quite ready for his new r\u00f4le.\n\nHe had no plan, he was afraid of everything, but the parties snatched at him and demanded his participation.\n\nHe alone\u2014with his ideal of glory and grandeur developed in Italy and Egypt, his insane self-adulation, his boldness in crime and frankness in lying\u2014he alone could justify what had to be done.\n\nHe is needed for the place that awaits him, and so almost apart from his will and despite his indecision, his lack of a plan, and all his mistakes, he is drawn into a conspiracy that aims at seizing power and the conspiracy is crowned with success.\n\nHe is pushed into a meeting of the legislature. In alarm he wishes to flee, considering himself lost. He pretends to fall into a swoon and says senseless things that should have ruined him. But the once proud and shrewd rulers of France, feeling that their part is played out, are even more bewildered than he, and do not say the words they should have said to destroy him and retain their power.\n\nChance, millions of chances, give him power, and all men as if by agreement co-operate to confirm that power. Chance forms the characters of the rulers of France, who submit to him; chance forms the character of Paul I of Russia who recognizes his government; chance contrives a plot against him which not only fails to harm him but confirms his power. Chance puts the Duc d\u2019Enghien in his hands and unexpectedly causes him to kill him\u2014thereby convincing the mob more forcibly than in any other way that he had the right, since he had the might. Chance contrives that though he directs all his efforts to prepare an expedition against England (which would inevitably have ruined him) he never carries out that intention, but unexpectedly falls upon Mack and the Austrians, who surrender without a battle. Chance and genius give him the victory at Austerlitz; and by chance all men, not only the French but all Europe\u2014except England which does not take part in the events about to happen\u2014despite their former horror and detestation of his crimes, now recognize his authority, the title he has given himself, and his ideal of grandeur and glory, which seems excellent and reasonable to them all.\n\nAs if measuring themselves and preparing for the coming movement, the western forces push toward the east several times in 1805, 1806, 1807, and 1809, gaining strength and growing. In 1811 the group of people that had formed in France unites into one group with the peoples of Central Europe. The strength of the justification of the man who stands at the head of the movement grows with the increased size of the group. During the ten-year preparatory period this man had formed relations with all the crowned heads of Europe. The discredited rulers of the world can oppose no reasonable ideal to the insensate Napoleonic ideal of glory and grandeur. One after another they hasten to display their insignificance before him. The King of Prussia sends his wife to seek the great man\u2019s mercy; the Emperor of Austria considers it a favor that this man receives a daughter of the Caesars into his bed; the Pope, the guardian of all that the nations hold sacred, utilizes religion for the aggrandizement of the great man. It is not Napoleon who prepares himself for the accomplishment of his role, so much as all those round him who prepare him to take on himself the whole responsibility for what is happening and has to happen. There is no step, no crime or petty fraud he commits, which in the mouths of those around him is not at once represented as a great deed. The most suitable f\u00eate the Germans can devise for him is a celebration of Jena and Auerst\u00e4dt. Not only is he great, but so are his ancestors, his brothers, his stepsons, and his brothers-in-law. Everything is done to deprive him of the remains of his reason and to prepare him for his terrible part. And when he is ready so too are the forces.\n\nThe invasion pushes eastward and reaches its final goal\u2014Moscow. That city is taken; the Russian army suffers heavier losses than the opposing armies had suffered in the former war from Austerlitz to Wagram. But suddenly instead of those chances and that genius which hitherto had so consistently led him by an uninterrupted series of successes to the predestined goal, an innumerable sequence of inverse chances occur\u2014from the cold in his head at Borodin\u00f3 to the sparks which set Moscow on fire, and the frosts\u2014and instead of genius, stupidity and immeasurable baseness become evident.\n\nThe invaders flee, turn back, flee again, and all the chances are now not for Napoleon but always against him.\n\nA countermovement is then accomplished from east to west with a remarkable resemblance to the preceding movement from west to east. Attempted drives from east to west\u2014similar to the contrary movements of 1805, 1807, and 1809\u2014precede the great westward movement; there is the same coalescence into a group of enormous dimensions; the same adhesion of the people of Central Europe to the movement; the same hesitation midway, and the same increasing rapidity as the goal is approached.\n\nParis, the ultimate goal, is reached. The Napoleonic government and army are destroyed. Napoleon himself is no longer of any account; all his actions are evidently pitiful and mean, but again an inexplicable chance occurs. The allies detest Napoleon whom they regard as the cause of their sufferings. Deprived of power and authority, his crimes and his craft exposed, he should have appeared to them what he appeared ten years previously and one year later\u2014an outlawed brigand. But by some strange chance no one perceives this. His part is not yet ended. The man who ten years before and a year later was considered an outlawed brigand is sent to an island two days\u2019 sail from France, which for some reason is presented to him as his dominion, and guards are given to him and millions of money are paid him.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nThe flood of nations begins to subside into its normal channels. The waves of the great movement abate, and on the calm surface eddies are formed in which float the diplomatists, who imagine that they have caused the floods to abate.\n\nBut the smooth sea again suddenly becomes disturbed. The diplomatists think that their disagreements are the cause of this fresh pressure of natural forces; they anticipate war between their sovereigns; the position seems to them insoluble. But the wave they feel to be rising does not come from the quarter they expect. It rises again from the same point as before\u2014Paris. The last backwash of the movement from the west occurs: a backwash which serves to solve the apparently insuperable diplomatic difficulties and ends the military movement of that period of history.\n\nThe man who had devastated France returns to France alone, without any conspiracy and without soldiers. Any guard might arrest him, but by strange chance no one does so and all rapturously greet the man they cursed the day before and will curse again a month later.\n\nThis man is still needed to justify the final collective act.\n\nThat act is performed.\n\nThe last r\u00f4le is played. The actor is bidden to disrobe and wash off his powder and paint: he will not be wanted any more.\n\nAnd some years pass during which he plays a pitiful comedy to himself in solitude on his island, justifying his actions by intrigues and lies when the justification is no longer needed, and displaying to the whole world what it was that people had mistaken for strength as long as an unseen hand directed his actions.\n\nThe manager having brought the drama to a close and stripped the actor shows him to us.\n\n\u201cSee what you believed in! This is he! Do you now see that it was not he but I who moved you?\u201d\n\nBut dazed by the force of the movement, it was long before people understood this.\n\nStill greater coherence and inevitability is seen in the life of Alexander I, the man who stood at the head of the countermovement from east to west.\n\nWhat was needed for him who, overshadowing others, stood at the head of that movement from east to west?\n\nWhat was needed was a sense of justice and a sympathy with European affairs, but a remote sympathy not dulled by petty interests; a moral superiority over those sovereigns of the day who co-operated with him; a mild and attractive personality; and a personal grievance against Napoleon. And all this was found in Alexander I; all this had been prepared by innumerable so-called chances in his life: his education, his early liberalism, the advisers who surrounded him, and by Austerlitz, and Tilsit, and Erfurt.\n\nDuring the national war he was inactive because he was not needed. But as soon as the necessity for a general European war presented itself he appeared in his place at the given moment and, uniting the nations of Europe, led them to the goal.\n\nThe goal is reached. After the final war of 1815 Alexander possesses all possible power. How does he use it?\n\nAlexander I\u2014the pacifier of Europe, the man who from his early years had striven only for his people\u2019s welfare, the originator of the liberal innovations in his fatherland\u2014now that he seemed to possess the utmost power and therefore to have the possibility of bringing about the welfare of his peoples\u2014at the time when Napoleon in exile was drawing up childish and mendacious plans of how he would have made mankind happy had he retained power\u2014Alexander I, having fulfilled his mission and feeling the hand of God upon him, suddenly recognizes the insignificance of that supposed power, turns away from it, and gives it into the hands of contemptible men whom he despises, saying only:\n\n\u201cNot unto us, not unto us, but unto Thy Name!... I too am a man like the rest of you. Let me live like a man and think of my soul and of God.\u201d\n\nAs the sun and each atom of ether is a sphere complete in itself, and yet at the same time only a part of a whole too immense for man to comprehend, so each individual has within himself his own aims and yet has them to serve a general purpose incomprehensible to man.\n\nA bee settling on a flower has stung a child. And the child is afraid of bees and declares that bees exist to sting people. A poet admires the bee sucking from the chalice of a flower and says it exists to suck the fragrance of flowers. A beekeeper, seeing the bee collect pollen from flowers and carry it to the hive, says that it exists to gather honey. Another beekeeper who has studied the life of the hive more closely says that the bee gathers pollen dust to feed the young bees and rear a queen, and that it exists to perpetuate its race. A botanist notices that the bee flying with the pollen of a male flower to a pistil fertilizes the latter, and sees in this the purpose of the bee\u2019s existence. Another, observing the migration of plants, notices that the bee helps in this work, and may say that in this lies the purpose of the bee. But the ultimate purpose of the bee is not exhausted by the first, the second, or any of the processes the human mind can discern. The higher the human intellect rises in the discovery of these purposes, the more obvious it becomes, that the ultimate purpose is beyond our comprehension.\n\nAll that is accessible to man is the relation of the life of the bee to other manifestations of life. And so it is with the purpose of historic characters and nations.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nNat\u00e1sha\u2019s wedding to Bez\u00fakhov, which took place in 1813, was the last happy event in the family of the old Rost\u00f3vs. Count Ily\u00e1 Rost\u00f3v died that same year and, as always happens, after the father\u2019s death the family group broke up.\n\nThe events of the previous year: the burning of Moscow and the flight from it, the death of Prince Andrew, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s despair, P\u00e9tya\u2019s death, and the old countess\u2019 grief fell blow after blow on the old count\u2019s head. He seemed to be unable to understand the meaning of all these events, and bowed his old head in a spiritual sense as if expecting and inviting further blows which would finish him. He seemed now frightened and distraught and now unnaturally animated and enterprising.\n\nThe arrangements for Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s marriage occupied him for a while. He ordered dinners and suppers and obviously tried to appear cheerful, but his cheerfulness was not infectious as it used to be: on the contrary it evoked the compassion of those who knew and liked him.\n\nWhen Pierre and his wife had left, he grew very quiet and began to complain of depression. A few days later he fell ill and took to his bed. He realized from the first that he would not get up again, despite the doctor\u2019s encouragement. The countess passed a fortnight in an armchair by his pillow without undressing. Every time she gave him his medicine he sobbed and silently kissed her hand. On his last day, sobbing, he asked her and his absent son to forgive him for having dissipated their property\u2014that being the chief fault of which he was conscious. After receiving communion and unction he quietly died; and next day a throng of acquaintances who came to pay their last respects to the deceased filled the house rented by the Rost\u00f3vs. All these acquaintances, who had so often dined and danced at his house and had so often laughed at him, now said, with a common feeling of self-reproach and emotion, as if justifying themselves: \u201cWell, whatever he may have been he was a most worthy man. You don\u2019t meet such men nowadays.... And which of us has not weaknesses of his own?\u201d\n\nIt was just when the count\u2019s affairs had become so involved that it was impossible to say what would happen if he lived another year that he unexpectedly died.\n\nNicholas was with the Russian army in Paris when the news of his father\u2019s death reached him. He at once resigned his commission, and without waiting for it to be accepted took leave of absence and went to Moscow. The state of the count\u2019s affairs became quite obvious a month after his death, surprising everyone by the immense total of small debts the existence of which no one had suspected. The debts amounted to double the value of the property.\n\nFriends and relations advised Nicholas to decline the inheritance. But he regarded such a refusal as a slur on his father\u2019s memory, which he held sacred, and therefore would not hear of refusing and accepted the inheritance together with the obligation to pay the debts.\n\nThe creditors who had so long been silent, restrained by a vague but powerful influence exerted on them while he lived by the count\u2019s careless good nature, all proceeded to enforce their claims at once. As always happens in such cases rivalry sprang up as to which should get paid first, and those who like M\u00edtenka held promissory notes given them as presents now became the most exacting of the creditors. Nicholas was allowed no respite and no peace, and those who had seemed to pity the old man\u2014the cause of their losses (if they were losses)\u2014now remorselessly pursued the young heir who had voluntarily undertaken the debts and was obviously not guilty of contracting them.\n\nNot one of the plans Nicholas tried succeeded; the estate was sold by auction for half its value, and half the debts still remained unpaid. Nicholas accepted thirty thousand rubles offered him by his brother-in-law Bez\u00fakhov to pay off debts he regarded as genuinely due for value received. And to avoid being imprisoned for the remainder, as the creditors threatened, he re-entered the government service.\n\nHe could not rejoin the army where he would have been made colonel at the next vacancy, for his mother now clung to him as her one hold on life; and so despite his reluctance to remain in Moscow among people who had known him before, and despite his abhorrence of the civil service, he accepted a post in Moscow in that service, doffed the uniform of which he was so fond, and moved with his mother and S\u00f3nya to a small house on the S\u00edvtsev Vrazh\u00f3k.\n\nNat\u00e1sha and Pierre were living in Petersburg at the time and had no clear idea of Nicholas\u2019 circumstances. Having borrowed money from his brother-in-law, Nicholas tried to hide his wretched condition from him. His position was the more difficult because with his salary of twelve hundred rubles he had not only to keep himself, his mother, and S\u00f3nya, but had to shield his mother from knowledge of their poverty. The countess could not conceive of life without the luxurious conditions she had been used to from childhood and, unable to realize how hard it was for her son, kept demanding now a carriage (which they did not keep) to send for a friend, now some expensive article of food for herself, or wine for her son, or money to buy a present as a surprise for Nat\u00e1sha or S\u00f3nya, or for Nicholas himself.\n\nS\u00f3nya kept house, attended on her aunt, read to her, put up with her whims and secret ill-will, and helped Nicholas to conceal their poverty from the old countess. Nicholas felt himself irredeemably indebted to S\u00f3nya for all she was doing for his mother and greatly admired her patience and devotion, but tried to keep aloof from her.\n\nHe seemed in his heart to reproach her for being too perfect, and because there was nothing to reproach her with. She had all that people are valued for, but little that could have made him love her. He felt that the more he valued her the less he loved her. He had taken her at her word when she wrote giving him his freedom and now behaved as if all that had passed between them had been long forgotten and could never in any case be renewed.\n\nNicholas\u2019 position became worse and worse. The idea of putting something aside out of his salary proved a dream. Not only did he not save anything, but to comply with his mother\u2019s demands he even incurred some small debts. He could see no way out of this situation. The idea of marrying some rich woman, which was suggested to him by his female relations, was repugnant to him. The other way out\u2014his mother\u2019s death\u2014never entered his head. He wished for nothing and hoped for nothing, and deep in his heart experienced a gloomy and stern satisfaction in an uncomplaining endurance of his position. He tried to avoid his old acquaintances with their commiseration and offensive offers of assistance; he avoided all distraction and recreation, and even at home did nothing but play cards with his mother, pace silently up and down the room, and smoke one pipe after another. He seemed carefully to cherish within himself the gloomy mood which alone enabled him to endure his position.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nAt the beginning of winter Princess Mary came to Moscow. From reports current in town she learned how the Rost\u00f3vs were situated, and how \u201cthe son has sacrificed himself for his mother,\u201d as people were saying.\n\n\u201cI never expected anything else of him,\u201d said Princess Mary to herself, feeling a joyous sense of her love for him. Remembering her friendly relations with all the Rost\u00f3vs which had made her almost a member of the family, she thought it her duty to go to see them. But remembering her relations with Nicholas in Vor\u00f3nezh she was shy about doing so. Making a great effort she did however go to call on them a few weeks after her arrival in Moscow.\n\nNicholas was the first to meet her, as the countess\u2019 room could only be reached through his. But instead of being greeted with pleasure as she had expected, at his first glance at her his face assumed a cold, stiff, proud expression she had not seen on it before. He inquired about her health, led the way to his mother, and having sat there for five minutes left the room.\n\nWhen the princess came out of the countess\u2019 room Nicholas met her again, and with marked solemnity and stiffness accompanied her to the anteroom. To her remarks about his mother\u2019s health he made no reply. \u201cWhat\u2019s that to you? Leave me in peace,\u201d his looks seemed to say.\n\n\u201cWhy does she come prowling here? What does she want? I can\u2019t bear these ladies and all these civilities!\u201d said he aloud in S\u00f3nya\u2019s presence, evidently unable to repress his vexation, after the princess\u2019 carriage had disappeared.\n\n\u201cOh, Nicholas, how can you talk like that?\u201d cried S\u00f3nya, hardly able to conceal her delight. \u201cShe is so kind and Mamma is so fond of her!\u201d\n\nNicholas did not reply and tried to avoid speaking of the princess any more. But after her visit the old countess spoke of her several times a day.\n\nShe sang her praises, insisted that her son must call on her, expressed a wish to see her often, but yet always became ill-humored when she began to talk about her.\n\nNicholas tried to keep silence when his mother spoke of the princess, but his silence irritated her.\n\n\u201cShe is a very admirable and excellent young woman,\u201d said she, \u201cand you must go and call on her. You would at least be seeing somebody, and I think it must be dull for you only seeing us.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t in the least want to, Mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou used to want to, and now you don\u2019t. Really I don\u2019t understand you, my dear. One day you are dull, and the next you refuse to see anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I never said I was dull.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, you said yourself you don\u2019t want even to see her. She is a very admirable young woman and you always liked her, but now suddenly you have got some notion or other in your head. You hide everything from me.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot at all, Mamma.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I were asking you to do something disagreeable now\u2014but I only ask you to return a call. One would think mere politeness required it.... Well, I have asked you, and now I won\u2019t interfere any more since you have secrets from your mother.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, I\u2019ll go if you wish it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter to me. I only wish it for your sake.\u201d\n\nNicholas sighed, bit his mustache, and laid out the cards for a patience, trying to divert his mother\u2019s attention to another topic.\n\nThe same conversation was repeated next day and the day after, and the day after that.\n\nAfter her visit to the Rost\u00f3vs and her unexpectedly chilly reception by Nicholas, Princess Mary confessed to herself that she had been right in not wishing to be the first to call.\n\n\u201cI expected nothing else,\u201d she told herself, calling her pride to her aid. \u201cI have nothing to do with him and I only wanted to see the old lady, who was always kind to me and to whom I am under many obligations.\u201d\n\nBut she could not pacify herself with these reflections; a feeling akin to remorse troubled her when she thought of her visit. Though she had firmly resolved not to call on the Rost\u00f3vs again and to forget the whole matter, she felt herself all the time in an awkward position. And when she asked herself what distressed her, she had to admit that it was her relation to Rost\u00f3v. His cold, polite manner did not express his feeling for her (she knew that) but it concealed something, and until she could discover what that something was, she felt that she could not be at ease.\n\nOne day in midwinter when sitting in the schoolroom attending to her nephew\u2019s lessons, she was informed that Rost\u00f3v had called. With a firm resolution not to betray herself and not show her agitation, she sent for Mademoiselle Bourienne and went with her to the drawing room.\n\nHer first glance at Nicholas\u2019 face told her that he had only come to fulfill the demands of politeness, and she firmly resolved to maintain the tone in which he addressed her.\n\nThey spoke of the countess\u2019 health, of their mutual friends, of the latest war news, and when the ten minutes required by propriety had elapsed after which a visitor may rise, Nicholas got up to say good-by.\n\nWith Mademoiselle Bourienne\u2019s help the princess had maintained the conversation very well, but at the very last moment, just when he rose, she was so tired of talking of what did not interest her, and her mind was so full of the question why she alone was granted so little happiness in life, that in a fit of absent-mindedness she sat still, her luminous eyes gazing fixedly before her, not noticing that he had risen.\n\nNicholas glanced at her and, wishing to appear not to notice her abstraction, made some remark to Mademoiselle Bourienne and then again looked at the princess. She still sat motionless with a look of suffering on her gentle face. He suddenly felt sorry for her and was vaguely conscious that he might be the cause of the sadness her face expressed. He wished to help her and say something pleasant, but could think of nothing to say.\n\n\u201cGood-by, Princess!\u201d said he.\n\nShe started, flushed, and sighed deeply.\n\n\u201cOh, I beg your pardon,\u201d she said as if waking up. \u201cAre you going already, Count? Well then, good-by! Oh, but the cushion for the countess!\u201d\n\n\u201cWait a moment, I\u2019ll fetch it,\u201d said Mademoiselle Bourienne, and she left the room.\n\nThey both sat silent, with an occasional glance at one another.\n\n\u201cYes, Princess,\u201d said Nicholas at last with a sad smile, \u201cit doesn\u2019t seem long ago since we first met at Boguch\u00e1rovo, but how much water has flowed since then! In what distress we all seemed to be then, yet I would give much to bring back that time... but there\u2019s no bringing it back.\u201d\n\nPrincess Mary gazed intently into his eyes with her own luminous ones as he said this. She seemed to be trying to fathom the hidden meaning of his words which would explain his feeling for her.\n\n\u201cYes, yes,\u201d said she, \u201cbut you have no reason to regret the past, Count. As I understand your present life, I think you will always recall it with satisfaction, because the self-sacrifice that fills it now...\u201d\n\n\u201cI cannot accept your praise,\u201d he interrupted her hurriedly. \u201cOn the contrary I continually reproach myself.... But this is not at all an interesting or cheerful subject.\u201d\n\nHis face again resumed its former stiff and cold expression. But the princess had caught a glimpse of the man she had known and loved, and it was to him that she now spoke.\n\n\u201cI thought you would allow me to tell you this,\u201d she said. \u201cI had come so near to you... and to all your family that I thought you would not consider my sympathy misplaced, but I was mistaken,\u201d and suddenly her voice trembled. \u201cI don\u2019t know why,\u201d she continued, recovering herself, \u201cbut you used to be different, and...\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are a thousand reasons why,\u201d laying special emphasis on the why. \u201cThank you, Princess,\u201d he added softly. \u201cSometimes it is hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo that\u2019s why! That\u2019s why!\u201d a voice whispered in Princess Mary\u2019s soul. \u201cNo, it was not only that gay, kind, and frank look, not only that handsome exterior, that I loved in him. I divined his noble, resolute, self-sacrificing spirit too,\u201d she said to herself. \u201cYes, he is poor now and I am rich.... Yes, that\u2019s the only reason.... Yes, were it not for that...\u201d And remembering his former tenderness, and looking now at his kind, sorrowful face, she suddenly understood the cause of his coldness.\n\n\u201cBut why, Count, why?\u201d she almost cried, unconsciously moving closer to him. \u201cWhy? Tell me. You must tell me!\u201d\n\nHe was silent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand your why, Count,\u201d she continued, \u201cbut it\u2019s hard for me... I confess it. For some reason you wish to deprive me of our former friendship. And that hurts me.\u201d There were tears in her eyes and in her voice. \u201cI have had so little happiness in life that every loss is hard for me to bear.... Excuse me, good-by!\u201d and suddenly she began to cry and was hurrying from the room.\n\n\u201cPrincess, for God\u2019s sake!\u201d he exclaimed, trying to stop her. \u201cPrincess!\u201d\n\nShe turned round. For a few seconds they gazed silently into one another\u2019s eyes\u2014and what had seemed impossible and remote suddenly became possible, inevitable, and very near.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nIn the winter of 1813 Nicholas married Princess Mary and moved to Bald Hills with his wife, his mother, and S\u00f3nya.\n\nWithin four years he had paid off all his remaining debts without selling any of his wife\u2019s property, and having received a small inheritance on the death of a cousin he paid his debt to Pierre as well.\n\nIn another three years, by 1820, he had so managed his affairs that he was able to buy a small estate adjoining Bald Hills and was negotiating to buy back Otr\u00e1dnoe\u2014that being his pet dream.\n\nHaving started farming from necessity, he soon grew so devoted to it that it became his favorite and almost his sole occupation. Nicholas was a plain farmer: he did not like innovations, especially the English ones then coming into vogue. He laughed at theoretical treatises on estate management, disliked factories, the raising of expensive products, and the buying of expensive seed corn, and did not make a hobby of any particular part of the work on his estate. He always had before his mind\u2019s eye the estate as a whole and not any particular part of it. The chief thing in his eyes was not the nitrogen in the soil, nor the oxygen in the air, nor manures, nor special plows, but that most important agent by which nitrogen, oxygen, manure, and plow were made effective\u2014the peasant laborer. When Nicholas first began farming and began to understand its different branches, it was the serf who especially attracted his attention. The peasant seemed to him not merely a tool, but also a judge of farming and an end in himself. At first he watched the serfs, trying to understand their aims and what they considered good and bad, and only pretended to direct them and give orders while in reality learning from them their methods, their manner of speech, and their judgment of what was good and bad. Only when he had understood the peasants\u2019 tastes and aspirations, had learned to talk their language, to grasp the hidden meaning of their words, and felt akin to them did he begin boldly to manage his serfs, that is, to perform toward them the duties demanded of him. And Nicholas\u2019 management produced very brilliant results.\n\nGuided by some gift of insight, on taking up the management of the estates he at once unerringly appointed as bailiff, village elder, and delegate, the very men the serfs would themselves have chosen had they had the right to choose, and these posts never changed hands. Before analyzing the properties of manure, before entering into the debit and credit (as he ironically called it), he found out how many cattle the peasants had and increased the number by all possible means. He kept the peasant families together in the largest groups possible, not allowing the family groups to divide into separate households. He was hard alike on the lazy, the depraved, and the weak, and tried to get them expelled from the commune.\n\nHe was as careful of the sowing and reaping of the peasants\u2019 hay and corn as of his own, and few landowners had their crops sown and harvested so early and so well, or got so good a return, as did Nicholas.\n\nHe disliked having anything to do with the domestic serfs\u2014the \u201cdrones\u201d as he called them\u2014and everyone said he spoiled them by his laxity. When a decision had to be taken regarding a domestic serf, especially if one had to be punished, he always felt undecided and consulted everybody in the house; but when it was possible to have a domestic serf conscripted instead of a land worker he did so without the least hesitation. He never felt any hesitation in dealing with the peasants. He knew that his every decision would be approved by them all with very few exceptions.\n\nHe did not allow himself either to be hard on or punish a man, or to make things easy for or reward anyone, merely because he felt in", "sequence": 29}, {"offset": 3000000, "text": "clined to do so. He could not have said by what standard he judged what he should or should not do, but the standard was quite firm and definite in his own mind.\n\nOften, speaking with vexation of some failure or irregularity, he would say: \u201cWhat can one do with our Russian peasants?\u201d and imagined that he could not bear them.\n\nYet he loved \u201cour Russian peasants\u201d and their way of life with his whole soul, and for that very reason had understood and assimilated the one way and manner of farming which produced good results.\n\nCountess Mary was jealous of this passion of her husband\u2019s and regretted that she could not share it; but she could not understand the joys and vexations he derived from that world, to her so remote and alien. She could not understand why he was so particularly animated and happy when, after getting up at daybreak and spending the whole morning in the fields or on the threshing floor, he returned from the sowing or mowing or reaping to have tea with her. She did not understand why he spoke with such admiration and delight of the farming of the thrifty and well-to-do peasant Matthew Erm\u00edshin, who with his family had carted corn all night; or of the fact that his (Nicholas\u2019) sheaves were already stacked before anyone else had his harvest in. She did not understand why he stepped out from the window to the veranda and smiled under his mustache and winked so joyfully, when warm steady rain began to fall on the dry and thirsty shoots of the young oats, or why when the wind carried away a threatening cloud during the hay harvest he would return from the barn, flushed, sunburned, and perspiring, with a smell of wormwood and gentian in his hair and, gleefully rubbing his hands, would say: \u201cWell, one more day and my grain and the peasants\u2019 will all be under cover.\u201d\n\nStill less did she understand why he, kindhearted and always ready to anticipate her wishes, should become almost desperate when she brought him a petition from some peasant men or women who had appealed to her to be excused some work; why he, that kind Nicholas, should obstinately refuse her, angrily asking her not to interfere in what was not her business. She felt he had a world apart, which he loved passionately and which had laws she had not fathomed.\n\nSometimes when, trying to understand him, she spoke of the good work he was doing for his serfs, he would be vexed and reply: \u201cNot in the least; it never entered my head and I wouldn\u2019t do that for their good! That\u2019s all poetry and old wives\u2019 talk\u2014all that doing good to one\u2019s neighbor! What I want is that our children should not have to go begging. I must put our affairs in order while I am alive, that\u2019s all. And to do that, order and strictness are essential.... That\u2019s all about it!\u201d said he, clenching his vigorous fist. \u201cAnd fairness, of course,\u201d he added, \u201cfor if the peasant is naked and hungry and has only one miserable horse, he can do no good either for himself or for me.\u201d\n\nAnd all Nicholas did was fruitful\u2014probably just because he refused to allow himself to think that he was doing good to others for virtue\u2019s sake. His means increased rapidly; serfs from neighboring estates came to beg him to buy them, and long after his death the memory of his administration was devoutly preserved among the serfs. \u201cHe was a master... the peasants\u2019 affairs first and then his own. Of course he was not to be trifled with either\u2014in a word, he was a real master!\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nOne matter connected with his management sometimes worried Nicholas, and that was his quick temper together with his old hussar habit of making free use of his fists. At first he saw nothing reprehensible in this, but in the second year of his marriage his view of that form of punishment suddenly changed.\n\nOnce in summer he had sent for the village elder from Boguch\u00e1rovo, a man who had succeeded to the post when Dron died and who was accused of dishonesty and various irregularities. Nicholas went out into the porch to question him, and immediately after the elder had given a few replies the sound of cries and blows were heard. On returning to lunch Nicholas went up to his wife, who sat with her head bent low over her embroidery frame, and as usual began to tell her what he had been doing that morning. Among other things he spoke of the Boguch\u00e1rovo elder. Countess Mary turned red and then pale, but continued to sit with head bowed and lips compressed and gave her husband no reply.\n\n\u201cSuch an insolent scoundrel!\u201d he cried, growing hot again at the mere recollection of him. \u201cIf he had told me he was drunk and did not see... But what is the matter with you, Mary?\u201d he suddenly asked.\n\nCountess Mary raised her head and tried to speak, but hastily looked down again and her lips puckered.\n\n\u201cWhy, whatever is the matter, my dearest?\u201d\n\nThe looks of the plain Countess Mary always improved when she was in tears. She never cried from pain or vexation, but always from sorrow or pity, and when she wept her radiant eyes acquired an irresistible charm.\n\nThe moment Nicholas took her hand she could no longer restrain herself and began to cry.\n\n\u201cNicholas, I saw it... he was to blame, but why do you... Nicholas!\u201d and she covered her face with her hands.\n\nNicholas said nothing. He flushed crimson, left her side, and paced up and down the room. He understood what she was weeping about, but could not in his heart at once agree with her that what he had regarded from childhood as quite an everyday event was wrong. \u201cIs it just sentimentality, old wives\u2019 tales, or is she right?\u201d he asked himself. Before he had solved that point he glanced again at her face filled with love and pain, and he suddenly realized that she was right and that he had long been sinning against himself.\n\n\u201cMary,\u201d he said softly, going up to her, \u201cit will never happen again; I give you my word. Never,\u201d he repeated in a trembling voice like a boy asking for forgiveness.\n\nThe tears flowed faster still from the countess\u2019 eyes. She took his hand and kissed it.\n\n\u201cNicholas, when did you break your cameo?\u201d she asked to change the subject, looking at his finger on which he wore a ring with a cameo of Laoco\u00f6n\u2019s head.\n\n\u201cToday\u2014it was the same affair. Oh, Mary, don\u2019t remind me of it!\u201d and again he flushed. \u201cI give you my word of honor it shan\u2019t occur again, and let this always be a reminder to me,\u201d and he pointed to the broken ring.\n\nAfter that, when in discussions with his village elders or stewards the blood rushed to his face and his fists began to clench, Nicholas would turn the broken ring on his finger and would drop his eyes before the man who was making him angry. But he did forget himself once or twice within a twelvemonth, and then he would go and confess to his wife, and would again promise that this should really be the very last time.\n\n\u201cMary, you must despise me!\u201d he would say. \u201cI deserve it.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou should go, go away at once, if you don\u2019t feel strong enough to control yourself,\u201d she would reply sadly, trying to comfort her husband.\n\nAmong the gentry of the province Nicholas was respected but not liked. He did not concern himself with the interests of his own class, and consequently some thought him proud and others thought him stupid. The whole summer, from spring sowing to harvest, he was busy with the work on his farm. In autumn he gave himself up to hunting with the same business-like seriousness\u2014leaving home for a month, or even two, with his hunt. In winter he visited his other villages or spent his time reading. The books he read were chiefly historical, and on these he spent a certain sum every year. He was collecting, as he said, a serious library, and he made it a rule to read through all the books he bought. He would sit in his study with a grave air, reading\u2014a task he first imposed upon himself as a duty, but which afterwards became a habit affording him a special kind of pleasure and a consciousness of being occupied with serious matters. In winter, except for business excursions, he spent most of his time at home making himself one with his family and entering into all the details of his children\u2019s relations with their mother. The harmony between him and his wife grew closer and closer and he daily discovered fresh spiritual treasures in her.\n\nFrom the time of his marriage S\u00f3nya had lived in his house. Before that, Nicholas had told his wife all that had passed between himself and S\u00f3nya, blaming himself and commending her. He had asked Princess Mary to be gentle and kind to his cousin. She thoroughly realized the wrong he had done S\u00f3nya, felt herself to blame toward her, and imagined that her wealth had influenced Nicholas\u2019 choice. She could not find fault with S\u00f3nya in any way and tried to be fond of her, but often felt ill-will toward her which she could not overcome.\n\nOnce she had a talk with her friend Nat\u00e1sha about S\u00f3nya and about her own injustice toward her.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, \u201cyou have read the Gospels a great deal\u2014there is a passage in them that just fits S\u00f3nya.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?\u201d asked Countess Mary, surprised.\n\n\u201c\u2018To him that hath shall be given, and from him that hath not shall be taken away.\u2019 You remember? She is one that hath not; why, I don\u2019t know. Perhaps she lacks egotism, I don\u2019t know, but from her is taken away, and everything has been taken away. Sometimes I am dreadfully sorry for her. Formerly I very much wanted Nicholas to marry her, but I always had a sort of presentiment that it would not come off. She is a sterile flower, you know\u2014like some strawberry blossoms. Sometimes I am sorry for her, and sometimes I think she doesn\u2019t feel it as you or I would.\u201d\n\nThough Countess Mary told Nat\u00e1sha that those words in the Gospel must be understood differently, yet looking at S\u00f3nya she agreed with Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s explanation. It really seemed that S\u00f3nya did not feel her position trying, and had grown quite reconciled to her lot as a sterile flower. She seemed to be fond not so much of individuals as of the family as a whole. Like a cat, she had attached herself not to the people but to the home. She waited on the old countess, petted and spoiled the children, was always ready to render the small services for which she had a gift, and all this was unconsciously accepted from her with insufficient gratitude.\n\nThe country seat at Bald Hills had been rebuilt, though not on the same scale as under the old prince.\n\nThe buildings, begun under straitened circumstances, were more than simple. The immense house on the old stone foundations was of wood, plastered only inside. It had bare deal floors and was furnished with very simple hard sofas, armchairs, tables, and chairs made by their own serf carpenters out of their own birchwood. The house was spacious and had rooms for the house serfs and apartments for visitors. Whole families of the Rost\u00f3vs\u2019 and Bolk\u00f3nskis\u2019 relations sometimes came to Bald Hills with sixteen horses and dozens of servants and stayed for months. Besides that, four times a year, on the name days and birthdays of the hosts, as many as a hundred visitors would gather there for a day or two. The rest of the year life pursued its unbroken routine with its ordinary occupations, and its breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and suppers, provided out of the produce of the estate.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nIt was the eve of St. Nicholas, the fifth of December, 1820. Nat\u00e1sha had been staying at her brother\u2019s with her husband and children since early autumn. Pierre had gone to Petersburg on business of his own for three weeks as he said, but had remained there nearly seven weeks and was expected back every minute.\n\nBesides the Bez\u00fakhov family, Nicholas\u2019 old friend the retired General Vas\u00edli Dm\u00edtrich Den\u00edsov was staying with the Rost\u00f3vs this fifth of December.\n\nOn the sixth, which was his name day when the house would be full of visitors, Nicholas knew he would have to exchange his Tartar tunic for a tail coat, and put on narrow boots with pointed toes, and drive to the new church he had built, and then receive visitors who would come to congratulate him, offer them refreshments, and talk about the elections of the nobility; but he considered himself entitled to spend the eve of that day in his usual way. He examined the bailiff\u2019s accounts of the village in Ryaz\u00e1n which belonged to his wife\u2019s nephew, wrote two business letters, and walked over to the granaries, cattle yards and stables before dinner. Having taken precautions against the general drunkenness to be expected on the morrow because it was a great saint\u2019s day, he returned to dinner, and without having time for a private talk with his wife sat down at the long table laid for twenty persons, at which the whole household had assembled. At that table were his mother, his mother\u2019s old lady companion Bel\u00f3va, his wife, their three children with their governess and tutor, his wife\u2019s nephew with his tutor, S\u00f3nya, Den\u00edsov, Nat\u00e1sha, her three children, their governess, and old Michael Iv\u00e1novich, the late prince\u2019s architect, who was living on in retirement at Bald Hills.\n\nCountess Mary sat at the other end of the table. When her husband took his place she concluded, from the rapid manner in which after taking up his table napkin he pushed back the tumbler and wineglass standing before him, that he was out of humor, as was sometimes the case when he came in to dinner straight from the farm\u2014especially before the soup. Countess Mary well knew that mood of his, and when she herself was in a good frame of mind quietly waited till he had had his soup and then began to talk to him and make him admit that there was no cause for his ill-humor. But today she quite forgot that and was hurt that he should be angry with her without any reason, and she felt unhappy. She asked him where he had been. He replied. She again inquired whether everything was going well on the farm. Her unnatural tone made him wince unpleasantly and he replied hastily.\n\n\u201cThen I\u2019m not mistaken,\u201d thought Countess Mary. \u201cWhy is he cross with me?\u201d She concluded from his tone that he was vexed with her and wished to end the conversation. She knew her remarks sounded unnatural, but could not refrain from asking some more questions.\n\nThanks to Den\u00edsov the conversation at table soon became general and lively, and she did not talk to her husband. When they left the table and went as usual to thank the old countess, Countess Mary held out her hand and kissed her husband, and asked him why he was angry with her.\n\n\u201cYou always have such strange fancies! I didn\u2019t even think of being angry,\u201d he replied.\n\nBut the word always seemed to her to imply: \u201cYes, I am angry but I won\u2019t tell you why.\u201d\n\nNicholas and his wife lived together so happily that even S\u00f3nya and the old countess, who felt jealous and would have liked them to disagree, could find nothing to reproach them with; but even they had their moments of antagonism. Occasionally, and it was always just after they had been happiest together, they suddenly had a feeling of estrangement and hostility, which occurred most frequently during Countess Mary\u2019s pregnancies, and this was such a time.\n\n\u201cWell, messieurs et mesdames,\u201d said Nicholas loudly and with apparent cheerfulness (it seemed to Countess Mary that he did it on purpose to vex her), \u201cI have been on my feet since six this morning. Tomorrow I shall have to suffer, so today I\u2019ll go and rest.\u201d\n\nAnd without a word to his wife he went to the little sitting room and lay down on the sofa.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s always the way,\u201d thought Countess Mary. \u201cHe talks to everyone except me. I see... I see that I am repulsive to him, especially when I am in this condition.\u201d She looked down at her expanded figure and in the glass at her pale, sallow, emaciated face in which her eyes now looked larger than ever.\n\nAnd everything annoyed her\u2014Den\u00edsov\u2019s shouting and laughter, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s talk, and especially a quick glance S\u00f3nya gave her.\n\nS\u00f3nya was always the first excuse Countess Mary found for feeling irritated.\n\nHaving sat awhile with her visitors without understanding anything of what they were saying, she softly left the room and went to the nursery.\n\nThe children were playing at \u201cgoing to Moscow\u201d in a carriage made of chairs and invited her to go with them. She sat down and played with them a little, but the thought of her husband and his unreasonable crossness worried her. She got up and, walking on tiptoe with difficulty, went to the small sitting room.\n\n\u201cPerhaps he is not asleep; I\u2019ll have an explanation with him,\u201d she said to herself. Little Andrew, her eldest boy, imitating his mother, followed her on tiptoe. She did not notice him.\n\n\u201cMary, dear, I think he is asleep\u2014he was so tired,\u201d said S\u00f3nya, meeting her in the large sitting room (it seemed to Countess Mary that she crossed her path everywhere). \u201cAndrew may wake him.\u201d\n\nCountess Mary looked round, saw little Andrew following her, felt that S\u00f3nya was right, and for that very reason flushed and with evident difficulty refrained from saying something harsh. She made no reply, but to avoid obeying S\u00f3nya beckoned to Andrew to follow her quietly and went to the door. S\u00f3nya went away by another door. From the room in which Nicholas was sleeping came the sound of his even breathing, every slightest tone of which was familiar to his wife. As she listened to it she saw before her his smooth handsome forehead, his mustache, and his whole face, as she had so often seen it in the stillness of the night when he slept. Nicholas suddenly moved and cleared his throat. And at that moment little Andrew shouted from outside the door: \u201cPapa! Mamma\u2019s standing here!\u201d Countess Mary turned pale with fright and made signs to the boy. He grew silent, and quiet ensued for a moment, terrible to Countess Mary. She knew how Nicholas disliked being waked. Then through the door she heard Nicholas clearing his throat again and stirring, and his voice said crossly:\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t get a moment\u2019s peace.... Mary, is that you? Why did you bring him here?\u201d\n\n\u201cI only came in to look and did not notice... forgive me....\u201d\n\nNicholas coughed and said no more. Countess Mary moved away from the door and took the boy back to the nursery. Five minutes later little black-eyed three-year-old Nat\u00e1sha, her father\u2019s pet, having learned from her brother that Papa was asleep and Mamma was in the sitting room, ran to her father unobserved by her mother. The dark-eyed little girl boldly opened the creaking door, went up to the sofa with energetic steps of her sturdy little legs, and having examined the position of her father, who was asleep with his back to her, rose on tiptoe and kissed the hand which lay under his head. Nicholas turned with a tender smile on his face.\n\n\u201cNat\u00e1sha, Nat\u00e1sha!\u201d came Countess Mary\u2019s frightened whisper from the door. \u201cPapa wants to sleep.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, Mamma, he doesn\u2019t want to sleep,\u201d said little Nat\u00e1sha with conviction. \u201cHe\u2019s laughing.\u201d\n\nNicholas lowered his legs, rose, and took his daughter in his arms.\n\n\u201cCome in, Mary,\u201d he said to his wife.\n\nShe went in and sat down by her husband.\n\n\u201cI did not notice him following me,\u201d she said timidly. \u201cI just looked in.\u201d\n\nHolding his little girl with one arm, Nicholas glanced at his wife and, seeing her guilty expression, put his other arm around her and kissed her hair.\n\n\u201cMay I kiss Mamma?\u201d he asked Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nNat\u00e1sha smiled bashfully.\n\n\u201cAgain!\u201d she commanded, pointing with a peremptory gesture to the spot where Nicholas had placed the kiss.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why you think I am cross,\u201d said Nicholas, replying to the question he knew was in his wife\u2019s mind.\n\n\u201cYou have no idea how unhappy, how lonely, I feel when you are like that. It always seems to me...\u201d\n\n\u201cMary, don\u2019t talk nonsense. You ought to be ashamed of yourself!\u201d he said gaily.\n\n\u201cIt seems to be that you can\u2019t love me, that I am so plain... always... and now... in this cond...\u201d\n\n\u201cOh, how absurd you are! It is not beauty that endears, it\u2019s love that makes us see beauty. It is only Malv\u00ednas and women of that kind who are loved for their beauty. But do I love my wife? I don\u2019t love her, but... I don\u2019t know how to put it. Without you, or when something comes between us like this, I seem lost and can\u2019t do anything. Now do I love my finger? I don\u2019t love it, but just try to cut it off!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not like that myself, but I understand. So you\u2019re not angry with me?\u201d\n\n\u201cAwfully angry!\u201d he said, smiling and getting up. And smoothing his hair he began to pace the room.\n\n\u201cDo you know, Mary, what I\u2019ve been thinking?\u201d he began, immediately thinking aloud in his wife\u2019s presence now that they had made it up.\n\nHe did not ask if she was ready to listen to him. He did not care. A thought had occurred to him and so it belonged to her also. And he told her of his intention to persuade Pierre to stay with them till spring.\n\nCountess Mary listened till he had finished, made some remark, and in her turn began thinking aloud. Her thoughts were about the children.\n\n\u201cYou can see the woman in her already,\u201d she said in French, pointing to little Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cYou reproach us women with being illogical. Here is our logic. I say: \u2018Papa wants to sleep!\u2019 but she says, \u2018No, he\u2019s laughing.\u2019 And she was right,\u201d said Countess Mary with a happy smile.\n\n\u201cYes, yes.\u201d And Nicholas, taking his little daughter in his strong hand, lifted her high, placed her on his shoulder, held her by the legs, and paced the room with her. There was an expression of carefree happiness on the faces of both father and daughter.\n\n\u201cBut you know you may be unfair. You are too fond of this one,\u201d his wife whispered in French.\n\n\u201cYes, but what am I to do?... I try not to show...\u201d\n\nAt that moment they heard the sound of the door pulley and footsteps in the hall and anteroom, as if someone had arrived.\n\n\u201cSomebody has come.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sure it is Pierre. I will go and see,\u201d said Countess Mary and left the room.\n\nIn her absence Nicholas allowed himself to give his little daughter a gallop round the room. Out of breath, he took the laughing child quickly from his shoulder and pressed her to his heart. His capers reminded him of dancing, and looking at the child\u2019s round happy little face he thought of what she would be like when he was an old man, taking her into society and dancing the mazurka with her as his old father had danced Daniel Cooper with his daughter.\n\n\u201cIt is he, it is he, Nicholas!\u201d said Countess Mary, re-entering the room a few minutes later. \u201cNow our Nat\u00e1sha has come to life. You should have seen her ecstasy, and how he caught it for having stayed away so long. Well, come along now, quick, quick! It\u2019s time you two were parted,\u201d she added, looking smilingly at the little girl who clung to her father.\n\nNicholas went out holding the child by the hand.\n\nCountess Mary remained in the sitting room.\n\n\u201cI should never, never have believed that one could be so happy,\u201d she whispered to herself. A smile lit up her face but at the same time she sighed, and her deep eyes expressed a quiet sadness as though she felt, through her happiness, that there is another sort of happiness unattainable in this life and of which she involuntarily thought at that instant.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nNat\u00e1sha had married in the early spring of 1813, and in 1820 already had three daughters besides a son for whom she had longed and whom she was now nursing. She had grown stouter and broader, so that it was difficult to recognize in this robust, motherly woman the slim, lively Nat\u00e1sha of former days. Her features were more defined and had a calm, soft, and serene expression. In her face there was none of the ever-glowing animation that had formerly burned there and constituted its charm. Now her face and body were often all that one saw, and her soul was not visible at all. All that struck the eye was a strong, handsome, and fertile woman. The old fire very rarely kindled in her face now. That happened only when, as was the case that day, her husband returned home, or a sick child was convalescent, or when she and Countess Mary spoke of Prince Andrew (she never mentioned him to her husband, who she imagined was jealous of Prince Andrew\u2019s memory), or on the rare occasions when something happened to induce her to sing, a practice she had quite abandoned since her marriage. At the rare moments when the old fire did kindle in her handsome, fully developed body she was even more attractive than in former days.\n\nSince their marriage Nat\u00e1sha and her husband had lived in Moscow, in Petersburg, on their estate near Moscow, or with her mother, that is to say, in Nicholas\u2019 house. The young Countess Bez\u00fakhova was not often seen in society, and those who met her there were not pleased with her and found her neither attractive nor amiable. Not that Nat\u00e1sha liked solitude\u2014she did not know whether she liked it or not, she even thought that she did not\u2014but with her pregnancies, her confinements, the nursing of her children, and sharing every moment of her husband\u2019s life, she had demands on her time which could be satisfied only by renouncing society. All who had known Nat\u00e1sha before her marriage wondered at the change in her as at something extraordinary. Only the old countess with her maternal instinct had realized that all Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s outbursts had been due to her need of children and a husband\u2014as she herself had once exclaimed at Otr\u00e1dnoe not so much in fun as in earnest\u2014and her mother was now surprised at the surprise expressed by those who had never understood Nat\u00e1sha, and she kept saying that she had always known that Nat\u00e1sha would make an exemplary wife and mother.\n\n\u201cOnly she lets her love of her husband and children overflow all bounds,\u201d said the countess, \u201cso that it even becomes absurd.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not follow the golden rule advocated by clever folk, especially by the French, which says that a girl should not let herself go when she marries, should not neglect her accomplishments, should be even more careful of her appearance than when she was unmarried, and should fascinate her husband as much as she did before he became her husband. Nat\u00e1sha on the contrary had at once abandoned all her witchery, of which her singing had been an unusually powerful part. She gave it up just because it was so powerfully seductive. She took no pains with her manners or with delicacy of speech, or with her toilet, or to show herself to her husband in her most becoming attitudes, or to avoid inconveniencing him by being too exacting. She acted in contradiction to all those rules. She felt that the allurements instinct had formerly taught her to use would now be merely ridiculous in the eyes of her husband, to whom she had from the first moment given herself up entirely\u2014that is, with her whole soul, leaving no corner of it hidden from him. She felt that her unity with her husband was not maintained by the poetic feelings that had attracted him to her, but by something else\u2014indefinite but firm as the bond between her own body and soul.\n\nTo fluff out her curls, put on fashionable dresses, and sing romantic songs to fascinate her husband would have seemed as strange as to adorn herself to attract herself. To adorn herself for others might perhaps have been agreeable\u2014she did not know\u2014but she had no time at all for it. The chief reason for devoting no time either to singing, to dress, or to choosing her words was that she really had no time to spare for these things.\n\nWe know that man has the faculty of becoming completely absorbed in a subject however trivial it may be, and that there is no subject so trivial that it will not grow to infinite proportions if one\u2019s entire attention is devoted to it.\n\nThe subject which wholly engrossed Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s attention was her family: that is, her husband whom she had to keep so that he should belong entirely to her and to the home, and the children whom she had to bear, bring into the world, nurse, and bring up.\n\nAnd the deeper she penetrated, not with her mind only but with her whole soul, her whole being, into the subject that absorbed her, the larger did that subject grow and the weaker and more inadequate did her powers appear, so that she concentrated them wholly on that one thing and yet was unable to accomplish all that she considered necessary.\n\nThere were then as now conversations and discussions about women\u2019s rights, the relations of husband and wife and their freedom and rights, though these themes were not yet termed questions as they are now; but these topics were not merely uninteresting to Nat\u00e1sha, she positively did not understand them.\n\nThese questions, then as now, existed only for those who see nothing in marriage but the pleasure married people get from one another, that is, only the beginnings of marriage and not its whole significance, which lies in the family.\n\nDiscussions and questions of that kind, which are like the question of how to get the greatest gratification from one\u2019s dinner, did not then and do not now exist for those for whom the purpose of a dinner is the nourishment it affords; and the purpose of marriage is the family.\n\nIf the purpose of dinner is to nourish the body, a man who eats two dinners at once may perhaps get more enjoyment but will not attain his purpose, for his stomach will not digest the two dinners.\n\nIf the purpose of marriage is the family, the person who wishes to have many wives or husbands may perhaps obtain much pleasure, but in that case will not have a family.\n\nIf the purpose of food is nourishment and the purpose of marriage is the family, the whole question resolves itself into not eating more than one can digest, and not having more wives or husbands than are needed for the family\u2014that is, one wife or one husband. Nat\u00e1sha needed a husband. A husband was given her and he gave her a family. And she not only saw no need of any other or better husband, but as all the powers of her soul were intent on serving that husband and family, she could not imagine and saw no interest in imagining how it would be if things were different.\n\nNat\u00e1sha did not care for society in general, but prized the more the society of her relatives\u2014Countess Mary, and her brother, her mother, and S\u00f3nya. She valued the company of those to whom she could come striding disheveled from the nursery in her dressing gown, and with joyful face show a yellow instead of a green stain on baby\u2019s napkin, and from whom she could hear reassuring words to the effect that baby was much better.\n\nTo such an extent had Nat\u00e1sha let herself go that the way she dressed and did her hair, her ill-chosen words, and her jealousy\u2014she was jealous of S\u00f3nya, of the governess, and of every woman, pretty or plain\u2014were habitual subjects of jest to those about her. The general opinion was that Pierre was under his wife\u2019s thumb, which was really true. From the very first days of their married life Nat\u00e1sha had announced her demands. Pierre was greatly surprised by his wife\u2019s view, to him a perfectly novel one, that every moment of his life belonged to her and to the family. His wife\u2019s demands astonished him, but they also flattered him, and he submitted to them.\n\nPierre\u2019s subjection consisted in the fact that he not only dared not flirt with, but dared not even speak smilingly to, any other woman; did not dare dine at the Club as a pastime, did not dare spend money on a whim, and did not dare absent himself for any length of time, except on business\u2014in which his wife included his intellectual pursuits, which she did not in the least understand but to which she attributed great importance. To make up for this, at home Pierre had the right to regulate his life and that of the whole family exactly as he chose. At home Nat\u00e1sha placed herself in the position of a slave to her husband, and the whole household went on tiptoe when he was occupied\u2014that is, was reading or writing in his study. Pierre had but to show a partiality for anything to get just what he liked done always. He had only to express a wish and Nat\u00e1sha would jump up and run to fulfill it.\n\nThe entire household was governed according to Pierre\u2019s supposed orders, that is, by his wishes which Nat\u00e1sha tried to guess. Their way of life and place of residence, their acquaintances and ties, Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s occupations, the children\u2019s upbringing, were all selected not merely with regard to Pierre\u2019s expressed wishes, but to what Nat\u00e1sha from the thoughts he expressed in conversation supposed his wishes to be. And she deduced the essentials of his wishes quite correctly, and having once arrived at them clung to them tenaciously. When Pierre himself wanted to change his mind she would fight him with his own weapons.\n\nThus in a time of trouble ever memorable to him after the birth of their first child who was delicate, when they had to change the wet nurse three times and Nat\u00e1sha fell ill from despair, Pierre one day told her of Rousseau\u2019s view, with which he quite agreed, that to have a wet nurse is unnatural and harmful. When her next baby was born, despite the opposition of her mother, the doctors, and even of her husband himself\u2014who were all vigorously opposed to her nursing her baby herself, a thing then unheard of and considered injurious\u2014she insisted on having her own way, and after that nursed all her babies herself.\n\nIt very often happened that in a moment of irritation husband and wife would have a dispute, but long afterwards Pierre to his surprise and delight would find in his wife\u2019s ideas and actions the very thought against which she had argued, but divested of everything superfluous that in the excitement of the dispute he had added when expressing his opinion.\n\nAfter seven years of marriage Pierre had the joyous and firm consciousness that he was not a bad man, and he felt this because he saw himself reflected in his wife. He felt the good and bad within himself inextricably mingled and overlapping. But only what was really good in him was reflected in his wife, all that was not quite good was rejected. And this was not the result of logical reasoning but was a direct and mysterious reflection.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nTwo months previously when Pierre was already staying with the Rost\u00f3vs he had received a letter from Prince Theodore, asking him to come to Petersburg to confer on some important questions that were being discussed there by a society of which Pierre was one of the principal founders.\n\nOn reading that letter (she always read her husband\u2019s letters) Nat\u00e1sha herself suggested that he should go to Petersburg, though she would feel his absence very acutely. She attributed immense importance to all her husband\u2019s intellectual and abstract interests though she did not understand them, and she always dreaded being a hindrance to him in such matters. To Pierre\u2019s timid look of inquiry after reading the letter she replied by asking him to go, but to fix a definite date for his return. He was given four weeks\u2019 leave of absence.\n\nEver since that leave of absence had expired, more than a fortnight before, Nat\u00e1sha had been in a constant state of alarm, depression, and irritability.\n\nDen\u00edsov, now a general on the retired list and much dissatisfied with the present state of affairs, had arrived during that fortnight. He looked at Nat\u00e1sha with sorrow and surprise as at a bad likeness of a person once dear. A dull, dejected look, random replies, and talk about the nursery was all he saw and heard from his former enchantress.\n\nNat\u00e1sha was sad and irritable all that time, especially when her mother, her brother, S\u00f3nya, or Countess Mary in their efforts to console her tried to excuse Pierre and suggested reasons for his delay in returning.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all nonsense, all rubbish\u2014those discussions which lead to nothing and all those idiotic societies!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha declared of the very affairs in the immense importance of which she firmly believed.\n\nAnd she would go to the nursery to nurse P\u00e9tya, her only boy. No one else could tell her anything so comforting or so reasonable as this little three-month-old creature when he lay at her breast and she was conscious of the movement of his lips and the snuffling of his little nose. That creature said: \u201cYou are angry, you are jealous, you would like to pay him out, you are afraid\u2014but here am I! And I am he...\u201d and that was unanswerable. It was more than true.\n\nDuring that fortnight of anxiety Nat\u00e1sha resorted to the baby for comfort so often, and fussed over him so much, that she overfed him and he fell ill. She was terrified by his illness, and yet that was just what she needed. While attending to him she bore the anxiety about her husband more easily.\n\nShe was nursing her boy when the sound of Pierre\u2019s sleigh was heard at the front door, and the old nurse\u2014knowing how to please her mistress\u2014entered the room inaudibly but hurriedly and with a beaming face.\n\n\u201cHas he come?\u201d Nat\u00e1sha asked quickly in a whisper, afraid to move lest she should rouse the dozing baby.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come, ma\u2019am,\u201d whispered the nurse.\n\nThe blood rushed to Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face and her feet involuntarily moved, but she could not jump up and run out. The baby again opened his eyes and looked at her. \u201cYou\u2019re here?\u201d he seemed to be saying, and again lazily smacked his lips.\n\nCautiously withdrawing her breast, Nat\u00e1sha rocked him a little, handed him to the nurse, and went with rapid steps toward the door. But at the door she stopped as if her conscience reproached her for having in her joy left the child too soon, and she glanced round. The nurse with raised elbows was lifting the infant over the rail of his cot.\n\n\u201cGo, ma\u2019am! Don\u2019t worry, go!\u201d she whispered, smiling, with the kind of familiarity that grows up between a nurse and her mistress.\n\nNat\u00e1sha ran with light footsteps to the anteroom.\n\nDen\u00edsov, who had come out of the study into the dancing room with his pipe, now for the first time recognized the old Nat\u00e1sha. A flood of brilliant, joyful light poured from her transfigured face.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s come!\u201d she exclaimed as she ran past, and Den\u00edsov felt that he too was delighted that Pierre, whom he did not much care for, had returned.\n\nOn reaching the vestibule Nat\u00e1sha saw a tall figure in a fur coat unwinding his scarf. \u201cIt\u2019s he! It\u2019s really he! He has come!\u201d she said to herself, and rushing at him embraced him, pressed his head to her breast, and then pushed him back and gazed at his ruddy, happy face, covered with hoarfrost. \u201cYes, it is he, happy and contented....\u201d\n\nThen all at once she remembered the tortures of suspense she had experienced for the last fortnight, and the joy that had lit up her face vanished; she frowned and overwhelmed Pierre with a torrent of reproaches and angry words.\n\n\u201cYes, it\u2019s all very well for you. You are pleased, you\u2019ve had a good time.... But what about me? You might at least have shown consideration for the children. I am nursing and my milk was spoiled.... P\u00e9tya was at death\u2019s door. But you were enjoying yourself. Yes, enjoying...\u201d\n\nPierre knew he was not to blame, for he could not have come sooner; he knew this outburst was unseemly and would blow over in a minute or two; above all he knew that he himself was bright and happy. He wanted to smile but dared not even think of doing so. He made a piteous, frightened face and bent down.\n\n\u201cI could not, on my honor. But how is P\u00e9tya?\u201d\n\n\u201cAll right now. Come along! I wonder you\u2019re not ashamed! If only you could see what I was like without you, how I suffered!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou are well?\u201d\n\n\u201cCome, come!\u201d she said, not letting go of his arm. And they went to their rooms.\n\nWhen Nicholas and his wife came to look for Pierre he was in the nursery holding his baby son, who was again awake, on his huge right palm and dandling him. A blissful bright smile was fixed on the baby\u2019s broad face with its toothless open mouth. The storm was long since over and there was bright, joyous sunshine on Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s face as she gazed tenderly at her husband and child.\n\n\u201cAnd have you talked everything well over with Prince Theodore?\u201d she asked.\n\n\u201cYes, capitally.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou see, he holds it up.\u201d (She meant the baby\u2019s head.) \u201cBut how he did frighten me... You\u2019ve seen the princess? Is it true she\u2019s in love with that...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, just fancy...\u201d\n\nAt that moment Nicholas and Countess Mary came in. Pierre with the baby on his hand stooped, kissed them, and replied to their inquiries. But in spite of much that was interesting and had to be discussed, the baby with the little cap on its unsteady head evidently absorbed all his attention.\n\n\u201cHow sweet!\u201d said Countess Mary, looking at and playing with the baby. \u201cNow, Nicholas,\u201d she added, turning to her husband, \u201cI can\u2019t understand how it is you don\u2019t see the charm of these delicious marvels.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t and can\u2019t,\u201d replied Nicholas, looking coldly at the baby. \u201cA lump of flesh. Come along, Pierre!\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd yet he\u2019s such an affectionate father,\u201d said Countess Mary, vindicating her husband, \u201cbut only after they are a year old or so...\u201d\n\n\u201cNow, Pierre nurses them splendidly,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cHe says his hand is just made for a baby\u2019s seat. Just look!\u201d\n\n\u201cOnly not for this...\u201d Pierre suddenly exclaimed with a laugh, and shifting the baby he gave him to the nurse.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nAs in every large household, there were at Bald Hills several perfectly distinct worlds which merged into one harmonious whole, though each retained its own peculiarities and made concessions to the others. Every event, joyful or sad, that took place in that house was important to all these worlds, but each had its own special reasons to rejoice or grieve over that occurrence independently of the others.\n\nFor instance, Pierre\u2019s return was a joyful and important event and they all felt it to be so.\n\nThe servants\u2014the most reliable judges of their masters because they judge not by their conversation or expressions of feeling but by their acts and way of life\u2014were glad of Pierre\u2019s return because they knew that when he was there Count Nicholas would cease going every day to attend to the estate, and would be in better spirits and temper, and also because they would all receive handsome presents for the holidays.\n\nThe children and their governesses were glad of Pierre\u2019s return because no one else drew them into the social life of the household as he did. He alone could play on the clavichord that \u00e9cossaise (his only piece) to which, as he said, all possible dances could be danced, and they felt sure he had brought presents for them all.\n\nYoung Nicholas, now a slim lad of fifteen, delicate and intelligent, with curly light-brown hair and beautiful eyes, was delighted because Uncle Pierre as he called him was the object of his rapturous and passionate affection. No one had instilled into him this love for Pierre whom he saw only occasionally. Countess Mary who had brought him up had done her utmost to make him love her husband as she loved him, and little Nicholas did love his uncle, but loved him with just a shade of contempt. Pierre, however, he adored. He did not want to be an hussar or a Knight of St. George like his uncle Nicholas; he wanted to be learned, wise, and kind like Pierre. In Pierre\u2019s presence his face always shone with pleasure and he flushed and was breathless when Pierre spoke to him. He did not miss a single word he uttered, and would afterwards, with Dessalles or by himself, recall and reconsider the meaning of everything Pierre had said. Pierre\u2019s past life and his unhappiness prior to 1812 (of which young Nicholas had formed a vague poetic picture from some words he had overheard), his adventures in Moscow, his captivity, Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev (of whom he had heard from Pierre), his love for Nat\u00e1sha (of whom the lad was also particularly fond), and especially Pierre\u2019s friendship with the father whom Nicholas could not remember\u2014all this made Pierre in his eyes a hero and a saint.\n\nFrom broken remarks about Nat\u00e1sha and his father, from the emotion with which Pierre spoke of that dead father, and from the careful, reverent tenderness with which Nat\u00e1sha spoke of him, the boy, who was only just beginning to guess what love is, derived the notion that his father had loved Nat\u00e1sha and when dying had left her to his friend. But the father whom the boy did not remember appeared to him a divinity who could not be pictured, and of whom he never thought without a swelling heart and tears of sadness and rapture. So the boy also was happy that Pierre had arrived.\n\nThe guests welcomed Pierre because he always helped to enliven and unite any company he was in.\n\nThe grown-up members of the family, not to mention his wife, were pleased to have back a friend whose presence made life run more smoothly and peacefully.\n\nThe old ladies were pleased with the presents he brought them, and especially that Nat\u00e1sha would now be herself again.\n\nPierre felt the different outlooks of these various worlds and made haste to satisfy all their expectations.\n\nThough the most absent-minded and forgetful of men, Pierre, with the aid of a list his wife drew up, had now bought everything, not forgetting his mother\u2014and brother-in-law\u2019s commissions, nor the dress material for a present to Bel\u00f3va, nor toys for his wife\u2019s nephews. In the early days of his marriage it had seemed strange to him that his wife should expect him not to forget to procure all the things he undertook to buy, and he had been taken aback by her serious annoyance when on his first trip he forgot everything. But in time he grew used to this demand. Knowing that Nat\u00e1sha asked nothing for herself, and gave him commissions for others only when he himself had offered to undertake them, he now found an unexpected and childlike pleasure in this purchase of presents for everyone in the house, and never forgot anything. If he now incurred Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s censure it was only for buying too many and too expensive things. To her other defects (as most people thought them, but which to Pierre were qualities) of untidiness and neglect of herself, she now added stinginess.\n\nFrom the time that Pierre began life as a family man on a footing entailing heavy expenditure, he had noticed to his surprise that he spent only half as much as before, and that his affairs\u2014which had been in disorder of late, chiefly because of his first wife\u2019s debts\u2014had begun to improve.\n\nLife was cheaper because it was circumscribed: that most expensive luxury, the kind of life that can be changed at any moment, was no longer his nor did he wish for it. He felt that his way of life had now been settled once for all till death and that to change it was not in his power, and so that way of life proved economical.\n\nWith a merry, smiling face Pierre was sorting his purchases.\n\n\u201cWhat do you think of this?\u201d said he, unrolling a piece of stuff like a shopman.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, who was sitting opposite to him with her eldest daughter on her lap, turned her sparkling eyes swiftly from her husband to the things he showed her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s for Bel\u00f3va? Excellent!\u201d She felt the quality of the material. \u201cIt was a ruble an arshin, I suppose?\u201d\n\nPierre told her the price.\n\n\u201cToo dear!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha remarked. \u201cHow pleased the children will be and Mamma too! Only you need not have bought me this,\u201d she added, unable to suppress a smile as she gazed admiringly at a gold comb set with pearls, of a kind then just coming into fashion.\n\n\u201cAd\u00e8le tempted me: she kept on telling me to buy it,\u201d returned Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhen am I to wear it?\u201d and Nat\u00e1sha stuck it in her coil of hair. \u201cWhen I take little M\u00e1sha into society? Perhaps they will be fashionable again by then. Well, let\u2019s go now.\u201d\n\nAnd collecting the presents they went first to the nursery and then to the old countess\u2019 rooms.\n\nThe countess was sitting with her companion Bel\u00f3va, playing grand-patience as usual, when Pierre and Nat\u00e1sha came into the drawing room with parcels under their arms.\n\nThe countess was now over sixty, was quite gray, and wore a cap with a frill that surrounded her face. Her face had shriveled, her upper lip had sunk in, and her eyes were dim.\n\nAfter the deaths of her son and husband in such rapid succession, she felt herself a being accidentally forgotten in this world and left without aim or object for her existence. She ate, drank, slept, or kept awake, but did not live. Life gave her no new impressions. She wanted nothing from life but tranquillity, and that tranquillity only death could give her. But until death came she had to go on living, that is, to use her vital forces. A peculiarity one sees in very young children and very old people was particularly evident in her. Her life had no external aims\u2014only a need to exercise her various functions and inclinations was apparent. She had to eat, sleep, think, speak, weep, work, give vent to her anger, and so on, merely because she had a stomach, a brain, muscles, nerves, and a liver. She did these things not under any external impulse as people in the full vigor of life do, when behind the purpose for which they strive that of exercising their functions remains unnoticed. She talked only because she physically needed to exercise her tongue and lungs. She cried as a child does, because her nose had to be cleared, and so on. What for people in their full vigor is an aim was for her evidently merely a pretext.\n\nThus in the morning\u2014especially if she had eaten anything rich the day before\u2014she felt a need of being angry and would choose as the handiest pretext Bel\u00f3va\u2019s deafness.\n\nShe would begin to say something to her in a low tone from the other end of the room.\n\n\u201cIt seems a little warmer today, my dear,\u201d she would murmur.\n\nAnd when Bel\u00f3va replied: \u201cOh yes, they\u2019ve come,\u201d she would mutter angrily: \u201cO Lord! How stupid and deaf she is!\u201d\n\nAnother pretext would be her snuff, which would seem too dry or too damp or not rubbed fine enough. After these fits of irritability her face would grow yellow, and her maids knew by infallible symptoms when Bel\u00f3va would again be deaf, the snuff damp, and the countess\u2019 face yellow. Just as she needed to work off her spleen so she had sometimes to exercise her still-existing faculty of thinking\u2014and the pretext for that was a game of patience. When she needed to cry, the deceased count would be the pretext. When she wanted to be agitated, Nicholas and his health would be the pretext, and when she felt a need to speak spitefully, the pretext would be Countess Mary. When her vocal organs needed exercise, which was usually toward seven o\u2019clock when she had had an after-dinner rest in a darkened room, the pretext would be the retelling of the same stories over and over again to the same audience.\n\nThe old lady\u2019s condition was understood by the whole household though no one ever spoke of it, and they all made every possible effort to satisfy her needs. Only by a rare glance exchanged with a sad smile between Nicholas, Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha, and Countess Mary was the common understanding of her condition expressed.\n\nBut those glances expressed something more: they said that she had played her part in life, that what they now saw was not her whole self, that we must all become like her, and that they were glad to yield to her, to restrain themselves for this once precious being formerly as full of life as themselves, but now so much to be pitied. \u201cMemento mori,\u201d said these glances.\n\nOnly the really heartless, the stupid ones of that household, and the little children failed to understand this and avoided her.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIII\n\nWhen Pierre and his wife entered the drawing room the countess was in one of her customary states in which she needed the mental exertion of playing patience, and so\u2014though by force of habit she greeted him with the words she always used when Pierre or her son returned after an absence: \u201cHigh time, my dear, high time! We were all weary of waiting for you. Well, thank God!\u201d and received her presents with another customary remark: \u201cIt\u2019s not the gift that\u2019s precious, my dear, but that you give it to me, an old woman...\u201d\u2014yet it was evident that she was not pleased by Pierre\u2019s arrival at that moment when it diverted her attention from the unfinished game.\n\nShe finished her game of patience and only then examined the presents. They consisted of a box for cards, of splendid workmanship, a bright-blue S\u00e8vres tea cup with shepherdesses depicted on it and with a lid, and a gold snuffbox with the count\u2019s portrait on the lid which Pierre had had done by a miniaturist in Petersburg. The countess had long wished for such a box, but as she did not want to cry just then she glanced indifferently at the portrait and gave her attention chiefly to the box for cards.\n\n\u201cThank you, my dear, you have cheered me up,\u201d said she as she always did. \u201cBut best of all you have brought yourself back\u2014for I never saw anything like it, you ought to give your wife a scolding! What are we to do with her? She is like a mad woman when you are away. Doesn\u2019t see anything, doesn\u2019t remember anything,\u201d she went on, repeating her usual phrases. \u201cLook, Anna Timof\u00e9evna,\u201d she added to her companion, \u201csee what a box for cards my son has brought us!\u201d\n\nBel\u00f3va admired the presents and was delighted with her dress material.\n\nThough Pierre, Nat\u00e1sha, Nicholas, Countess Mary, and Den\u00edsov had much to talk about that they could not discuss before the old countess\u2014not that anything was hidden from her, but because she had dropped so far behindhand in many things that had they begun to converse in her presence they would have had to answer inopportune questions and to repeat what they had already told her many times: that so-and-so was dead and so-and-so was married, which she would again be unable to remember\u2014yet they sat at tea round the samovar in the drawing room from habit, and Pierre answered the countess\u2019 questions as to whether Prince Vas\u00edli had aged and whether Countess Mary Alex\u00e9evna had sent greetings and still thought of them, and other matters that interested no one and to which she herself was indifferent.\n\nConversation of this kind, interesting to no one yet unavoidable, continued all through teatime. All the grown-up members of the family were assembled near the round tea table at which S\u00f3nya presided beside the samovar. The children with their tutors and governesses had had tea and their voices were audible from the next room. At tea all sat in their accustomed places: Nicholas beside the stove at a small table where his tea was handed to him; M\u00edlka, the old gray borzoi bitch (daughter of the first M\u00edlka), with a quite gray face and large black eyes that seemed more prominent than ever, lay on the armchair beside him; Den\u00edsov, whose curly hair, mustache, and whiskers had turned half gray, sat beside countess Mary with his general\u2019s tunic unbuttoned; Pierre sat between his wife and the old countess. He spoke of what he knew might interest the old lady and that she could understand. He told her of external social events and of the people who had formed the circle of her contemporaries and had once been a real, living, and distinct group, but who were now for the most part scattered about the world and like herself were garnering the last ears of the harvests they had sown in earlier years. But to the old countess those contemporaries of hers seemed to be the only serious and real society. Nat\u00e1sha saw by Pierre\u2019s animation that his visit had been interesting and that he had much to tell them but dare not say it before the old countess. Den\u00edsov, not being a member of the family, did not understand Pierre\u2019s caution and being, as a malcontent, much interested in what was occurring in Petersburg, kept urging Pierre to tell them about what had happened in the Sem\u00ebnovsk regiment, then about Arakch\u00e9ev, and then about the Bible Society. Once or twice Pierre was carried away and began to speak of these things, but Nicholas and Nat\u00e1sha always brought him back to the health of Prince Iv\u00e1n and Countess Mary Alex\u00e9evna.\n\n\u201cWell, and all this idiocy\u2014Gossner and Tat\u00e1winova?\u201d Den\u00edsov asked. \u201cIs that weally still going on?\u201d\n\n\u201cGoing on?\u201d Pierre exclaimed. \u201cWhy more than ever! The Bible Society is the whole government now!\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is that, mon cher ami?\u201d asked the countess, who had finished her tea and evidently needed a pretext for being angry after her meal. \u201cWhat are you saying about the government? I don\u2019t understand.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know, Maman,\u201d Nicholas interposed, knowing how to translate things into his mother\u2019s language, \u201cPrince Alexander Gol\u00edtsyn has founded a society and in consequence has great influence, they say.\u201d\n\n\u201cArakch\u00e9ev and Gol\u00edtsyn,\u201d incautiously remarked Pierre, \u201care now the whole government! And what a government! They see treason everywhere and are afraid of everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, and how is Prince Alexander to blame? He is a most estimable man. I used to meet him at Mary Ant\u00f3novna\u2019s,\u201d said the countess in an offended tone; and still more offended that they all remained silent, she went on: \u201cNowadays everyone finds fault. A Gospel Society! Well, and what harm is there in that?\u201d and she rose (everybody else got up too) and with a severe expression sailed back to her table in the sitting room.\n\nThe melancholy silence that followed was broken by the sounds of the children\u2019s voices and laughter from the next room. Evidently some jolly excitement was going on there.\n\n\u201cFinished, finished!\u201d little Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s gleeful yell rose above them all.\n\nPierre exchanged glances with Countess Mary and Nicholas (Nat\u00e1sha he never lost sight of) and smiled happily.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s delightful music!\u201d said he.\n\n\u201cIt means that Anna Mak\u00e1rovna has finished her stocking,\u201d said Countess Mary.\n\n\u201cOh, I\u2019ll go and see,\u201d said Pierre, jumping up. \u201cYou know,\u201d he added, stopping at the door, \u201cwhy I\u2019m especially fond of that music? It is always the first thing that tells me all is well. When I was driving here today, the nearer I got to the house the more anxious I grew. As I entered the anteroom I heard Andr\u00fasha\u2019s peals of laughter and that meant that all was well.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know! I know that feeling,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cBut I mustn\u2019t go there\u2014those stockings are to be a surprise for me.\u201d\n\nPierre went to the children, and the shouting and laughter grew still louder.\n\n\u201cCome, Anna Mak\u00e1rovna,\u201d Pierre\u2019s voice was heard saying, \u201ccome here into the middle of the room and at the word of command, \u2018One, two,\u2019 and when I say \u2018three\u2019... You stand here, and you in my arms\u2014well now! One, two!...\u201d said Pierre, and a silence followed: \u201cthree!\u201d and a rapturously breathless cry of children\u2019s voices filled the room. \u201cTwo, two!\u201d they shouted.\n\nThis meant two stockings, which by a secret process known only to herself Anna Mak\u00e1rovna used to knit at the same time on the same needles, and which, when they were ready, she always triumphantly drew, one out of the other, in the children\u2019s presence.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XIV\n\nSoon after this the children came in to say good night. They kissed everyone, the tutors and governesses made their bows, and they went out. Only young Nicholas and his tutor remained. Dessalles whispered to the boy to come downstairs.\n\n\u201cNo, Monsieur Dessalles, I will ask my aunt to let me stay,\u201d replied Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski also in a whisper.\n\n\u201cMa tante, please let me stay,\u201d said he, going up to his aunt.\n\nHis face expressed entreaty, agitation, and ecstasy. Countess Mary glanced at him and turned to Pierre.\n\n\u201cWhen you are here he can\u2019t tear himself away,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cI will bring him to you directly, Monsieur Dessalles. Good night!\u201d said Pierre, giving his hand to the Swiss tutor, and he turned to young Nicholas with a smile. \u201cYou and I haven\u2019t seen anything of one another yet.... How like he is growing, Mary!\u201d he added, addressing Countess Mary.\n\n\u201cLike my father?\u201d asked the boy, flushing crimson and looking up at Pierre with bright, ecstatic eyes.\n\nPierre nodded, and went on with what he had been saying when the children had interrupted. Countess Mary sat down doing woolwork; Nat\u00e1sha did not take her eyes off her husband. Nicholas and Den\u00edsov rose, asked for their pipes, smoked, went to fetch more tea from S\u00f3nya\u2014who sat weary but resolute at the samovar\u2014and questioned Pierre. The curly-headed, delicate boy sat with shining eyes unnoticed in a corner, starting every now and then and muttering something to himself, and evidently experiencing a new and powerful emotion as he turned his curly head, with his thin neck exposed by his turn-down collar, toward the place where Pierre sat.\n\nThe conversation turned on the contemporary gossip about those in power, in which most people see the chief interest of home politics. Den\u00edsov, dissatisfied with the government on account of his own disappointments in the service, heard with pleasure of the things done in Petersburg which seemed to him stupid, and made forcible and sharp comments on what Pierre told them.\n\n\u201cOne used to have to be a German\u2014now one must dance with Tat\u00e1winova and Madame Kw\u00fcdener, and wead Ecka\u2019tshausen and the bwethwen. Oh, they should let that fine fellow Bonaparte loose\u2014he\u2019d knock all this nonsense out of them! Fancy giving the command of the Sem\u00ebnov wegiment to a fellow like that Schwa\u2019tz!\u201d he cried.\n\nNicholas, though free from Den\u00edsov\u2019s readiness to find fault with everything, also thought that discussion of the government was a very serious and weighty matter, and the fact that A had been appointed Minister of This and B Governor General of That, and that the Emperor had said so-and-so and this minister so-and-so, seemed to him very important. And so he thought it necessary to take an interest in these things and to question Pierre. The questions put by these two kept the conversation from changing its ordinary character of gossip about the higher government circles.\n\nBut Nat\u00e1sha, knowing all her husband\u2019s ways and ideas, saw that he had long been wishing but had been unable to divert the conversation to another channel and express his own deeply felt idea for the sake of which he had gone to Petersburg to consult with his new friend Prince Theodore, and she helped him by asking how his affairs with Prince Theodore had gone.\n\n\u201cWhat was it about?\u201d asked Nicholas.\n\n\u201cAlways the same thing,\u201d said Pierre, looking round at his listeners. \u201cEverybody sees that things are going so badly that they cannot be allowed to go on so and that it is the duty of all decent men to counteract it as far as they can.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat can decent men do?\u201d Nicholas inquired, frowning slightly. \u201cWhat can be done?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, this...\u201d\n\n\u201cCome into my study,\u201d said Nicholas.\n\nNat\u00e1sha, who had long expected to be fetched to nurse her baby, now heard the nurse calling her and went to the nursery. Countess Mary followed her. The men went into the study and little Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski followed them unnoticed by his uncle and sat down at the writing table in a shady corner by the window.\n\n\u201cWell, what would you do?\u201d asked Den\u00edsov.\n\n\u201cAlways some fantastic schemes,\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWhy this,\u201d began Pierre, not sitting down but pacing the room, sometimes stopping short, gesticulating, and lisping: \u201cthe position in Petersburg is this: the Emperor does not look into anything. He has abandoned himself altogether to this mysticism\u201d (Pierre could not tolerate mysticism in anyone now). \u201cHe seeks only for peace, and only these people sans foi ni loi can give it him\u2014people who recklessly hack at and strangle everything\u2014Magn\u00edtski, Arakch\u00e9ev, and tutti quanti.... You will agree that if you did not look after your estates yourself but only wanted a quiet life, the harsher your steward was the more readily your object might be attained,\u201d he said to Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWell, what does that lead up to?\u201d said Nicholas.\n\n\u201cWell, everything is going to ruin! Robbery in the law courts, in the army nothing but flogging, drilling, and Military Settlements; the people are tortured, enlightenment is suppressed. All that is young and honest is crushed! Everyone sees that this cannot go on. Everything is strained to such a degree that it will certainly break,\u201d said Pierre (as those who examine the actions of any government have always said since governments began). \u201cI told them just one thing in Petersburg.\u201d\n\n\u201cTold whom?\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, you know whom,\u201d said Pierre, with a meaning glance from under his brows. \u201cPrince Theodore and all those. To encourage culture and philanthropy is all very well of course. The aim is excellent but in the present circumstances something else is needed.\u201d\n\nAt that moment Nicholas noticed the presence of his nephew. His face darkened and he went up to the boy.\n\n\u201cWhy are you here?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Let him be,\u201d said Pierre, taking Nicholas by the arm and continuing. \u201cThat is not enough, I told them. Something else is needed. When you stand expecting the overstrained string to snap at any moment, when everyone is expecting the inevitable catastrophe, as many as possible must join hands as closely as they can to withstand the general calamity. Everything that is young and strong is being enticed away and depraved. One is lured by women, another by honors, a third by ambition or money, and they go over to that camp. No independent men, such as you or I, are left. What I say is widen the scope of our society, let the mot d\u2019ordre be not virtue alone but independence and action as well!\u201d\n\nNicholas, who had left his nephew, irritably pushed up an armchair, sat down in it, and listened to Pierre, coughing discontentedly and frowning more and more.\n\n\u201cBut action with what aim?\u201d he cried. \u201cAnd what position will you adopt toward the government?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy, the position of assistants. The society need not be secret if the government allows it. Not merely is it not hostile to government, but it is a society of true conservatives\u2014a society of gentlemen in the full meaning of that word. It is only to prevent some Pugach\u00ebv or other from killing my children and yours, and Arakch\u00e9ev from sending me off to some Military Settlement. We join hands only for the public welfare and the general safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, but it\u2019s a secret society and therefore a hostile and harmful one which can only cause harm.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy? Did the Tugendbund which saved Europe\u201d (they did not then venture to suggest that Russia had saved Europe) \u201cdo any harm? The Tugendbund is an alliance of virtue: it is love, mutual help... it is what Christ preached on the Cross.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha, who had come in during the conversation, looked joyfully at her husband. It was not what he was saying that pleased her\u2014that did not even interest her, for it seemed to her that was all extremely simple and that she had known it a long time (it seemed so to her because she knew that it sprang from Pierre\u2019s whole soul), but it was his animated and enthusiastic appearance that made her glad.\n\nThe boy with the thin neck stretching out from the turn-down collar\u2014whom everyone had forgotten\u2014gazed at Pierre with even greater and more rapturous joy. Every word of Pierre\u2019s burned into his heart, and with a nervous movement of his fingers he unconsciously broke the sealing wax and quill pens his hands came upon on his uncle\u2019s table.\n\n\u201cIt is not at all what you suppose; but that is what the German Tugendbund was, and what I am proposing.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, my fwiend! The Tugendbund is all vewy well for the sausage eaters, but I don\u2019t understand it and can\u2019t even pwonounce it,\u201d interposed Den\u00edsov in a loud and resolute voice. \u201cI agwee that evewything here is wotten and howwible, but the Tugendbund I don\u2019t understand. If we\u2019re not satisfied, let us have a bunt of our own. That\u2019s all wight. Je suis vot\u2019e homme!\u201d\n\nPierre smiled, Nat\u00e1sha began to laugh, but Nicholas knitted his brows still more and began proving to Pierre that there was no prospect of any great change and that all the danger he spoke of existed only in his imagination. Pierre maintained the contrary, and as his mental faculties were greater and more resourceful, Nicholas felt himself cornered. This made him still angrier, for he was fully convinced, not by reasoning but by something within him stronger than reason, of the justice of his opinion.\n\n\u201cI will tell you this,\u201d he said, rising and trying with nervously twitching fingers to prop up his pipe in a corner, but finally abandoning the attempt. \u201cI can\u2019t prove it to you. You say that everything here is rotten and that an overthrow is coming: I don\u2019t see it. But you also say that our oath of allegiance is a conditional matter, and to that I reply: \u2018You are my best friend, as you know, but if you formed a secret society and began working against the government\u2014be it what it may\u2014I know it is my duty to obey the government. And if Arakch\u00e9ev ordered me to lead a squadron against you and cut you down, I should not hesitate an instant, but should do it.\u2019 And you may argue about that as you like!\u201d\n\nAn awkward silence followed these words. Nat\u00e1sha was the first to speak, defending her husband and attacking her brother. Her defense was weak and inapt but she attained her object. The conversation was resumed, and no longer in the unpleasantly hostile tone of Nicholas\u2019 last remark.\n\nWhen they all got up to go in to supper, little Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski went up to Pierre, pale and with shining, radiant eyes.\n\n\u201cUncle Pierre, you... no... If Papa were alive... would he agree with you?\u201d he asked.\n\nAnd Pierre suddenly realized what a special, independent, complex, and powerful process of thought and feeling must have been going on in this boy during that conversation, and remembering all he had said he regretted that the lad should have heard him. He had, however, to give him an answer.\n\n\u201cYes, I think so,\u201d he said reluctantly, and left the study.\n\nThe lad looked down and seemed now for the first time to notice what he had done to the things on the table. He flushed and went up to Nicholas.\n\n\u201cUncle, forgive me, I did that... unintentionally,\u201d he said, pointing to the broken sealing wax and pens.\n\nNicholas started angrily.\n\n\u201cAll right, all right,\u201d he said, throwing the bits under the table.\n\nAnd evidently suppressing his vexation with difficulty, he turned away from the boy.\n\n\u201cYou ought not to have been here at all,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XV\n\nThe conversation at supper was not about politics or societies, but turned on the subject Nicholas liked best\u2014recollections of 1812. Den\u00edsov started these and Pierre was particularly agreeable and amusing about them. The family separated on the most friendly terms.\n\nAfter supper Nicholas, having undressed in his study and given instructions to the steward who had been waiting for him, went to the bedroom in his dressing gown, where he found his wife still at her table, writing.\n\n\u201cWhat are you writing, Mary?\u201d Nicholas asked.\n\nCountess Mary blushed. She was afraid that what she was writing would not be understood or approved by her husband.\n\nShe had wanted to conceal what she was writing from him, but at the same time was glad he had surprised her at it and that she would now have to tell him.\n\n\u201cA diary, Nicholas,\u201d she replied, handing him a blue exercise book filled with her firm, bold writing.\n\n\u201cA diary?\u201d Nicholas repeated with a shade of irony, and he took up the book.\n\nIt was in French.\n\n\nDecember 4. Today when Andr\u00fasha (her eldest boy) woke up he did not wish to dress and Mademoiselle Louise sent for me. He was naughty and obstinate. I tried threats, but he only grew angrier. Then I took the matter in hand: I left him alone and began with nurse\u2019s help to get the other children up, telling him that I did not love him. For a long time he was silent, as if astonished, then he jumped out of bed, ran to me in his shirt, and sobbed so that I could not calm him for a long time. It was plain that what troubled him most was that he had grieved me. Afterwards in the evening when I gave him his ticket, he again began crying piteously and kissing me. One can do anything with him by tenderness.\n\n\n\u201cWhat is a \u2018ticket\u2019?\u201d Nicholas inquired.\n\n\u201cI have begun giving the elder ones marks every evening, showing how they have behaved.\u201d\n\nNicholas looked into the radiant eyes that were gazing at him, and continued to turn over the pages and read. In the diary was set down everything in the children\u2019s lives that seemed noteworthy to their mother as showing their characters or suggesting general reflections on educational methods. They were for the most part quite insignificant trifles, but did not seem so to the mother or to the father either, now that he read this diary about his children for the first time.\n\nUnder the date \u201c5\u201d was entered:\n\n\nM\u00edtya was naughty at table. Papa said he was to have no pudding. He had none, but looked so unhappily and greedily at the others while they were eating! I think that punishment by depriving children of sweets only develops their greediness. Must tell Nicholas this.\n\nNicholas put down the book and looked at his wife. The radiant eyes gazed at him questioningly: would he approve or disapprove of her diary? There could be no doubt not only of his approval but also of his admiration for his wife.\n\nPerhaps it need not be done so pedantically, thought Nicholas, or even done at all, but this untiring, continual spiritual effort of which the sole aim was the children\u2019s moral welfare delighted him. Had Nicholas been able to analyze his feelings he would have found that his steady, tender, and proud love of his wife rested on his feeling of wonder at her spirituality and at the lofty moral world, almost beyond his reach, in which she had her being.\n\nHe was proud of her intelligence and goodness, recognized his own insignificance beside her in the spiritual world, and rejoiced all the more that she with such a soul not only belonged to him but was part of himself.\n\n\u201cI quite, quite approve, my dearest!\u201d said he with a significant look, and after a short pause he added: \u201cAnd I behaved badly today. You weren\u2019t in the study. We began disputing\u2014Pierre and I\u2014and I lost my temper. But he is impossible: such a child! I don\u2019t know what would become of him if Nat\u00e1sha didn\u2019t keep him in hand.... Have you any idea why he went to Petersburg? They have formed...\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I know,\u201d said Countess Mary. \u201cNat\u00e1sha told me.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, then, you know,\u201d Nicholas went on, growing hot at the mere recollection of their discussion, \u201che wanted to convince me that it is every honest man\u2019s duty to go against the government, and that the oath of allegiance and duty... I am sorry you weren\u2019t there. They all fell on me\u2014Den\u00edsov and Nat\u00e1sha... Nat\u00e1sha is absurd. How she rules over him! And yet there need only be a discussion and she has no words of her own but only repeats his sayings...\u201d added Nicholas, yielding to that irresistible inclination which tempts us to judge those nearest and dearest to us. He forgot that what he was saying about Nat\u00e1sha could have been applied word for word to himself in relation to his wife.\n\n\u201cYes, I have noticed that,\u201d said Countess Mary.\n\n\u201cWhen I told him that duty and the oath were above everything, he started proving goodness knows what! A pity you were not there\u2014what would you have said?\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I see it you were quite right, and I told Nat\u00e1sha so. Pierre says everybody is suffering, tortured, and being corrupted, and that it is our duty to help our neighbor. Of course he is right there,\u201d said Countess Mary, \u201cbut he forgets that we have other duties nearer to us, duties indicated to us by God Himself, and that though we might expose ourselves to risks we must not risk our children.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, that\u2019s it! That\u2019s just what I said to him,\u201d put in Nicholas, who fancied he really had said it. \u201cBut they insisted on their own view: love of one\u2019s neighbor and Christianity\u2014and all this in the presence of young Nicholas, who had gone into my study and broke all my things.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, Nicholas, do you know I am often troubled about little Nicholas,\u201d said Countess Mary. \u201cHe is such an exceptional boy. I am afraid I neglect him in favor of my own: we all have children and relations while he has no one. He is constantly alone with his thoughts.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I don\u2019t think you need reproach yourself on his account. All that the fondest mother could do for her son you have done and are doing for him, and of course I am glad of it. He is a fine lad, a fine lad! This evening he listened to Pierre in a sort of trance, and fancy\u2014as we were going in to supper I looked and he had broken everything on my table to bits, and he told me of it himself at once! I never knew him to tell an untruth. A fine lad, a fine lad!\u201d repeated Nicholas, who at heart was not fond of Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski but was always anxious to recognize that he was a fine lad.\n\n\u201cStill, I am not the same as his own mother,\u201d said Countess Mary. \u201cI feel I am not the same and it troubles me. A wonderful boy, but I am dreadfully afraid for him. It would be good for him to have companions.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell it won\u2019t be for long. Next summer I\u2019ll take him to Petersburg,\u201d said Nicholas. \u201cYes, Pierre always was a dreamer and always will be,\u201d he continued, returning to the talk in the study which had evidently disturbed him. \u201cWell, what business is it of mine what goes on there\u2014whether Arakch\u00e9ev is bad, and all that? What business was it of mine when I married and was so deep in debt that I was threatened with prison, and had a mother who could not see or understand it? And then there are you and the children and our affairs. Is it for my own pleasure that I am at the farm or in the office from morning to night? No, but I know I must work to comfort my mother, to repay you, and not to leave the children such beggars as I was.\u201d\n\nCountess Mary wanted to tell him that man does not live by bread alone and that he attached too much importance to these matters. But she knew she must not say this and that it would be useless to do so. She only took his hand and kissed it. He took this as a sign of approval and a confirmation of his thoughts, and after a few minutes\u2019 reflection continued to think aloud.\n\n\u201cYou know, Mary, today Elias Mitrof\u00e1nych\u201d (this was his overseer) \u201ccame back from the Tamb\u00f3v estate and told me they are already offering eighty thousand rubles for the forest.\u201d\n\nAnd with an eager face Nicholas began to speak of the possibility of repurchasing Otr\u00e1dnoe before long, and added: \u201cAnother ten years of life and I shall leave the children... in an excellent position.\u201d\n\nCountess Mary listened to her husband and understood all that he told her. She knew that when he thought aloud in this way he would sometimes ask her what he had been saying, and be vexed if he noticed that she had been thinking about something else. But she had to force herself to attend, for what he was saying did not interest her at all. She looked at him and did not think, but felt, about something different. She felt a submissive tender love for this man who would never understand all that she understood, and this seemed to make her love for him still stronger and added a touch of passionate tenderness. Besides this feeling which absorbed her altogether and hindered her from following the details of her husband\u2019s plans, thoughts that had no connection with what he was saying flitted through her mind. She thought of her nephew. Her husband\u2019s account of the boy\u2019s agitation while Pierre was speaking struck her forcibly, and various traits of his gentle, sensitive character recurred to her mind; and while thinking of her nephew she thought also of her own children. She did not compare them with him, but compared her feeling for them with her feeling for him, and felt with regret that there was something lacking in her feeling for young Nicholas.\n\nSometimes it seemed to her that this difference arose from the difference in their ages, but she felt herself to blame toward him and promised in her heart to do better and to accomplish the impossible\u2014in this life to love her husband, her children, little Nicholas, and all her neighbors, as Christ loved mankind. Countess Mary\u2019s soul always strove toward the infinite, the eternal, and the absolute, and could therefore never be at peace. A stern expression of the lofty, secret suffering of a soul burdened by the body appeared on her face. Nicholas gazed at her. \u201cO God! What will become of us if she dies, as I always fear when her face is like that?\u201d thought he, and placing himself before the icon he began to say his evening prayers.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XVI\n\nNat\u00e1sha and Pierre, left alone, also began to talk as only a husband and wife can talk, that is, with extraordinary clearness and rapidity, understanding and expressing each other\u2019s thoughts in ways contrary to all rules of logic, without premises, deductions, or conclusions, and in a quite peculiar way. Nat\u00e1sha was so used to this kind of talk with her husband that for her it was the surest sign of something being wrong between them if Pierre followed a line of logical reasoning. When he began proving anything, or talking argumentatively and calmly and she, led on by his example, began to do the same, she knew that they were on the verge of a quarrel.\n\nFrom the moment they were alone and Nat\u00e1sha came up to him with wide-open happy eyes, and quickly seizing his head pressed it to her bosom, saying: \u201cNow you are all mine, mine! You won\u2019t escape!\u201d\u2014from that moment this conversation began, contrary to all the laws of logic and contrary to them because quite different subjects were talked about at one and the same time. This simultaneous discussion of many topics did not prevent a clear understanding but on the contrary was the surest sign that they fully understood one another.\n\nJust as in a dream when all is uncertain, unreasoning, and contradictory, except the feeling that guides the dream, so in this intercourse contrary to all laws of reason, the words themselves were not consecutive and clear but only the feeling that prompted them.\n\nNat\u00e1sha spoke to Pierre about her brother\u2019s life and doings, of how she had suffered and lacked life during his own absence, and of how she was fonder than ever of Mary, and how Mary was in every way better than herself. In saying this Nat\u00e1sha was sincere in acknowledging Mary\u2019s superiority, but at the same time by saying it she made a demand on Pierre that he should, all the same, prefer her to Mary and to all other women, and that now, especially after having seen many women in Petersburg, he should tell her so afresh.\n\nPierre, answering Nat\u00e1sha\u2019s words, told her how intolerable it had been for him to meet ladies at dinners and balls in Petersburg.\n\n\u201cI have quite lost the knack of talking to ladies,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was simply dull. Besides, I was very busy.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha looked intently at him and went on:\n\n\u201cMary is so splendid,\u201d she said. \u201cHow she understands children! It is as if she saw straight into their souls. Yesterday, for instance, M\u00edtya was naughty...\u201d\n\n\u201cHow like his father he is,\u201d Pierre interjected.\n\nNat\u00e1sha knew why he mentioned M\u00edtya\u2019s likeness to Nicholas: the recollection of his dispute with his brother-in-law was unpleasant and he wanted to know what Nat\u00e1sha thought of it.\n\n\u201cNicholas has the weakness of never agreeing with anything not generally accepted. But I understand that you value what opens up a fresh line,\u201d said she, repeating words Pierre had once uttered.\n\n\u201cNo, the chief point is that to Nicholas ideas and discussions are an amusement\u2014almost a pastime,\u201d said Pierre. \u201cFor instance, he is collecting a library and has made it a rule not to buy a new book till he has read what he had already bought\u2014Sismondi and Rousseau and Montesquieu,\u201d he added with a smile. \u201cYou know how much I...\u201d he began to soften down what he had said; but Nat\u00e1sha interrupted him to show that this was unnecessary.\n\n\u201cSo you say ideas are an amusement to him....\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, and for me nothing else is serious. All the time in Petersburg I saw everyone as in a dream. When I am taken up by a thought, all else is mere amusement.\u201d\n\n\u201cAh, I\u2019m so sorry I wasn\u2019t there when you met the children,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha. \u201cWhich was most delighted? Lisa, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes,\u201d Pierre replied, and went on with what was in his mind. \u201cNicholas says we ought not to think. But I can\u2019t help it. Besides, when I was in Petersburg I felt (I can say this to you) that the whole affair would go to pieces without me\u2014everyone was pulling his own way. But I succeeded in uniting them all; and then my idea is so clear and simple. You see, I don\u2019t say that we ought to oppose this and that. We may be mistaken. What I say is: \u2018Join hands, you who love the right, and let there be but one banner\u2014that of active virtue.\u2019 Prince Serg\u00e9y is a fine fellow and clever.\u201d\n\nNat\u00e1sha would have had no doubt as to the greatness of Pierre\u2019s idea, but one thing disconcerted her. \u201cCan a man so important and necessary to society be also my husband? How did this happen?\u201d She wished to express this doubt to him. \u201cNow who could decide whether he is really cleverer than all the others?\u201d she asked herself, and passed in review all those whom Pierre most respected. Judging by what he had said there was no one he had respected so highly as Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev.\n\n\u201cDo you know what I am thinking about?\u201d she asked. \u201cAbout Plat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev. Would he have approved of you now, do you think?\u201d\n\nPierre was not at all surprised at this question. He understood his wife\u2019s line of thought.\n\n\u201cPlat\u00f3n Karat\u00e1ev?\u201d he repeated, and pondered, evidently sincerely trying to imagine Karat\u00e1ev\u2019s opinion on the subject. \u201cHe would not have understood... yet perhaps he would.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love you awfully!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly said. \u201cAwfully, awfully!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, he would not have approved,\u201d said Pierre, after reflection. \u201cWhat he would have approved of is our family life. He was always so anxious to find seemliness, happiness, and peace in everything, and I should have been proud to let him see us. There now\u2014you talk of my absence, but you wouldn\u2019t believe what a special feeling I have for you after a separation....\u201d\n\n\u201cYes, I should think...\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began.\n\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not that. I never leave off loving you. And one couldn\u2019t love more, but this is something special.... Yes, of course\u2014\u201d he did not finish because their eyes meeting said the rest.\n\n\u201cWhat nonsense it is,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha suddenly exclaimed, \u201cabout honeymoons, and that the greatest happiness is at first! On the contrary, now is the best of all. If only you did not go away! Do you remember how we quarreled? And it was always my fault. Always mine. And what we quarreled about\u2014I don\u2019t even remember!\u201d\n\n\u201cAlways about the same thing,\u201d said Pierre with a smile. \u201cJealo...\u201d\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t say it! I can\u2019t bear it!\u201d Nat\u00e1sha cried, and her eyes glittered coldly and vindictively. \u201cDid you see her?\u201d she added, after a pause.\n\n\u201cNo, and if I had I shouldn\u2019t have recognized her.\u201d\n\nThey were silent for a while.\n\n\u201cOh, do you know? While you were talking in the study I was looking at you,\u201d Nat\u00e1sha began, evidently anxious to disperse the cloud that had come over them. \u201cYou are as like him as two peas\u2014like the boy.\u201d (She meant her little son.) \u201cOh, it\u2019s time to go to him.... The milk\u2019s come.... But I\u2019m sorry to leave you.\u201d\n\nThey were silent for a few seconds. Then suddenly turning to one another at the same time they both began to speak. Pierre began with self-satisfaction and enthusiasm, Nat\u00e1sha with a quiet, happy smile. Having interrupted one another they both stopped to let the other continue.\n\n\u201cNo. What did you say? Go on, go on.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, you go on, I was talking nonsense,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha.\n\nPierre finished what he had begun. It was the sequel to his complacent reflections on his success in Petersburg. At that moment it seemed to him that he was chosen to give a new direction to the whole of Russian society and to the whole world.\n\n\u201cI only wished to say that ideas that have great results are always simple ones. My whole idea is that if vicious people are united and constitute a power, then honest folk must do the same. Now that\u2019s simple enough.\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd what were you going to say?\u201d\n\n\u201cI? Only nonsense.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut all the same?\u201d\n\n\u201cOh nothing, only a trifle,\u201d said Nat\u00e1sha, smiling still more brightly. \u201cI only wanted to tell you about P\u00e9tya: today nurse was coming to take him from me, and he laughed, shut his eyes, and clung to me. I\u2019m sure he thought he was hiding. Awfully sweet! There, now he\u2019s crying. Well, good-by!\u201d and she left the room.\n\n\nMeanwhile downstairs in young Nicholas Bolk\u00f3nski\u2019s bedroom a little lamp was burning as usual. (The boy was afraid of the dark and they could not cure him of it.) Dessalles slept propped up on four pillows and his Roman nose emitted sounds of rhythmic snoring. Little Nicholas, who had just waked up in a cold perspiration, sat up in bed and gazed before him with wide-open eyes. He had awaked from a terrible dream. He had dreamed that he and Uncle Pierre, wearing helmets such as were depicted in his Plutarch, were leading a huge army. The army was made up of white slanting lines that filled the air like the cobwebs that float about in autumn and which Dessalles called les fils de la Vi\u00e8rge. In front was Glory, which was similar to those threads but rather thicker. He and Pierre were borne along lightly and joyously, nearer and nearer to their goal. Suddenly the threads that moved them began to slacken and become entangled and it grew difficult to move. And Uncle Nicholas stood before them in a stern and threatening attitude.\n\n\u201cHave you done this?\u201d he said, pointing to some broken sealing wax and pens. \u201cI loved you, but I have orders from Arakch\u00e9ev and will kill the first of you who moves forward.\u201d Little Nicholas turned to look at Pierre but Pierre was no longer there. In his place was his father\u2014Prince Andrew\u2014and his father had neither shape nor form, but he existed, and when little Nicholas perceived him he grew faint with love: he felt himself powerless, limp, and formless. His father caressed and pitied him. But Uncle Nicholas came nearer and nearer to them. Terror seized young Nicholas and he awoke.\n\n\u201cMy father!\u201d he thought. (Though there were two good portraits of Prince Andrew in the house, Nicholas never imagined him in human form.) \u201cMy father has been with me and caressed me. He approved of me and of Uncle Pierre. Whatever he may tell me, I will do it. Mucius Scaevola burned his hand. Why should not the same sort of thing happen to me? I know they want me to learn. And I will learn. But someday I shall have finished learning, and then I will do something. I only pray God that something may happen to me such as happened to Plutarch\u2019s men, and I will act as they did. I will do better. Everyone shall know me, love me, and be delighted with me!\u201d And suddenly his bosom heaved with sobs and he began to cry.\n\n\u201cAre you ill?\u201d he heard Dessalles\u2019 voice asking.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered Nicholas, and lay back on his pillow.\n\n\u201cHe is good and kind and I am fond of him!\u201d he thought of Dessalles. \u201cBut Uncle Pierre! Oh, what a wonderful man he is! And my father? Oh, Father, Father! Yes, I will do something with which even he would be satisfied....\u201d\n\n\n\nSECOND EPILOGUE\n\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nHistory is the life of nations and of humanity. To seize and put into words, to describe directly the life of humanity or even of a single nation, appears impossible.\n\nThe ancient historians all employed one and the same method to describe and seize the apparently elusive\u2014the life of a people. They described the activity of individuals who ruled the people, and regarded the activity of those men as representing the activity of the whole nation.\n\nThe question: how did individuals make nations act as they wished and by what was the will of these individuals themselves guided? the ancients met by recognizing a divinity which subjected the nations to the will of a chosen man, and guided the will of that chosen man so as to accomplish ends that were predestined.\n\nFor the ancients these questions were solved by a belief in the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs.\n\nModern history, in theory, rejects both these principles.\n\nIt would seem that having rejected the belief of the ancients in man\u2019s subjection to the Deity and in a predetermined aim toward which nations are led, modern history should study not the manifestations of power but the causes that produce it. But modern history has not done this. Having in theory rejected the view held by the ancients, it still follows them in practice.\n\nInstead of men endowed with divine authority and directly guided by the will of God, modern history has given us either heroes endowed with extraordinary, superhuman capacities, or simply men of very various kinds, from monarchs to journalists, who lead the masses. Instead of the former divinely appointed aims of the Jewish, Greek, or Roman nations, which ancient historians regarded as representing the progress of humanity, modern history has postulated its own aims\u2014the welfare of the French, German, or English people, or, in its highest abstraction, the welfare and civilization of humanity in general, by which is usually meant that of the peoples occupying a small northwesterly portion of a large continent.\n\nModern history has rejected the beliefs of the ancients without replacing them by a new conception, and the logic of the situation has obliged the historians, after they had apparently rejected the divine authority of the kings and the \u201cfate\u201d of the ancients, to reach the same conclusion by another road, that is, to recognize (1) nations guided by individual men, and (2) the existence of a known aim to which these nations and humanity at large are tending.\n\nAt the basis of the works of all the modern historians from Gibbon to Buckle, despite their seeming disagreements and the apparent novelty of their outlooks, lie those two old, unavoidable assumptions.\n\nIn the first place the historian describes the activity of individuals who in his opinion have directed humanity (one historian considers only monarchs, generals, and ministers as being such men, while another includes also orators, learned men, reformers, philosophers, and poets). Secondly, it is assumed that the goal toward which humanity is being led is known to the historians: to one of them this goal is the greatness of the Roman, Spanish, or French realm; to another it is liberty, equality, and a certain kind of civilization of a small corner of the world called Europe.\n\nIn 1789 a ferment arises in Paris; it grows, spreads, and is expressed by a movement of peoples from west to east. Several times it moves eastward and collides with a countermovement from the east westward. In 1812 it reaches its extreme limit, Moscow, and then, with remarkable symmetry, a countermovement occurs from east to west, attracting to it, as the first movement had done, the nations of middle Europe. The counter movement reaches the starting point of the first movement in the west\u2014Paris\u2014and subsides.\n\nDuring that twenty-year period an immense number of fields were left untilled, houses were burned, trade changed its direction, millions of men migrated, were impoverished, or were enriched, and millions of Christian men professing the law of love of their fellows slew one another.\n\nWhat does all this mean? Why did it happen? What made those people burn houses and slay their fellow men? What were the causes of these events? What force made men act so? These are the instinctive, plain, and most legitimate questions humanity asks itself when it encounters the monuments and tradition of that period.\n\nFor a reply to these questions the common sense of mankind turns to the science of history, whose aim is to enable nations and humanity to know themselves.\n\nIf history had retained the conception of the ancients it would have said that God, to reward or punish his people, gave Napoleon power and directed his will to the fulfillment of the divine ends, and that reply would have been clear and complete. One might believe or disbelieve in the divine significance of Napoleon, but for anyone believing in it there would have been nothing unintelligible in the history of that period, nor would there have been any contradictions.\n\nBut modern history cannot give that reply. Science does not admit the conception of the ancients as to the direct participation of the Deity in human affairs, and therefore history ought to give other answers.\n\nModern history replying to these questions says: you want to know what this movement means, what caused it, and what force produced these events? Then listen:\n\n\u201cLouis XIV was a very proud and self-confident man; he had such and such mistresses and such and such ministers and he ruled France badly. His descendants were weak men and they too ruled France badly. And they had such and such favorites and such and such mistresses. Moreover, certain men wrote some books at that time. At the end of the eighteenth century there were a couple of dozen men in Paris who began to talk about all men being free and equal. This caused people all over France to begin to slash at and drown one another. They killed the king and many other people. At that time there was in France a man of genius\u2014Napoleon. He conquered everybody everywhere\u2014that is, he killed many people because he was a great genius. And for some reason he went to kill Africans, and killed them so well and was so cunning and wise that when he returned to France he ordered everybody to obey him, and they all obeyed him. Having become an Emperor he again went out to kill people in Italy, Austria, and Prussia. And there too he killed a great many. In Russia there was an Emperor, Alexander, who decided to restore order in Europe and therefore fought against Napoleon. In 1807 he suddenly made friends with him, but in 1811 they again quarreled and again began killing many people. Napoleon led six hundred thousand men into Russia and captured Moscow; then he suddenly ran away from Moscow, and the Emperor Alexander, helped by the advice of Stein and others, united Europe to arm against the disturber of its peace. All Napoleon\u2019s allies suddenly became his enemies and their forces advanced against the fresh forces he raised. The Allies defeated Napoleon, entered Paris, forced Napoleon to abdicate, and sent him to the island of Elba, not depriving him of the title of Emperor and showing him every respect, though five years before and one year later they all regarded him as an outlaw and a brigand. Then Louis XVIII, who till then had been the laughingstock both of the French and the Allies, began to reign. And Napoleon, shedding tears before his Old Guards, renounced the throne and went into exile. Then the skillful statesmen and diplomatists (especially Talleyrand, who managed to sit down in a particular chair before anyone else and thereby extended the frontiers of France) talked in Vienna and by these conversations made the nations happy or unhappy. Suddenly the diplomatists and monarchs nearly quarreled and were on the point of again ordering their armies to kill one another, but just then Napoleon arrived in France with a battalion, and the French, who had been hating him, immediately all submitted to him. But the Allied monarchs were angry at this and went to fight the French once more. And they defeated the genius Napoleon and, suddenly recognizing him as a brigand, sent him to the island of St. Helena. And the exile, separated from the beloved France so dear to his heart, died a lingering death on that rock and bequeathed his great deeds to posterity. But in Europe a reaction occurred and the sovereigns once again all began to oppress their subjects.\u201d\n\nIt would be a mistake to think that this is ironic\u2014a caricature of the historical accounts. On the contrary it is a very mild expression of the contradictory replies, not meeting the questions, which all the historians give, from the compilers of memoirs and the histories of separate states to the writers of general histories and the new histories of the culture of that period.\n\nThe strangeness and absurdity of these replies arise from the fact that modern history, like a deaf man, answers questions no one has asked.\n\nIf the purpose of history be to give a description of the movement of humanity and of the peoples, the first question\u2014in the absence of a reply to which all the rest will be incomprehensible\u2014is: what is the power that moves peoples? To this, modern history laboriously replies either that Napoleon was a great genius, or that Louis XIV was very proud, or that certain writers wrote certain books.\n\nAll that may be so and mankind is ready to agree with it, but it is not what was ask", "sequence": 30}, {"offset": 3100000, "text": "ed. All that would be interesting if we recognized a divine power based on itself and always consistently directing its nations through Napoleons, Louis-es, and writers; but we do not acknowledge such a power, and therefore before speaking about Napoleons, Louis-es, and authors, we ought to be shown the connection existing between these men and the movement of the nations.\n\nIf instead of a divine power some other force has appeared, it should be explained in what this new force consists, for the whole interest of history lies precisely in that force.\n\nHistory seems to assume that this force is self-evident and known to everyone. But in spite of every desire to regard it as known, anyone reading many historical works cannot help doubting whether this new force, so variously understood by the historians themselves, is really quite well known to everybody.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nWhat force moves the nations?\n\nBiographical historians and historians of separate nations understand this force as a power inherent in heroes and rulers. In their narration events occur solely by the will of a Napoleon, and Alexander, or in general of the persons they describe. The answers given by this kind of historian to the question of what force causes events to happen are satisfactory only as long as there is but one historian to each event. As soon as historians of different nationalities and tendencies begin to describe the same event, the replies they give immediately lose all meaning, for this force is understood by them all not only differently but often in quite contradictory ways. One historian says that an event was produced by Napoleon\u2019s power, another that it was produced by Alexander\u2019s, a third that it was due to the power of some other person. Besides this, historians of that kind contradict each other even in their statement as to the force on which the authority of some particular person was based. Thiers, a Bonapartist, says that Napoleon\u2019s power was based on his virtue and genius. Lanfrey, a Republican, says it was based on his trickery and deception of the people. So the historians of this class, by mutually destroying one another\u2019s positions, destroy the understanding of the force which produces events, and furnish no reply to history\u2019s essential question.\n\nWriters of universal history who deal with all the nations seem to recognize how erroneous is the specialist historians\u2019 view of the force which produces events. They do not recognize it as a power inherent in heroes and rulers, but as the resultant of a multiplicity of variously directed forces. In describing a war or the subjugation of a people, a general historian looks for the cause of the event not in the power of one man, but in the interaction of many persons connected with the event.\n\nAccording to this view the power of historical personages, represented as the product of many forces, can no longer, it would seem, be regarded as a force that itself produces events. Yet in most cases universal historians still employ the conception of power as a force that itself produces events, and treat it as their cause. In their exposition, an historic character is first the product of his time, and his power only the resultant of various forces, and then his power is itself a force producing events. Gervinus, Schlosser, and others, for instance, at one time prove Napoleon to be a product of the Revolution, of the ideas of 1789 and so forth, and at another plainly say that the campaign of 1812 and other things they do not like were simply the product of Napoleon\u2019s misdirected will, and that the very ideas of 1789 were arrested in their development by Napoleon\u2019s caprice. The ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age produced Napoleon\u2019s power. But Napoleon\u2019s power suppressed the ideas of the Revolution and the general temper of the age.\n\nThis curious contradiction is not accidental. Not only does it occur at every step, but the universal historians\u2019 accounts are all made up of a chain of such contradictions. This contradiction occurs because after entering the field of analysis the universal historians stop halfway.\n\nTo find component forces equal to the composite or resultant force, the sum of the components must equal the resultant. This condition is never observed by the universal historians, and so to explain the resultant forces they are obliged to admit, in addition to the insufficient components, another unexplained force affecting the resultant action.\n\nSpecialist historians describing the campaign of 1813 or the restoration of the Bourbons plainly assert that these events were produced by the will of Alexander. But the universal historian Gervinus, refuting this opinion of the specialist historian, tries to prove that the campaign of 1813 and the restoration of the Bourbons were due to other things beside Alexander\u2019s will\u2014such as the activity of Stein, Metternich, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, Talleyrand, Fichte, Chateaubriand, and others. The historian evidently decomposes Alexander\u2019s power into the components: Talleyrand, Chateaubriand, and the rest\u2014but the sum of the components, that is, the interactions of Chateaubriand, Talleyrand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and the others, evidently does not equal the resultant, namely the phenomenon of millions of Frenchmen submitting to the Bourbons. That Chateaubriand, Madame de Sta\u00ebl, and others spoke certain words to one another only affected their mutual relations but does not account for the submission of millions. And therefore to explain how from these relations of theirs the submission of millions of people resulted\u2014that is, how component forces equal to one A gave a resultant equal to a thousand times A\u2014the historian is again obliged to fall back on power\u2014the force he had denied\u2014and to recognize it as the resultant of the forces, that is, he has to admit an unexplained force acting on the resultant. And that is just what the universal historians do, and consequently they not only contradict the specialist historians but contradict themselves.\n\nPeasants having no clear idea of the cause of rain, say, according to whether they want rain or fine weather: \u201cThe wind has blown the clouds away,\u201d or, \u201cThe wind has brought up the clouds.\u201d And in the same way the universal historians sometimes, when it pleases them and fits in with their theory, say that power is the result of events, and sometimes, when they want to prove something else, say that power produces events.\n\nA third class of historians\u2014the so-called historians of culture\u2014following the path laid down by the universal historians who sometimes accept writers and ladies as forces producing events\u2014again take that force to be something quite different. They see it in what is called culture\u2014in mental activity.\n\nThe historians of culture are quite consistent in regard to their progenitors, the writers of universal histories, for if historical events may be explained by the fact that certain persons treated one another in such and such ways, why not explain them by the fact that such and such people wrote such and such books? Of the immense number of indications accompanying every vital phenomenon, these historians select the indication of intellectual activity and say that this indication is the cause. But despite their endeavors to prove that the cause of events lies in intellectual activity, only by a great stretch can one admit that there is any connection between intellectual activity and the movement of peoples, and in no case can one admit that intellectual activity controls people\u2019s actions, for that view is not confirmed by such facts as the very cruel murders of the French Revolution resulting from the doctrine of the equality of man, or the very cruel wars and executions resulting from the preaching of love.\n\nBut even admitting as correct all the cunningly devised arguments with which these histories are filled\u2014admitting that nations are governed by some undefined force called an idea\u2014history\u2019s essential question still remains unanswered, and to the former power of monarchs and to the influence of advisers and other people introduced by the universal historians, another, newer force\u2014the idea\u2014is added, the connection of which with the masses needs explanation. It is possible to understand that Napoleon had power and so events occurred; with some effort one may even conceive that Napoleon together with other influences was the cause of an event; but how a book, Le Contrat Social, had the effect of making Frenchmen begin to drown one another cannot be understood without an explanation of the causal nexus of this new force with the event.\n\nUndoubtedly some relation exists between all who live contemporaneously, and so it is possible to find some connection between the intellectual activity of men and their historical movements, just as such a connection may be found between the movements of humanity and commerce, handicraft, gardening, or anything else you please. But why intellectual activity is considered by the historians of culture to be the cause or expression of the whole historical movement is hard to understand. Only the following considerations can have led the historians to such a conclusion: (1) that history is written by learned men, and so it is natural and agreeable for them to think that the activity of their class supplies the basis of the movement of all humanity, just as a similar belief is natural and agreeable to traders, agriculturists, and soldiers (if they do not express it, that is merely because traders and soldiers do not write history), and (2) that spiritual activity, enlightenment, civilization, culture, ideas, are all indistinct, indefinite conceptions under whose banner it is very easy to use words having a still less definite meaning, and which can therefore be readily introduced into any theory.\n\nBut not to speak of the intrinsic quality of histories of this kind (which may possibly even be of use to someone for something) the histories of culture, to which all general histories tend more and more to approximate, are significant from the fact that after seriously and minutely examining various religious, philosophic, and political doctrines as causes of events, as soon as they have to describe an actual historic event such as the campaign of 1812 for instance, they involuntarily describe it as resulting from an exercise of power\u2014and say plainly that that was the result of Napoleon\u2019s will. Speaking so, the historians of culture involuntarily contradict themselves, and show that the new force they have devised does not account for what happens in history, and that history can only be explained by introducing a power which they apparently do not recognize.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER III\n\nA locomotive is moving. Someone asks: \u201cWhat moves it?\u201d A peasant says the devil moves it. Another man says the locomotive moves because its wheels go round. A third asserts that the cause of its movement lies in the smoke which the wind carries away.\n\nThe peasant is irrefutable. He has devised a complete explanation. To refute him someone would have to prove to him that there is no devil, or another peasant would have to explain to him that it is not the devil but a German, who moves the locomotive. Only then, as a result of the contradiction, will they see that they are both wrong. But the man who says that the movement of the wheels is the cause refutes himself, for having once begun to analyze he ought to go on and explain further why the wheels go round; and till he has reached the ultimate cause of the movement of the locomotive in the pressure of steam in the boiler, he has no right to stop in his search for the cause. The man who explains the movement of the locomotive by the smoke that is carried back has noticed that the wheels do not supply an explanation and has taken the first sign that occurs to him and in his turn has offered that as an explanation.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the locomotive is that of a force commensurate with the movement observed.\n\nThe only conception that can explain the movement of the peoples is that of some force commensurate with the whole movement of the peoples.\n\nYet to supply this conception various historians take forces of different kinds, all of which are incommensurate with the movement observed. Some see it as a force directly inherent in heroes, as the peasant sees the devil in the locomotive; others as a force resulting from several other forces, like the movement of the wheels; others again as an intellectual influence, like the smoke that is blown away.\n\nSo long as histories are written of separate individuals, whether Caesars, Alexanders, Luthers, or Voltaires, and not the histories of all, absolutely all those who take part in an event, it is quite impossible to describe the movement of humanity without the conception of a force compelling men to direct their activity toward a certain end. And the only such conception known to historians is that of power.\n\nThis conception is the one handle by means of which the material of history, as at present expounded, can be dealt with, and anyone who breaks that handle off, as Buckle did, without finding some other method of treating historical material, merely deprives himself of the one possible way of dealing with it. The necessity of the conception of power as an explanation of historical events is best demonstrated by the universal historians and historians of culture themselves, for they professedly reject that conception but inevitably have recourse to it at every step.\n\nIn dealing with humanity\u2019s inquiry, the science of history up to now is like money in circulation\u2014paper money and coin. The biographies and special national histories are like paper money. They can be used and can circulate and fulfill their purpose without harm to anyone and even advantageously, as long as no one asks what is the security behind them. You need only forget to ask how the will of heroes produces events, and such histories as Thiers\u2019 will be interesting and instructive and may perhaps even possess a tinge of poetry. But just as doubts of the real value of paper money arise either because, being easy to make, too much of it gets made or because people try to exchange it for gold, so also doubts concerning the real value of such histories arise either because too many of them are written or because in his simplicity of heart someone inquires: by what force did Napoleon do this?\u2014that is, wants to exchange the current paper money for the real gold of actual comprehension.\n\nThe writers of universal histories and of the history of culture are like people who, recognizing the defects of paper money, decide to substitute for it money made of metal that has not the specific gravity of gold. It may indeed make jingling coin, but will do no more than that. Paper money may deceive the ignorant, but nobody is deceived by tokens of base metal that have no value but merely jingle. As gold is gold only if it is serviceable not merely for exchange but also for use, so universal historians will be valuable only when they can reply to history\u2019s essential question: what is power? The universal historians give contradictory replies to that question, while the historians of culture evade it and answer something quite different. And as counters of imitation gold can be used only among a group of people who agree to accept them as gold, or among those who do not know the nature of gold, so universal historians and historians of culture, not answering humanity\u2019s essential question, serve as currency for some purposes of their own, only in universities and among the mass of readers who have a taste for what they call \u201cserious reading.\u201d\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IV\n\nHaving abandoned the conception of the ancients as to the divine subjection of the will of a nation to some chosen man and the subjection of that man\u2019s will to the Deity, history cannot without contradictions take a single step till it has chosen one of two things: either a return to the former belief in the direct intervention of the Deity in human affairs or a definite explanation of the meaning of the force producing historical events and termed \u201cpower.\u201d\n\nA return to the first is impossible, the belief has been destroyed; and so it is essential to explain what is meant by power.\n\nNapoleon ordered an army to be raised and go to war. We are so accustomed to that idea and have become so used to it that the question: why did six hundred thousand men go to fight when Napoleon uttered certain words, seems to us senseless. He had the power and so what he ordered was done.\n\nThis reply is quite satisfactory if we believe that the power was given him by God. But as soon as we do not admit that, it becomes essential to determine what is this power of one man over others.\n\nIt cannot be the direct physical power of a strong man over a weak one\u2014a domination based on the application or threat of physical force, like the power of Hercules; nor can it be based on the effect of moral force, as in their simplicity some historians think who say that the leading figures in history are heroes, that is, men gifted with a special strength of soul and mind called genius. This power cannot be based on the predominance of moral strength, for, not to mention heroes such as Napoleon about whose moral qualities opinions differ widely, history shows us that neither a Louis XI nor a Metternich, who ruled over millions of people, had any particular moral qualities, but on the contrary were generally morally weaker than any of the millions they ruled over.\n\nIf the source of power lies neither in the physical nor in the moral qualities of him who possesses it, it must evidently be looked for elsewhere\u2014in the relation to the people of the man who wields the power.\n\nAnd that is how power is understood by the science of jurisprudence, that exchange bank of history which offers to exchange history\u2019s understanding of power for true gold.\n\nPower is the collective will of the people transferred, by expressed or tacit consent, to their chosen rulers.\n\nIn the domain of jurisprudence, which consists of discussions of how a state and power might be arranged were it possible for all that to be arranged, it is all very clear; but when applied to history that definition of power needs explanation.\n\nThe science of jurisprudence regards the state and power as the ancients regarded fire\u2014namely, as something existing absolutely. But for history, the state and power are merely phenomena, just as for modern physics fire is not an element but a phenomenon.\n\nFrom this fundamental difference between the view held by history and that held by jurisprudence, it follows that jurisprudence can tell minutely how in its opinion power should be constituted and what power\u2014existing immutably outside time\u2014is, but to history\u2019s questions about the meaning of the mutations of power in time it can answer nothing.\n\nIf power be the collective will of the people transferred to their ruler, was Pugach\u00ebv a representative of the will of the people? If not, then why was Napoleon I? Why was Napoleon III a criminal when he was taken prisoner at Boulogne, and why, later on, were those criminals whom he arrested?\n\nDo palace revolutions\u2014in which sometimes only two or three people take part\u2014transfer the will of the people to a new ruler? In international relations, is the will of the people also transferred to their conqueror? Was the will of the Confederation of the Rhine transferred to Napoleon in 1806? Was the will of the Russian people transferred to Napoleon in 1809, when our army in alliance with the French went to fight the Austrians?\n\nTo these questions three answers are possible:\n\nEither to assume (1) that the will of the people is always unconditionally transferred to the ruler or rulers they have chosen, and that therefore every emergence of a new power, every struggle against the power once appointed, should be absolutely regarded as an infringement of the real power; or (2) that the will of the people is transferred to the rulers conditionally, under definite and known conditions, and to show that all limitations, conflicts, and even destructions of power result from a nonobservance by the rulers of the conditions under which their power was entrusted to them; or (3) that the will of the people is delegated to the rulers conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown and indefinite, and that the appearance of several authorities, their struggles and their falls, result solely from the greater or lesser fulfillment by the rulers of these unknown conditions on which the will of the people is transferred from some people to others.\n\nAnd these are the three ways in which the historians do explain the relation of the people to their rulers.\n\nSome historians\u2014those biographical and specialist historians already referred to\u2014in their simplicity failing to understand the question of the meaning of power, seem to consider that the collective will of the people is unconditionally transferred to historical persons, and therefore when describing some single state they assume that particular power to be the one absolute and real power, and that any other force opposing this is not a power but a violation of power\u2014mere violence.\n\nTheir theory, suitable for primitive and peaceful periods of history, has the inconvenience\u2014in application to complex and stormy periods in the life of nations during which various powers arise simultaneously and struggle with one another\u2014that a Legitimist historian will prove that the National Convention, the Directory, and Bonaparte were mere infringers of the true power, while a Republican and a Bonapartist will prove: the one that the Convention and the other that the Empire was the real power, and that all the others were violations of power. Evidently the explanations furnished by these historians being mutually contradictory can only satisfy young children.\n\nRecognizing the falsity of this view of history, another set of historians say that power rests on a conditional delegation of the will of the people to their rulers, and that historical leaders have power only conditionally on carrying out the program that the will of the people has by tacit agreement prescribed to them. But what this program consists in these historians do not say, or if they do they continually contradict one another.\n\nEach historian, according to his view of what constitutes a nation\u2019s progress, looks for these conditions in the greatness, wealth, freedom, or enlightenment of citizens of France or some other country. But not to mention the historians\u2019 contradictions as to the nature of this program\u2014or even admitting that some one general program of these conditions exists\u2014the facts of history almost always contradict that theory. If the conditions under which power is entrusted consist in the wealth, freedom, and enlightenment of the people, how is it that Louis XIV and Iv\u00e1n the Terrible end their reigns tranquilly, while Louis XVI and Charles I are executed by their people? To this question historians reply that Louis XIV\u2019s activity, contrary to the program, reacted on Louis XVI. But why did it not react on Louis XIV or on Louis XV\u2014why should it react just on Louis XVI? And what is the time limit for such reactions? To these questions there are and can be no answers. Equally little does this view explain why for several centuries the collective will is not withdrawn from certain rulers and their heirs, and then suddenly during a period of fifty years is transferred to the Convention, to the Directory, to Napoleon, to Alexander, to Louis XVIII, to Napoleon again, to Charles X, to Louis Philippe, to a Republican government, and to Napoleon III. When explaining these rapid transfers of the people\u2019s will from one individual to another, especially in view of international relations, conquests, and alliances, the historians are obliged to admit that some of these transfers are not normal delegations of the people\u2019s will but are accidents dependent on cunning, on mistakes, on craft, or on the weakness of a diplomatist, a ruler, or a party leader. So that the greater part of the events of history\u2014civil wars, revolutions, and conquests\u2014are presented by these historians not as the results of free transferences of the people\u2019s will, but as results of the ill-directed will of one or more individuals, that is, once again, as usurpations of power. And so these historians also see and admit historical events which are exceptions to the theory.\n\nThese historians resemble a botanist who, having noticed that some plants grow from seeds producing two cotyledons, should insist that all that grows does so by sprouting into two leaves, and that the palm, the mushroom, and even the oak, which blossom into full growth and no longer resemble two leaves, are deviations from the theory.\n\nHistorians of the third class assume that the will of the people is transferred to historic personages conditionally, but that the conditions are unknown to us. They say that historical personages have power only because they fulfill the will of the people which has been delegated to them.\n\nBut in that case, if the force that moves nations lies not in the historic leaders but in the nations themselves, what significance have those leaders?\n\nThe leaders, these historians tell us, express the will of the people: the activity of the leaders represents the activity of the people.\n\nBut in that case the question arises whether all the activity of the leaders serves as an expression of the people\u2019s will or only some part of it. If the whole activity of the leaders serves as the expression of the people\u2019s will, as some historians suppose, then all the details of the court scandals contained in the biographies of a Napoleon or a Catherine serve to express the life of the nation, which is evident nonsense; but if it is only some particular side of the activity of an historical leader which serves to express the people\u2019s life, as other so-called \u201cphilosophical\u201d historians believe, then to determine which side of the activity of a leader expresses the nation\u2019s life, we have first of all to know in what the nation\u2019s life consists.\n\nMet by this difficulty historians of that class devise some most obscure, impalpable, and general abstraction which can cover all conceivable occurrences, and declare this abstraction to be the aim of humanity\u2019s movement. The most usual generalizations adopted by almost all the historians are: freedom, equality, enlightenment, progress, civilization, and culture. Postulating some generalization as the goal of the movement of humanity, the historians study the men of whom the greatest number of monuments have remained: kings, ministers, generals, authors, reformers, popes, and journalists, to the extent to which in their opinion these persons have promoted or hindered that abstraction. But as it is in no way proved that the aim of humanity does consist in freedom, equality, enlightenment, or civilization, and as the connection of the people with the rulers and enlighteners of humanity is only based on the arbitrary assumption that the collective will of the people is always transferred to the men whom we have noticed, it happens that the activity of the millions who migrate, burn houses, abandon agriculture, and destroy one another never is expressed in the account of the activity of some dozen people who did not burn houses, practice agriculture, or slay their fellow creatures.\n\nHistory proves this at every turn. Is the ferment of the peoples of the west at the end of the eighteenth century and their drive eastward explained by the activity of Louis XIV, XV, and XVI, their mistresses and ministers, and by the lives of Napoleon, Rousseau, Diderot, Beaumarchais, and others?\n\nIs the movement of the Russian people eastward to Kaz\u00e1n and Siberia expressed by details of the morbid character of Iv\u00e1n the Terrible and by his correspondence with K\u00farbski?\n\nIs the movement of the peoples at the time of the Crusades explained by the life and activity of the Godfreys and the Louis-es and their ladies? For us that movement of the peoples from west to east, without leaders, with a crowd of vagrants, and with Peter the Hermit, remains incomprehensible. And yet more incomprehensible is the cessation of that movement when a rational and sacred aim for the Crusade\u2014the deliverance of Jerusalem\u2014had been clearly defined by historic leaders. Popes, kings, and knights incited the peoples to free the Holy Land; but the people did not go, for the unknown cause which had previously impelled them to go no longer existed. The history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers can evidently not cover the life of the peoples. And the history of the Godfreys and the Minnesingers has remained the history of Godfreys and Minnesingers, but the history of the life of the peoples and their impulses has remained unknown.\n\nStill less does the history of authors and reformers explain to us the life of the peoples.\n\nThe history of culture explains to us the impulses and conditions of life and thought of a writer or a reformer. We learn that Luther had a hot temper and said such and such things; we learn that Rousseau was suspicious and wrote such and such books; but we do not learn why after the Reformation the peoples massacred one another, nor why during the French Revolution they guillotined one another.\n\nIf we unite both these kinds of history, as is done by the newest historians, we shall have the history of monarchs and writers, but not the history of the life of the peoples.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER V\n\nThe life of the nations is not contained in the lives of a few men, for the connection between those men and the nations has not been found. The theory that this connection is based on the transference of the collective will of a people to certain historical personages is an hypothesis unconfirmed by the experience of history.\n\nThe theory of the transference of the collective will of the people to historic persons may perhaps explain much in the domain of jurisprudence and be essential for its purposes, but in its application to history, as soon as revolutions, conquests, or civil wars occur\u2014that is, as soon as history begins\u2014that theory explains nothing.\n\nThe theory seems irrefutable just because the act of transference of the people\u2019s will cannot be verified, for it never occurred.\n\nWhatever happens and whoever may stand at the head of affairs, the theory can always say that such and such a person took the lead because the collective will was transferred to him.\n\nThe replies this theory gives to historical questions are like the replies of a man who, watching the movements of a herd of cattle and paying no attention to the varying quality of the pasturage in different parts of the field, or to the driving of the herdsman, should attribute the direction the herd takes to what animal happens to be at its head.\n\n\u201cThe herd goes in that direction because the animal in front leads it and the collective will of all the other animals is vested in that leader.\u201d This is what historians of the first class say\u2014those who assume the unconditional transference of the people\u2019s will.\n\n\u201cIf the animals leading the herd change, this happens because the collective will of all the animals is transferred from one leader to another, according to whether the animal is or is not leading them in the direction selected by the whole herd.\u201d Such is the reply historians who assume that the collective will of the people is delegated to rulers under conditions which they regard as known. (With this method of observation it often happens that the observer, influenced by the direction he himself prefers, regards those as leaders who, owing to the people\u2019s change of direction, are no longer in front, but on one side, or even in the rear.)\n\n\u201cIf the animals in front are continually changing and the direction of the whole herd is constantly altered, this is because in order to follow a given direction the animals transfer their will to the animals that have attracted our attention, and to study the movements of the herd we must watch the movements of all the prominent animals moving on all sides of the herd.\u201d So say the third class of historians who regard all historical persons, from monarchs to journalists, as the expression of their age.\n\nThe theory of the transference of the will of the people to historic persons is merely a paraphrase\u2014a restatement of the question in other words.\n\nWhat causes historical events? Power. What is power? Power is the collective will of the people transferred to one person. Under what condition is the will of the people delegated to one person? On condition that that person expresses the will of the whole people. That is, power is power: in other words, power is a word the meaning of which we do not understand.\n\nIf the realm of human knowledge were confined to abstract reasoning, then having subjected to criticism the explanation of \u201cpower\u201d that juridical science gives us, humanity would conclude that power is merely a word and has no real existence. But to understand phenomena man has, besides abstract reasoning, experience by which he verifies his reflections. And experience tells us that power is not merely a word but an actually existing phenomenon.\n\nNot to speak of the fact that no description of the collective activity of men can do without the conception of power, the existence of power is proved both by history and by observing contemporary events.\n\nWhenever an event occurs a man appears or men appear, by whose will the event seems to have taken place. Napoleon III issues a decree and the French go to Mexico. The King of Prussia and Bismarck issue decrees and an army enters Bohemia. Napoleon I issues a decree and an army enters Russia. Alexander I gives a command and the French submit to the Bourbons. Experience shows us that whatever event occurs it is always related to the will of one or of several men who have decreed it.\n\nThe historians, in accord with the old habit of acknowledging divine intervention in human affairs, want to see the cause of events in the expression of the will of someone endowed with power, but that supposition is not confirmed either by reason or by experience.\n\nOn the one side reflection shows that the expression of a man\u2019s will\u2014his words\u2014are only part of the general activity expressed in an event, as for instance in a war or a revolution, and so without assuming an incomprehensible, supernatural force\u2014a miracle\u2014one cannot admit that words can be the immediate cause of the movements of millions of men. On the other hand, even if we admitted that words could be the cause of events, history shows that the expression of the will of historical personages does not in most cases produce any effect, that is to say, their commands are often not executed, and sometimes the very opposite of what they order occurs.\n\nWithout admitting divine intervention in the affairs of humanity we cannot regard \u201cpower\u201d as the cause of events.\n\nPower, from the standpoint of experience, is merely the relation that exists between the expression of someone\u2019s will and the execution of that will by others.\n\nTo explain the conditions of that relationship we must first establish a conception of the expression of will, referring it to man and not to the Deity.\n\nIf the Deity issues a command, expresses His will, as ancient history tells us, the expression of that will is independent of time and is not caused by anything, for the Divinity is not controlled by an event. But speaking of commands that are the expression of the will of men acting in time and in relation to one another, to explain the connection of commands with events we must restore: (1) the condition of all that takes place: the continuity of movement in time both of the events and of the person who commands, and (2) the inevitability of the connection between the person commanding and those who execute his command.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VI\n\nOnly the expression of the will of the Deity, not dependent on time, can relate to a whole series of events occurring over a period of years or centuries, and only the Deity, independent of everything, can by His sole will determine the direction of humanity\u2019s movement; but man acts in time and himself takes part in what occurs.\n\nReinstating the first condition omitted, that of time, we see that no command can be executed without some preceding order having been given rendering the execution of the last command possible.\n\nNo command ever appears spontaneously, or itself covers a whole series of occurrences; but each command follows from another, and never refers to a whole series of events but always to one moment only of an event.\n\nWhen, for instance, we say that Napoleon ordered armies to go to war, we combine in one simultaneous expression a whole series of consecutive commands dependent one on another. Napoleon could not have commanded an invasion of Russia and never did so. Today he ordered such and such papers to be written to Vienna, to Berlin, and to Petersburg; tomorrow such and such decrees and orders to the army, the fleet, the commissariat, and so on and so on\u2014millions of commands, which formed a whole series corresponding to a series of events which brought the French armies into Russia.\n\nIf throughout his reign Napoleon gave commands concerning an invasion of England and expended on no other undertaking so much time and effort, and yet during his whole reign never once attempted to execute that design but undertook an expedition into Russia, with which country he considered it desirable to be in alliance (a conviction he repeatedly expressed)\u2014this came about because his commands did not correspond to the course of events in the first case, but did so correspond in the latter.\n\nFor an order to be certainly executed, it is necessary that a man should order what can be executed. But to know what can and what cannot be executed is impossible, not only in the case of Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia in which millions participated, but even in the simplest event, for in either case millions of obstacles may arise to prevent its execution. Every order executed is always one of an immense number unexecuted. All the impossible orders inconsistent with the course of events remain unexecuted. Only the possible ones get linked up with a consecutive series of commands corresponding to a series of events, and are executed.\n\nOur false conception that an event is caused by a command which precedes it is due to the fact that when the event has taken place and out of thousands of others those few commands which were consistent with that event have been executed, we forget about the others that were not executed because they could not be. Apart from that, the chief source of our error in this matter is due to the fact that in the historical accounts a whole series of innumerable, diverse, and petty events, such for instance as all those which led the French armies to Russia, is generalized into one event in accord with the result produced by that series of events, and corresponding with this generalization the whole series of commands is also generalized into a single expression of will.\n\nWe say that Napoleon wished to invade Russia and invaded it. In reality in all Napoleon\u2019s activity we never find anything resembling an expression of that wish, but find a series of orders, or expressions of his will, very variously and indefinitely directed. Amid a long series of unexecuted orders of Napoleon\u2019s one series, for the campaign of 1812, was carried out\u2014not because those orders differed in any way from the other, unexecuted orders but because they coincided with the course of events that led the French army into Russia; just as in stencil work this or that figure comes out not because the color was laid on from this side or in that way, but because it was laid on from all sides over the figure cut in the stencil.\n\nSo that examining the relation in time of the commands to the events, we find that a command can never be the cause of the event, but that a certain definite dependence exists between the two.\n\nTo understand in what this dependence consists it is necessary to reinstate another omitted condition of every command proceeding not from the Deity but from a man, which is, that the man who gives the command himself takes part in the event.\n\nThis relation of the commander to those he commands is just what is called power. This relation consists in the following:\n\nFor common action people always unite in certain combinations, in which regardless of the difference of the aims set for the common action, the relation between those taking part in it is always the same.\n\nMen uniting in these combinations always assume such relations toward one another that the larger number take a more direct share, and the smaller number a less direct share, in the collective action for which they have combined.\n\nOf all the combinations in which men unite for collective action one of the most striking and definite examples is an army.\n\nEvery army is composed of lower grades of the service\u2014the rank and file\u2014of whom there are always the greatest number; of the next higher military rank\u2014corporals and noncommissioned officers of whom there are fewer, and of still-higher officers of whom there are still fewer, and so on to the highest military command which is concentrated in one person.\n\nA military organization may be quite correctly compared to a cone, of which the base with the largest diameter consists of the rank and file; the next higher and smaller section of the cone consists of the next higher grades of the army, and so on to the apex, the point of which will represent the commander in chief.\n\nThe soldiers, of whom there are the most, form the lower section of the cone and its base. The soldier himself does the stabbing, hacking, burning, and pillaging, and always receives orders for these actions from men above him; he himself never gives an order. The noncommissioned officers (of whom there are fewer) perform the action itself less frequently than the soldiers, but they already give commands. An officer still less often acts directly himself, but commands still more frequently. A general does nothing but command the troops, indicates the objective, and hardly ever uses a weapon himself. The commander in chief never takes direct part in the action itself, but only gives general orders concerning the movement of the mass of the troops. A similar relation of people to one another is seen in every combination of men for common activity\u2014in agriculture, trade, and every administration.\n\nAnd so without particularly analyzing all the contiguous sections of a cone and of the ranks of an army, or the ranks and positions in any administrative or public business whatever from the lowest to the highest, we see a law by which men, to take associated action, combine in such relations that the more directly they participate in performing the action the less they can command and the more numerous they are, while the less their direct participation in the action itself, the more they command and the fewer of them there are; rising in this way from the lowest ranks to the man at the top, who takes the least direct share in the action and directs his activity chiefly to commanding.\n\nThis relation of the men who command to those they command is what constitutes the essence of the conception called power.\n\nHaving restored the condition of time under which all events occur, we find that a command is executed only when it is related to a corresponding series of events. Restoring the essential condition of relation between those who command and those who execute, we find that by the very nature of the case those who command take the smallest part in the action itself and that their activity is exclusively directed to commanding.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VII\n\nWhen an event is taking place people express their opinions and wishes about it, and as the event results from the collective activity of many people, some one of the opinions or wishes expressed is sure to be fulfilled if but approximately. When one of the opinions expressed is fulfilled, that opinion gets connected with the event as a command preceding it.\n\nMen are hauling a log. Each of them expresses his opinion as to how and where to haul it. They haul the log away, and it happens that this is done as one of them said. He ordered it. There we have command and power in their primary form. The man who worked most with his hands could not think so much about what he was doing, or reflect on or command what would result from the common activity; while the man who commanded more would evidently work less with his hands on account of his greater verbal activity.\n\nWhen some larger concourse of men direct their activity to a common aim there is a yet sharper division of those who, because their activity is given to directing and commanding, take less part in the direct work.\n\nWhen a man works alone he always has a certain set of reflections which as it seems to him directed his past activity, justify his present activity, and guide him in planning his future actions. Just the same is done by a concourse of people, allowing those who do not take a direct part in the activity to devise considerations, justifications, and surmises concerning their collective activity.\n\nFor reasons known or unknown to us the French began to drown and kill one another. And corresponding to the event its justification appears in people\u2019s belief that this was necessary for the welfare of France, for liberty, and for equality. People ceased to kill one another, and this event was accompanied by its justification in the necessity for a centralization of power, resistance to Europe, and so on. Men went from the west to the east killing their fellow men, and the event was accompanied by phrases about the glory of France, the baseness of England, and so on. History shows us that these justifications of the events have no common sense and are all contradictory, as in the case of killing a man as the result of recognizing his rights, and the killing of millions in Russia for the humiliation of England. But these justifications have a very necessary significance in their own day.\n\nThese justifications release those who produce the events from moral responsibility. These temporary aims are like the broom fixed in front of a locomotive to clear the snow from the rails in front: they clear men\u2019s moral responsibilities from their path.\n\nWithout such justification there would be no reply to the simplest question that presents itself when examining each historical event. How is it that millions of men commit collective crimes\u2014make war, commit murder, and so on?\n\nWith the present complex forms of political and social life in Europe can any event that is not prescribed, decreed, or ordered by monarchs, ministers, parliaments, or newspapers be imagined? Is there any collective action which cannot find its justification in political unity, in patriotism, in the balance of power, or in civilization? So that every event that occurs inevitably coincides with some expressed wish and, receiving a justification, presents itself as the result of the will of one man or of several men.\n\nIn whatever direction a ship moves, the flow of the waves it cuts will always be noticeable ahead of it. To those on board the ship the movement of those waves will be the only perceptible motion.\n\nOnly by watching closely moment by moment the movement of that flow and comparing it with the movement of the ship do we convince ourselves that every bit of it is occasioned by the forward movement of the ship, and that we were led into error by the fact that we ourselves were imperceptibly moving.\n\nWe see the same if we watch moment by moment the movement of historical characters (that is, re-establish the inevitable condition of all that occurs\u2014the continuity of movement in time) and do not lose sight of the essential connection of historical persons with the masses.\n\nWhen the ship moves in one direction there is one and the same wave ahead of it, when it turns frequently the wave ahead of it also turns frequently. But wherever it may turn there always will be the wave anticipating its movement.\n\nWhatever happens it always appears that just that event was foreseen and decreed. Wherever the ship may go, the rush of water which neither directs nor increases its movement foams ahead of it, and at a distance seems to us not merely to move of itself but to govern the ship\u2019s movement also.\n\nExamining only those expressions of the will of historical persons which, as commands, were related to events, historians have assumed that the events depended on those commands. But examining the events themselves and the connection in which the historical persons stood to the people, we have found that they and their orders were dependent on events. The incontestable proof of this deduction is that, however many commands were issued, the event does not take place unless there are other causes for it, but as soon as an event occurs\u2014be it what it may\u2014then out of all the continually expressed wishes of different people some will always be found which by their meaning and their time of utterance are related as commands to the events.\n\nArriving at this conclusion we can reply directly and positively to these two essential questions of history:\n\n(1) What is power?\n\n(2) What force produces the movement of the nations?\n\n(1) Power is the relation of a given person to other individuals, in which the more this person expresses opinions, predictions, and justifications of the collective action that is performed, the less is his participation in that action.\n\n(2) The movement of nations is caused not by power, nor by intellectual activity, nor even by a combination of the two as historians have supposed, but by the activity of all the people who participate in the events, and who always combine in such a way that those taking the largest direct share in the event take on themselves the least responsibility and vice versa.\n\nMorally the wielder of power appears to cause the event; physically it is those who submit to the power. But as the moral activity is inconceivable without the physical, the cause of the event is neither in the one nor in the other but in the union of the two.\n\nOr in other words, the conception of a cause is inapplicable to the phenomena we are examining.\n\nIn the last analysis we reach the circle of infinity\u2014that final limit to which in every domain of thought man\u2019s reason arrives if it is not playing with the subject. Electricity produces heat, heat produces electricity. Atoms attract each other and atoms repel one another.\n\nSpeaking of the interaction of heat and electricity and of atoms, we cannot say why this occurs, and we say that it is so because it is inconceivable otherwise, because it must be so and that it is a law. The same applies to historical events. Why war and revolution occur we do not know. We only know that to produce the one or the other action, people combine in a certain formation in which they all take part, and we say that this is so because it is unthinkable otherwise, or in other words that it is a law.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER VIII\n\nIf history dealt only with external phenomena, the establishment of this simple and obvious law would suffice and we should have finished our argument. But the law of history relates to man. A particle of matter cannot tell us that it does not feel the law of attraction or repulsion and that that law is untrue, but man, who is the subject of history, says plainly: I am free and am therefore not subject to the law.\n\nThe presence of the problem of man\u2019s free will, though unexpressed, is felt at every step of history.\n\nAll seriously thinking historians have involuntarily encountered this question. All the contradictions and obscurities of history and the false path historical science has followed are due solely to the lack of a solution of that question.\n\nIf the will of every man were free, that is, if each man could act as he pleased, all history would be a series of disconnected incidents.\n\nIf in a thousand years even one man in a million could act freely, that is, as he chose, it is evident that one single free act of that man\u2019s in violation of the laws governing human action would destroy the possibility of the existence of any laws for the whole of humanity.\n\nIf there be a single law governing the actions of men, free will cannot exist, for then man\u2019s will is subject to that law.\n\nIn this contradiction lies the problem of free will, which from most ancient times has occupied the best human minds and from most ancient times has been presented in its whole tremendous significance.\n\nThe problem is that regarding man as a subject of observation from whatever point of view\u2014theological, historical, ethical, or philosophic\u2014we find a general law of necessity to which he (like all that exists) is subject. But regarding him from within ourselves as what we are conscious of, we feel ourselves to be free.\n\nThis consciousness is a source of self-cognition quite apart from and independent of reason. Through his reason man observes himself, but only through consciousness does he know himself.\n\nApart from consciousness of self no observation or application of reason is conceivable.\n\nTo understand, observe, and draw conclusions, man must first of all be conscious of himself as living. A man is only conscious of himself as a living being by the fact that he wills, that is, is conscious of his volition. But his will\u2014which forms the essence of his life\u2014man recognizes (and can but recognize) as free.\n\nIf, observing himself, man sees that his will is always directed by one and the same law (whether he observes the necessity of taking food, using his brain, or anything else) he cannot recognize this never-varying direction of his will otherwise than as a limitation of it. Were it not free it could not be limited. A man\u2019s will seems to him to be limited just because he is not conscious of it except as free.\n\nYou say: I am not free. But I have lifted my hand and let it fall. Everyone understands that this illogical reply is an irrefutable demonstration of freedom.\n\nThat reply is the expression of a consciousness that is not subject to reason.\n\nIf the consciousness of freedom were not a separate and independent source of self-consciousness it would be subject to reasoning and to experience, but in fact such subjection does not exist and is inconceivable.\n\nA series of experiments and arguments proves to every man that he, as an object of observation, is subject to certain laws, and man submits to them and never resists the laws of gravity or impermeability once he has become acquainted with them. But the same series of experiments and arguments proves to him that the complete freedom of which he is conscious in himself is impossible, and that his every action depends on his organization, his character, and the motives acting upon him; yet man never submits to the deductions of these experiments and arguments. Having learned from experiment and argument that a stone falls downwards, a man indubitably believes this and always expects the law that he has learned to be fulfilled.\n\nBut learning just as certainly that his will is subject to laws, he does not and cannot believe this.\n\nHowever often experiment and reasoning may show a man that under the same conditions and with the same character he will do the same thing as before, yet when under the same conditions and with the same character he approaches for the thousandth time the action that always ends in the same way, he feels as certainly convinced as before the experiment that he can act as he pleases. Every man, savage or sage, however incontestably reason and experiment may prove to him that it is impossible to imagine two different courses of action in precisely the same conditions, feels that without this irrational conception (which constitutes the essence of freedom) he cannot imagine life. He feels that however impossible it may be, it is so, for without this conception of freedom not only would he be unable to understand life, but he would be unable to live for a single moment.\n\nHe could not live, because all man\u2019s efforts, all his impulses to life, are only efforts to increase freedom. Wealth and poverty, fame and obscurity, power and subordination, strength and weakness, health and disease, culture and ignorance, work and leisure, repletion and hunger, virtue and vice, are only greater or lesser degrees of freedom.\n\nA man having no freedom cannot be conceived of except as deprived of life.\n\nIf the conception of freedom appears to reason to be a senseless contradiction like the possibility of performing two actions at one and the same instant of time, or of an effect without a cause, that only proves that consciousness is not subject to reason.\n\nThis unshakable, irrefutable consciousness of freedom, uncontrolled by experiment or argument, recognized by all thinkers and felt by everyone without exception, this consciousness without which no conception of man is possible constitutes the other side of the question.\n\nMan is the creation of an all-powerful, all-good, and all-seeing God. What is sin, the conception of which arises from the consciousness of man\u2019s freedom? That is a question for theology.\n\nThe actions of men are subject to general immutable laws expressed in statistics. What is man\u2019s responsibility to society, the conception of which results from the conception of freedom? That is a question for jurisprudence.\n\nMan\u2019s actions proceed from his innate character and the motives acting upon him. What is conscience and the perception of right and wrong in actions that follows from the consciousness of freedom? That is a question for ethics.\n\nMan in connection with the general life of humanity appears subject to laws which determine that life. But the same man apart from that connection appears to be free. How should the past life of nations and of humanity be regarded\u2014as the result of the free, or as the result of the constrained, activity of man? That is a question for history.\n\nOnly in our self-confident day of the popularization of knowledge\u2014thanks to that most powerful engine of ignorance, the diffusion of printed matter\u2014has the question of the freedom of will been put on a level on which the question itself cannot exist. In our time the majority of so-called advanced people\u2014that is, the crowd of ignoramuses\u2014have taken the work of the naturalists who deal with one side of the question for a solution of the whole problem.\n\nThey say and write and print that the soul and freedom do not exist, for the life of man is expressed by muscular movements and muscular movements are conditioned by the activity of the nerves; the soul and free will do not exist because at an unknown period of time we sprang from the apes. They say this, not at all suspecting that thousands of years ago that same law of necessity which with such ardor they are now trying to prove by physiology and comparative zoology was not merely acknowledged by all the religions and all the thinkers, but has never been denied. They do not see that the role of the natural sciences in this matter is merely to serve as an instrument for the illumination of one side of it. For the fact that, from the point of view of observation, reason and the will are merely secretions of the brain, and that man following the general law may have developed from lower animals at some unknown period of time, only explains from a fresh side the truth admitted thousands of years ago by all the religious and philosophic theories\u2014that from the point of view of reason man is subject to the law of necessity; but it does not advance by a hair\u2019s breadth the solution of the question, which has another, opposite, side, based on the consciousness of freedom.\n\nIf men descended from the apes at an unknown period of time, that is as comprehensible as that they were made from a handful of earth at a certain period of time (in the first case the unknown quantity is the time, in the second case it is the origin); and the question of how man\u2019s consciousness of freedom is to be reconciled with the law of necessity to which he is subject cannot be solved by comparative physiology and zoology, for in a frog, a rabbit, or an ape, we can observe only the muscular nervous activity, but in man we observe consciousness as well as the muscular and nervous activity.\n\nThe naturalists and their followers, thinking they can solve this question, are like plasterers set to plaster one side of the walls of a church who, availing themselves of the absence of the chief superintendent of the work, should in an access of zeal plaster over the windows, icons, woodwork, and still unbuttressed walls, and should be delighted that from their point of view as plasterers, everything is now so smooth and regular.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER IX\n\nFor the solution of the question of free will or inevitability, history has this advantage over other branches of knowledge in which the question is dealt with, that for history this question does not refer to the essence of man\u2019s free will but its manifestation in the past and under certain conditions.\n\nIn regard to this question, history stands to the other sciences as experimental science stands to abstract science.\n\nThe subject for history is not man\u2019s will itself but our presentation of it.\n\nAnd so for history, the insoluble mystery presented by the incompatibility of free will and inevitability does not exist as it does for theology, ethics, and philosophy. History surveys a presentation of man\u2019s life in which the union of these two contradictions has already taken place.\n\nIn actual life each historic event, each human action, is very clearly and definitely understood without any sense of contradiction, although each event presents itself as partly free and partly compulsory.\n\nTo solve the question of how freedom and necessity are combined and what constitutes the essence of these two conceptions, the philosophy of history can and should follow a path contrary to that taken by other sciences. Instead of first defining the conceptions of freedom and inevitability in themselves, and then ranging the phenomena of life under those definitions, history should deduce a definition of the conception of freedom and inevitability themselves from the immense quantity of phenomena of which it is cognizant and that always appear dependent on these two elements.\n\nWhatever presentation of the activity of many men or of an individual we may consider, we always regard it as the result partly of man\u2019s free will and partly of the law of inevitability.\n\nWhether we speak of the migration of the peoples and the incursions of the barbarians, or of the decrees of Napoleon III, or of someone\u2019s action an hour ago in choosing one direction out of several for his walk, we are unconscious of any contradiction. The degree of freedom and inevitability governing the actions of these people is clearly defined for us.\n\nOur conception of the degree of freedom often varies according to differences in the point of view from which we regard the event, but every human action appears to us as a certain combination of freedom and inevitability. In every action we examine we see a certain measure of freedom and a certain measure of inevitability. And always the more freedom we see in any action the less inevitability do we perceive, and the more inevitability the less freedom.\n\nThe proportion of freedom to inevitability decreases and increases according to the point of view from which the action is regarded, but their relation is always one of inverse proportion.\n\nA sinking man who clutches at another and drowns him; or a hungry mother exhausted by feeding her baby, who steals some food; or a man trained to discipline who on duty at the word of command kills a defenseless man\u2014seem less guilty, that is, less free and more subject to the law of necessity, to one who knows the circumstances in which these people were placed, and more free to one who does not know that the man was himself drowning, that the mother was hungry, that the soldier was in the ranks, and so on. Similarly a man who committed a murder twenty years ago and has since lived peaceably and harmlessly in society seems less guilty and his action more due to the law of inevitability, to someone who considers his action after twenty years have elapsed than to one who examined it the day after it was committed. And in the same way every action of an insane, intoxicated, or highly excited man appears less free and more inevitable to one who knows the mental condition of him who committed the action, and seems more free and less inevitable to one who does not know it. In all these cases the conception of freedom is increased or diminished and the conception of compulsion is correspondingly decreased or increased, according to the point of view from which the action is regarded. So that the greater the conception of necessity the smaller the conception of freedom and vice versa.\n\nReligion, the common sense of mankind, the science of jurisprudence, and history itself understand alike this relation between necessity and freedom.\n\nAll cases without exception in which our conception of freedom and necessity is increased and diminished depend on three considerations:\n\n(1) The relation to the external world of the man who commits the deeds.\n\n(2) His relation to time.\n\n(3) His relation to the causes leading to the action.\n\nThe first consideration is the clearness of our perception of the man\u2019s relation to the external world and the greater or lesser clearness of our understanding of the definite position occupied by the man in relation to everything coexisting with him. This is what makes it evident that a drowning man is less free and more subject to necessity than one standing on dry ground, and that makes the actions of a man closely connected with others in a thickly populated district, or of one bound by family, official, or business duties, seem certainly less free and more subject to necessity than those of a man living in solitude and seclusion.\n\nIf we consider a man alone, apart from his relation to everything around him, each action of his seems to us free. But if we see his relation to anything around him, if we see his connection with anything whatever\u2014with a man who speaks to him, a book he reads, the work on which he is engaged, even with the air he breathes or the light that falls on the things about him\u2014we see that each of these circumstances has an influence on him and controls at least some side of his activity. And the more we perceive of these influences the more our conception of his freedom diminishes and the more our conception of the necessity that weighs on him increases.\n\nThe second consideration is the more or less evident time relation of the man to the world and the clearness of our perception of the place the man\u2019s action occupies in time. That is the ground which makes the fall of the first man, resulting in the production of the human race, appear evidently less free than a man\u2019s entry into marriage today. It is the reason why the life and activity of people who lived centuries ago and are connected with me in time cannot seem to me as free as the life of a contemporary, the consequences of which are still unknown to me.\n\nThe degree of our conception of freedom or inevitability depends in this respect on the greater or lesser lapse of time between the performance of the action and our judgment of it.\n\nIf I examine an act I performed a moment ago in approximately the same circumstances as those I am in now, my action appears to me undoubtedly free. But if I examine an act performed a month ago, then being in different circumstances, I cannot help recognizing that if that act had not been committed much that resulted from it\u2014good, agreeable, and even essential\u2014would not have taken place. If I reflect on an action still more remote, ten years ago or more, then the consequences of my action are still plainer to me and I find it hard to imagine what would have happened had that action not been performed. The farther I go back in memory, or what is the same thing the farther I go forward in my judgment, the more doubtful becomes my belief in the freedom of my action.\n\nIn history we find a very similar progress of conviction concerning the part played by free will in the general affairs of humanity. A contemporary event seems to us to be indubitably the doing of all the known participants, but with a more remote event we already see its inevitable results which prevent our considering anything else possible. And the farther we go back in examining events the less arbitrary do they appear.\n\nThe Austro-Prussian war appears to us undoubtedly the result of the crafty conduct of Bismarck, and so on. The Napoleonic wars still seem to us, though already questionably, to be the outcome of their heroes\u2019 will. But in the Crusades we already see an event occupying its definite place in history and without which we cannot imagine the modern history of Europe, though to the chroniclers of the Crusades that event appeared as merely due to the will of certain people. In regard to the migration of the peoples it does not enter anyone\u2019s head today to suppose that the renovation of the European world depended on Attila\u2019s caprice. The farther back in history the object of our observation lies, the more doubtful does the free will of those concerned in the event become and the more manifest the law of inevitability.\n\nThe third consideration is the degree to which we apprehend that endless chain of causation inevitably demanded by reason, in which each phenomenon comprehended, and therefore man\u2019s every action, must have its definite place as a result of what has gone before and as a cause of what will follow.\n\nThe better we are acquainted with the physiological, psychological, and historical laws deduced by observation and by which man is controlled, and the more correctly we perceive the physiological, psychological, and historical causes of the action, and the simpler the action we are observing and the less complex the character and mind of the man in question, the more subject to inevitability and the less free do our actions and those of others appear.\n\nWhen we do not at all understand the cause of an action, whether a crime, a good action, or even one that is simply nonmoral, we ascribe a greater amount of freedom to it. In the case of a crime we most urgently demand the punishment for such an act; in the case of a virtuous act we rate its merit most highly. In an indifferent case we recognize in it more individuality, originality, and independence. But if even one of the innumerable causes of the act is known to us we recognize a certain element of necessity and are less insistent on punishment for the crime, or the acknowledgment of the merit of the virtuous act, or the freedom of the apparently original action. That a criminal was reared among malefactors mitigates his fault in our eyes. The self-sacrifice of a father or mother, or self-sacrifice with the possibility of a reward, is more comprehensible than gratuitous self-sacrifice, and therefore seems less deserving of sympathy and less the result of free will. The founder of a sect or party, or an inventor, impresses us less when we know how or by what the way was prepared for his activity. If we have a large range of examples, if our observation is constantly directed to seeking the correlation of cause and effect in people\u2019s actions, their actions appear to us more under compulsion and less free the more correctly we connect the effects with the causes. If we examined simple actions and had a vast number of such actions under observation, our conception of their inevitability would be still greater. The dishonest conduct of the son of a dishonest father, the misconduct of a woman who had fallen into bad company, a drunkard\u2019s relapse into drunkenness, and so on are actions that seem to us less free the better we understand their cause. If the man whose actions we are considering is on a very low stage of mental development, like a child, a madman, or a simpleton\u2014then, knowing the causes of the act and the simplicity of the character and intelligence in question, we see so large an element of necessity and so little free will that as soon as we know the cause prompting the action we can foretell the result.\n\nOn these three considerations alone is based the conception of irresponsibility for crimes and the extenuating circumstances admitted by all legislative codes. The responsibility appears greater or less according to our greater or lesser knowledge of the circumstances in which the man was placed whose action is being judged, and according to the greater or lesser interval of time between the commission of the action and its investigation, and according to the greater or lesser understanding of the causes that led to the action.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER X\n\nThus our conception of free will and inevitability gradually diminishes or increases according to the greater or lesser connection with the external world, the greater or lesser remoteness of time, and the greater or lesser dependence on the causes in relation to which we contemplate a man\u2019s life.\n\nSo that if we examine the case of a man whose connection with the external world is well known, where the time between the action and its examination is great, and where the causes of the action are most accessible, we get the conception of a maximum of inevitability and a minimum of free will. If we examine a man little dependent on external conditions, whose action was performed very recently, and the causes of whose action are beyond our ken, we get the conception of a minimum of inevitability and a maximum of freedom.\n\nIn neither case\u2014however we may change our point of view, however plain we may make to ourselves the connection between the man and the external world, however inaccessible it may be to us, however long or short the period of time, however intelligible or incomprehensible the causes of the action may be\u2014can we ever conceive either complete freedom or complete necessity.\n\n(1) To whatever degree we may imagine a man to be exempt from the influence of the external world, we never get a conception of freedom in space. Every human action is inevitably conditioned by what surrounds him and by his own body. I lift my arm and let it fall. My action seems to me free; but asking myself whether I could raise my arm in every direction, I see that I raised it in the direction in which there was least obstruction to that action either from things around me or from the construction of my own body. I chose one out of all the possible directions because in it there were fewest obstacles. For my action to be free it was necessary that it should encounter no obstacles. To conceive of a man being free we must imagine him outside space, which is evidently impossible.\n\n(2) However much we approximate the time of judgment to the time of the deed, we never get a conception of freedom in time. For if I examine an action committed a second ago I must still recognize it as not being free, for it is irrevocably linked to the moment at which it was committed. Can I lift my arm? I lift it, but ask myself: could I have abstained from lifting my arm at the moment that has already passed? To convince myself of this I do not lift it the next moment. But I am not now abstaining from doing so at the first moment when I asked the question. Time has gone by which I could not detain, the arm I then lifted is no longer the same as the arm I now refrain from lifting, nor is the air in which I lifted it the same that now surrounds me. The moment in which the first movement was made is irrevocable, and at that moment I could make only one movement, and whatever movement I made would be the only one. That I did not lift my arm a moment later does not prove that I could have abstained from lifting it then. And since I could make only one movement at that single moment of time, it could not have been any other. To imagine it as free, it is necessary to imagine it in the present, on the boundary between the past and the future\u2014that is, outside time, which is impossible.\n\n(3) However much the difficulty of understanding the causes may be increased, we never reach a conception of complete freedom, that is, an absence of cause. However inaccessible to us may be the cause of the expression of will in any action, our own or another\u2019s, the first demand of reason is the assumption of and search for a cause, for without a cause no phenomenon is conceivable. I raise my arm to perform an action independently of any cause, but my wish to perform an action without a cause is the cause of my action.\n\nBut even if\u2014imagining a man quite exempt from all influences, examining only his momentary action in the present, unevoked by any cause\u2014we were to admit so infinitely small a remainder of inevitability as equaled zero, we should even then not have arrived at the conception of complete freedom in man, for a being uninfluenced by the external world, standing outside of time and independent of cause, is no longer a man.\n\nIn the same way we can never imagine the action of a man quite devoid of freedom and entirely subject to the law of inevitability.\n\n(1) However we may increase our knowledge of the conditions of space in which man is situated, that knowledge can never be complete, for the number of those conditions is as infinite as the infinity of space. And therefore so long as not all the conditions influencing men are defined, there is no complete inevitability but a certain measure of freedom remains.\n\n(2) However we may prolong the period of time between the action we are examining and the judgment upon it, that period will be finite, while time is infinite, and so in this respect too there can never be absolute inevitability.\n\n(3) However accessible may be the chain of causation of any action, we shall never know the whole chain since it is endless, and so again we never reach absolute inevitability.\n\nBut besides this, even if, admitting the remaining minimum of freedom to equal zero, we assumed in some given case\u2014as for instance in that of a dying man, an unborn babe, or an idiot\u2014complete absence of freedom, by so doing we should destroy the very conception of man in the case we are examining, for as soon as there is no freedom there is also no man. And so the conception of the action of a man subject solely to the law of inevitability without any element of freedom is just as impossible as the conception of a man\u2019s completely free action.\n\nAnd so to imagine the action of a man entirely subject to the law of inevitability without any freedom, we must assume the knowledge of an infinite number of space relations, an infinitely long period of time, and an infinite series of causes.\n\nTo imagine a man perfectly free and not subject to the law of inevitability, we must imagine him all alone, beyond space, beyond time, and free from dependence on cause.\n\nIn the first case, if inevitability were possible without freedom we should have reached a definition of inevitability by the laws of inevitability itself, that is, a mere form without content.\n\nIn the second case, if freedom were possible without inevitability we should have arrived at unconditioned freedom beyond space, time, and cause, which by the fact of its being unconditioned and unlimited would be nothing, or mere content without form.\n\nWe should in fact have reached those two fundamentals of which man\u2019s whole outlook on the universe is constructed\u2014the incomprehensible essence of life, and the laws defining that essence.\n\nReason says: (1) space with all the forms of matter that give it visibility is infinite, and cannot be imagined otherwise. (2) Time is infinite motion without a moment of rest and is unthinkable otherwise. (3) The connection between cause and effect has no beginning and can have no end.\n\nConsciousness says: (1) I alone am, and all that exists is but me, consequently I include space. (2) I measure flowing time by the fixed moment of the present in which alone I am conscious of myself as living, consequently I am outside time. (3) I am beyond cause, for I feel myself to be the cause of every manifestation of my life.\n\nReason gives expression to the laws of inevitability. Consciousness gives expression to the essence of freedom.\n\nFreedom not limited by anything is the essence of life, in man\u2019s consciousness. Inevitability without content is man\u2019s reason in its three forms.\n\nFreedom is the thing examined. Inevitability is what examines. Freedom is the content. Inevitability is the form.\n\nOnly by separating the two sources of cognition, related to one another as form to content, do we get the mutually exclusive and separately incomprehensible conceptions of freedom and inevitability.\n\nOnly by uniting them do we get a clear conception of man\u2019s life.\n\nApart from these two concepts which in their union mutually define one another as form and content, no conception of life is possible.\n\nAll that we know of the life of man is merely a certain relation of free will to inevitability, that is, of consciousness to the laws of reason.\n\nAll that we know of the external world of nature is only a certain relation of the forces of nature to inevitability, or of the essence of life to the laws of reason.\n\nThe great natural forces lie outside us and we are not conscious of them; we call those forces gravitation, inertia, electricity, animal force, and so on, but we are conscious of the force of life in man and we call that freedom.\n\nBut just as the force of gravitation, incomprehensible in itself but felt by every man, is understood by us only to the extent to which we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the first knowledge that all bodies have weight, up to Newton\u2019s law), so too the force of free will, incomprehensible in itself but of which everyone is conscious, is intelligible to us only in as far as we know the laws of inevitability to which it is subject (from the fact that every man dies, up to the knowledge of the most complex economic and historic laws).\n\nAll knowledge is merely a bringing of this essence of life under the laws of reason.\n\nMan\u2019s free will differs from every other force in that man is directly conscious of it, but in the eyes of reason it in no way differs from any other force. The forces of gravitation, electricity, or chemical affinity are only distinguished from one another in that they are differently defined by reason. Just so the force of man\u2019s free will is distinguished by reason from the other forces of nature only by the definition reason gives it. Freedom, apart from necessity, that is, apart from the laws of reason that define it, differs in no way from gravitation, or heat, or the force that makes things grow; for reason, it is only a momentary undefinable sensation of life.\n\nAnd as the undefinable essence of the force moving the heavenly bodies, the undefinable essence of the forces of heat and electricity, or of chemical affinity, or of the vital force, forms the content of astronomy, physics, chemistry, botany, zoology, and so on, just in the same way does the force of free will form the content of history. But just as the subject of every science is the manifestation of this unknown essence of life while that essence itself can only be the subject of metaphysics, even the manifestation of the force of free will in human beings in space, in time, and in dependence on cause forms the subject of history, while free will itself is the subject of metaphysics.\n\nIn the experimental sciences what we know we call the laws of inevitability, what is unknown to us we call vital force. Vital force is only an expression for the unknown remainder over and above what we know of the essence of life.\n\nSo also in history what is known to us we call laws of inevitability, what is unknown we call free will. Free will is for history only an expression for the unknown remainder of what we know about the laws of human life.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XI\n\nHistory examines the manifestations of man\u2019s free will in connection with the external world in time and in dependence on cause, that is, it defines this freedom by the laws of reason, and so history is a science only in so far as this free will is defined by those laws.\n\nThe recognition of man\u2019s free will as something capable of influencing historical events, that is, as not subject to laws, is the same for history as the recognition of a free force moving the heavenly bodies would be for astronomy.\n\nThat assumption would destroy the possibility of the existence of laws, that is, of any science whatever. If there is even a single body moving freely, then the laws of Kepler and Newton are negatived and no conception of the movement of the heavenly bodies any longer exists. If any single action is due to free will, then not a single historical law can exist, nor any conception of historical events.\n\nFor history, lines exist of the movement of human wills, one end of which is hidden in the unknown but at the other end of which a consciousness of man\u2019s will in the present moves in space, time, and dependence on cause.\n\nThe more this field of motion spreads out before our eyes, the more evident are the laws of that movement. To discover and define those laws is the problem of history.\n\nFrom the standpoint from which the science of history now regards its subject on the path it now follows, seeking the causes of events in man\u2019s free will, a scientific enunciation of those laws is impossible, for however man\u2019s free will may be restricted, as soon as we recognize it as a force not subject to law, the existence of law becomes impossible.\n\nOnly by reducing this element of free will to the infinitesimal, that is, by regarding it as an infinitely small quantity, can we convince ourselves of the absolute inaccessibility of the causes, and then instead of seeking causes, history will take the discovery of laws as its problem.\n\nThe search for these laws has long been begun and the new methods of thought which history must adopt are being worked out simultaneously with the self-destruction toward which\u2014ever dissecting and dissecting the causes of phenomena\u2014the old method of history is moving.\n\nAll human sciences have traveled along that path. Arriving at infinitesimals, mathematics, the most exact of sciences, abandons the process of analysis and enters on the new process of the integration of unknown, infinitely small, quantities. Abandoning the conception of cause, mathematics seeks law, that is, the property common to all unknown, infinitely small, elements.\n\nIn another form but along the same path of reflection the other sciences have proceeded. When Newton enunciated the law of gravity he did not say that the sun or the earth had a property of attraction; he said that all bodies from the largest to the smallest have the property of attracting one another, that is, leaving aside the question of the cause of the movement of the bodies, he expressed the property common to all bodies from the infinitely large to the infinitely small. The same is done by the natural sciences: leaving aside the question of cause, they seek for laws. History stands on the same path. And if history has for its object the study of the movement of the nations and of humanity and not the narration of episodes in the lives of individuals, it too, setting aside the conception of cause, should seek the laws common to all the inseparably interconnected infinitesimal elements of free will.\n\n\n\nCHAPTER XII\n\nFrom the time the law of Copernicus was discovered and proved, the mere recognition of the fact that it was not the sun but the earth that moves sufficed to destroy the whole cosmography of the ancients. By disproving that law it might have been possible to retain the old conception of the movements of the bodies, but without disproving it, it would seem impossible to continue studying the Ptolemaic worlds. But even after the discovery of the law of Copernicus the Ptolemaic worlds were still studied for a long time.\n\nFrom the time the first person said and proved that the number of births or of crimes is subject to mathematical laws, and that this or that mode of government is determined by certain geographical and economic conditions, and that certain relations of population to soil produce migrations of peoples, the foundations on which history had been built were destroyed in their essence.\n\nBy refuting these new laws the former view of history might have been retained; but without refuting them it would seem impossible to continue studying historic events as the results of man\u2019s free will. For if a certain mode of government was established or certain migrations of peoples took place in consequence of such and such geographic, ethnographic, or economic conditions, then the free will of those individuals who appear to us to have established that mode of government or occasioned the migrations can no longer be regarded as the cause.\n\nAnd yet the former history continues to be studied side by side with the laws of statistics, geography, political economy, comparative philology, and geology, which directly contradict its assumptions.\n\nThe struggle between the old views and the new was long and stubbornly fought out in physical philosophy. Theology stood on guard for the old views and accused the new of violating revelation. But when truth conquered, theology established itself just as firmly on the new foundation.\n\nJust as prolonged and stubborn is the struggle now proceeding between the old and the new conception of history, and theology in the same way stands on guard for the old view, and accuses the new view of subverting revelation.\n\nIn the one case as in the other, on both sides the struggle provokes passion and stifles truth. On the one hand there is fear and regret for the loss of the whole edifice constructed through the ages, on the other is the passion for destruction.\n\nTo the men who fought against the rising truths of physical philosophy, it seemed that if they admitted that truth it would destroy faith in God, in the creation of the firmament, and in the miracle of Joshua the son of Nun. To the defenders of the laws of Copernicus and Newton, to Voltaire for example, it seemed that the laws of astronomy destroyed religion, and he utilized the law of gravitation as a weapon against religion.\n\nJust so it now seems as if we have only to admit the law of inevitability, to destroy the conception of the soul, of good and evil, and all the institutions of state and church that have been built up on those conceptions.\n\nSo too, like Voltaire in his time, uninvited defenders of the law of inevitability today use that law as a weapon against religion, though the law of inevitability in history, like the law of Copernicus in astronomy, far from destroying, even strengthens the foundation on which the institutions of state and church are erected.\n\nAs in the question of astronomy then, so in the question of history now, the whole difference of opinion is based on the recognition or nonrecognition of something absolute, serving as the measure of visible phenomena. In astronomy it was the immovability of the earth, in history it is the independence of personality\u2014free will.\n\nAs with astronomy the difficulty of recognizing the motion of the earth lay in abandoning the immediate sensation of the earth\u2019s fixity and of the motion of the planets, so in history the difficulty of recognizing the subjection of personality to the laws of space, time, and cause lies in renouncing the direct feeling of the independence of one\u2019s own personality. But as in astronomy the new view said: \u201cIt is true that we do not feel the movement of the earth, but by admitting its immobility we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting its motion (which we do not feel) we arrive at laws,\u201d so also in history the new view says: \u201cIt is true that we are not conscious of our dependence, but by admitting our free will we arrive at absurdity, while by admitting our dependence on the external world, on time, and on cause, we arrive at laws.\u201d\n\nIn the first case it was necessary to renounce the consciousness of an unreal immobility in space and to recognize a motion we did not feel; in the present case it is similarly necessary to renounce a freedom that does not exist, and to recognize a dependence of which we are not conscious.\n", "sequence": 31}]
